2,10,11,6,12,2012,2012-12-06,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: THE SCAR PROJECT: BREAST CANCER IS NOT A PINK RIBBON AND THE ALABAMA PROJECT: THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF HEALTH CARE TO PREMIERE IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA JANUARY 7-31, 2013 Birmingham, Alabama—December 6, 2012—Two groundbreaking photographic exhibitions shot by fashion photographer David Jay are set to premiere at University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Visual Arts Gallery: The SCAR Project: Breast Cancer Is Not A Pink Ribbon and The Alabama Project: The Civil Rights of Health Care. The dual exhibition opens January 7 and runs through January 31, 2013. There will be a ticketed opening night gala on January 11, 5-9pm. General admission to the exhibitions, is free. Private gallery tours with photographer David Jay will be available. Regular screenings of Baring It All, the EMMY Award winning documentary about The SCAR Project will be shown throughout the exhibition. The SCAR Project is a series of large-scale portraits of young women confronting breast cancer shot by fashion photographer David Jay. The SCAR Project puts a raw, unflinching face on young women and breast cancer while paying tribute to the courage and spirit of the many brave, young women fighting this disease. The SCAR Project subjects range in age from 18-35 and represent the often overlooked, group of young women living with breast cancer in our country today. They’ve journeyed from across America and the world to be photographed for The SCAR Project. More than 100 women have been photographed thus far. The Alabama Project: The Civil Rights of Health Care is a subset of The SCAR Project. In this project Jay documents a group of young women in Alabama, all in their twenties, battling not only breast cancer but the healthcare system itself. From hospital room to the living room, Jay’s poignant images capture each woman’s faith, perseverance, and beauty.

3,10,12,8,1,2013,2013-01-08,"[With The SCAR Project premiering in Birmingham this week, quite a few of the SCAR girls are heading south with the birds and tide…and the blazers for the cocktail party artist reception this Friday night at UAB’s Visual Arts Gallery. SCAR girl Sara is one of the many flocking together for the event. She worked out her pre-flight details in today’s guest post, which is also published on her blog: That Girl…tales from the edge.] by Sara Bartosiewicz-Hamilton This is my life…I had my implants removed mid-December…based on how I felt, I didn’t think I would be ready. At first, I thought I wouldn’t be ready because I would be self-conscious. After the fact, I thought I wouldn’t be ready because I wasn’t recovering as quickly. Either way, I thought I would not be going to the latest SCAR Project exhibit…and then…I woke up Friday with this urge. I wanted to be with my SCAR family…I wanted to see the photos…I wanted to be there. So, I texted my hubby who was getting off his 12 hour shift and headed to sleep in the parking lot of his barber until the shop opened… I need an honest opinion of trying to go to Birmingham for a few days next week for the SCAR exhibit – I can’t explain it. I just feel the need to go. And I just waited…I know I am spontaneous. I can change in a moment. Ahhh, such is life with me. The heart-warming part is the part where my hubby tries to understand, doesn’t always get there but has learned it is usually best to just let me go in whatever direction I’m trying…it may not work but NOT trying is usually worse. I was prepared for his opinion that this may not be best, I’m still not fully recovered…and, I had told myself, if this was his opinion, I needed to listen to him. Thankfully, he got home and told me to buy the ticket…do you know how quickly this can be done??? Within fifteen minutes, actually…flight booked, hotel called. And I’m headed to BAMA!! This exhibit is a bit different – it started yesterday, the gala event isn’t until Friday. What this means? I’m not arriving until Thursday but am seeing photo after photo of the pictures being hung. I’m going NUTS!!! I just want to be there…I want to take them all in…each time is a little different, who is hanging, who they are hanging by. This time we have new photos and new sisters to welcome. I.can.NOT.wait. So, I guess I’m doing a bit of my prep work here…online. And, I thought I would share with everyone else what this is like…in all sincerity, I truly believe EVERY single person in the world should be able to experience a SCAR Project exhibit because it is like no other. The photos grab you…meeting people…the love in the room…we love each other like family…the kind of family you actually want to be around. The SCAR models talk about the photos, we talk about our journeys but we really want to talk to you. What made you come see the exhibit? How did you hear about it? What do you think? Do you have cancer? Did you? Have you been touched by cancer? Maybe a friend…a cousin…your mom…tell me about your experience. Tell me what the photos mean to you from the perspective of your journey. It becomes one major love-fest and every single time I walk away blown away by the people I had the honor to meet and the stories I was able to hear. The first exhibit, I was too nervous…I was welling up…and I am an ugly-crier. So, when the exhibit came to Cincinnati (still had to spell that twice to get it right!), I went to the gallery the moment I arrived. I thought if I was around the photos, I could get those emotions moving so I could be composed at the event. It worked. You know the feeling of coming home to your own bed after a trip? That’s the feeling I get when I walk into a gallery with the SCAR photos. I know the stories and the person behind most of the photos…I want you to love them as much as I do. But it also makes me reflect on my BRCA journey and the impact cancer has had on my life and in the lives of those I cherish…so it is a lot flying through my mind. Those emotions are flying as I watch the pictures go up on facebook of the photos being hung in the gallery. The space is beautiful, as always. The photos grab me. I am “awww”ing at who is being hung by whom. I am wanting to reach out and touch the photo of my friend Gabrielle who was with me the day my photograph was taken…I am wanting to hug a SCAR sister as we look at Jolene’s photo. I have never met or heard of anyone who was not changed by attending the exhibit. I am incredibly excited. Can you tell? People are never sure what to expect. I understand completely. Before the first exhibit, I was seriously stressed. What do I wear? What will it be like? Will I know anyone? I was grateful to have my youngest sister go with me and met up with two of my SCAR sisters who had their photographs taken on the same day so we knew each other. I didn’t even worry about my attire this time – I’m more concerned with every OTHER day since I haven’t figured out my summer attire with no implants…it is winter in Michigan so I can pull off a scarf every day. Wear what you are comfortable in. You want to be in full on cocktail attire? You will fit in. You are more comfortable in jeans? You will fit in. Somewhere in between? You.will.fit.in. The reality is the photos take center stage and I don’t remember what anyone wears. Often times, I don’t remember what I am wearing until I start being tagged in photos. I actually changed into soccer slides last year because I had ridiculous heels on that I was not making it in. So, perhaps that is my one caution, wear shoes you want to be standing in for four or more hours. We’ll see if I’ve made the right choice this time. I’m not on the wall but I will sign my photo in the book!! I am so excited because a different sister will be joining me. Sharing this with those I love is like sharing one of the most sacred places of my heart. There is a bond with everyone in that room – I hope you are able to come. It is definitely not something you want to miss. I will see you in Birmingham, Alabama!! (I am thankful I can spell this location without issue!!)

4,10,13,17,1,2013,2013-01-17,"[I first met today’s guest blogger at the SCAR Cincinnati Exhibition in 2011. Amber Crouse was one of the about 20 SCAR girls who made that first exhibition outside of the Big Apple so freaking amazing. For me, it was life-changing. One of the things that struck the most beautiful chord, which I can still hear to this day, was the delightful pleasure and deeply felt honor of getting to see the sisterhood of the SCAR girls. They. LOVE. each other. David Jay has said The SCAR Project is really not about breast cancer but about humanity and the scars that unite us all. I find that to be… so beautiful and true… and The SCAR Project Exhibition… such a profound visual aid… because the SCAR girls (portraits) don’t just hang on the wall next to each other… the SCAR girls hang out together. Many of them hadn’t met in person before the Cincinnati exhibition but you would never know that they haven’t been friends forever. Their SCARs have united them and bound them together, much like the stars and stripes wrapped around the girls in the portrait below. A picture is worth a thousand words, but I know many are curious about the story behind the photo of the four women draped in an American flag. I know, for one thing, because I sure as hell was. For another thing, people are always asking me about it. Since I was lucky enough to catch up with Amber at the Birmingham Exhibition I asked her to share the F*ck C*ncer Posse story here. Their story, is to the SCAR girls story, is to the sisterhood of this bitch that is breast cancer. It’s the club you don’t ever want to sign up for, but once you’re in it, you don’t want to leave. It’s a lot like Hotel California I guess;) Beyond all that, the story of the F*ck C*ncer Posse, is to The SCAR Project, is to the humanity that unites us all. Thank you Amber for baring your SCARs and your story.] Kate, Em, Melissa, Amber aka The FC Posse When I was diagnosed with Breast cancer in June of 2006 I didn’t have anyone to talk to about it. I went to The Cancer Support Community to a support group made up of much older women. I was 34 at the time, and they were all well over 50. They were really great and I appreciated their encouragement, but I needed to talk to someone in my shoes. Someone my age. Lucky for me, later that year I met Kate. It was a day I will never forget. I walked into the chemo room and was surprised to see someone my age. She was 35. Without any introduction she looked up at me and said something like, “Dang girl, how big ya going?” I liked her immediately. I explained that my expanders were horrible. One was lower than the other one and you could set a beer on the shelf that was my left expander. I had to wear a very padded bra so you couldn’t see that mess which made me look like I was going for a size D on my size 0-2 frame. We ended up leaving the chemo bar (as my good friend and F*ck C*ncer Posse member Karson calls it) with my husband Steve and her boyfriend and went to have lunch. We started speaking on the phone regularly. We had no idea that we had just started what would become a much larger group of young women with breast cancer in Knoxville, Tennessee. In March of 2007 Kate and I met Melissa at a retreat for Breast Cancer survivors at one of our local hospitals. She had a hippie, music loving vibe to her and I knew we would be fast friends. Her nickname is Giggles. How can you not love a giggler? We started going to shows together and I took her to Bonnaroo while we were both still in treatment. Quite an adventure and endurance challenge. She is a dancing machine and so much fun to be around. We chat almost daily online and see each other regularly. We act a lot like sisters. Not long after we met Melissa we met yet another Melissa, or Em, as we call her now. Both the Melissas are geologists. They both had friends volunteering in Africa who kept talking about a Melissa in Knoxville with breast cancer. They thought it was the same person but turns out it was two people with parallel lives. They arranged to have beers and catch a concert at a local bar. I met up with them and we talked, laughed, and danced our butts off. These days Em’s off teaching and finishing up her PhD in Oregon. We miss her a lot, but she came to visit recently, and we all got to ring in the new year with her. Of course it was a blast having the whole FC Posse together again. Karson was next to be added to our Posse and our name derived from something her husband said. He was telling someone that he couldn’t or shouldn’t do something because his wife’s cancer posse would kick his ass. I’m sure it was something funny. Jason is a great guy and I wish I could remember what it was. We always said Fuck Cancer and so The Fuck Cancer Posse was born. Karson is now in the IV club, which means that she has stage IV metastatic breast cancer. Karson is an awesomely sweet, kind, and gentle soul. She’s our girl and we all love her! Melissa, Em, Karson, Kate, Amber New Years Eve 2008 Melissa had read the call for SCAR models on the Young Survivor Coalition page that David had posted. She contacted him and asked if we could do a group shot and he said yes. There were supposed to be 6 of us: Kate, Em, Melissa, Me, plus a couple more FC Posse girls: Karson and Brynn, who couldn’t make the trip to NYC for the photo shoot. Two days before the 2008 election, we were in his studio taking our shirts off. David had the idea to drape us in the American flag. Three of us were not very keen on the idea for different reasons. But then he explained that we were on the eve of a very big election and he was hoping there could be a chance for universal health care. “Framing” our picture in that context, he said he wanted to show that here are these 4 women under 35 (2 under 30) in the greatest country in the world but there is no guaranteed health coverage for them. So we did it. And it is beautiful. (Thank you, David.) I’m so proud to be a part of it and to have these great women for friends. Steve and I traveled to Birmingham, Alabama last week for the opening of The SCAR Project and The Alabama Project: The Civil Rights of Health Care at UAB’s Visual Arts Gallery. I was happy to meet new SCAR/BAMA sisters, and to see Vanessa, our SCAR sister that is in hospice care. Please check out The Live Sincerely Project and read Vanessa’s story, then take the pledge with The FC Posse to Live Sincerely. I wish David’s wish had already come true and that we already had universal health care in place now. Strides are being made to try to get more coverage to more people in this country, but it is still not enough. To see these VERY young women struggling to get adequate care is infuriating. They deserve better. We all deserve better! Amber, her SCAR/BAMA sisters, and David Jay at The SCAR/BAMA Exhibition We met Brigid almost 3 years ago when she joined The FC Posse. We became really good friends and she was my date for the SCAR Cincinnati opening. She has since become our SCAR sister as well. Brigid is sweet, lovely, a good listener, and a kick ass clothing designer. The clothing line Brigid makes, from tires, is as badass as her SCAR portrait. (But that’s another story for another day.) No one really wants to join our Posse because you have to have cancer to be in it. But if you’ve got cancer, the F*ck C*ncer Posse is the group to be in. We’re all willing to chat with newly diagnosed ladies or gents, cook a meal or more for someone having surgery, give a ride to chemo or a shoulder to cry on. We raise funds and we throw parties. We do have “honorary memberships” for loved ones and caregivers. There are so many more great ladies in Knoxville (and beyond) that are part of our FC Posse like Sarah, Julie, Kristi, Brynn, our dearly departed friend Melissa who was our 6th Posse member, and there are many more… you know who you are. The FC Posse is always here for each other. The FC Posse has got each other’s backs. Click HERE to join the F*ck C*ncer Posse on Facebook. Sincerely, Amber and the F*ck C*ncer Posse (Brigid, Amber, Karson, Sarah, Shannon, Kate, Julie, Melissa)",0,1,0.24079642579642577
6,10,15,8,2,2013,2013-02-08,"[Today’s guest blogger is no stranger to The SCAR Blog. When Facebook removed some of the SCAR images this time last year, Sara wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg on her BLOG which I cross-posted here, with her permission. When quite a few of the SCAR girls were making preparations to head south for The SCAR BAMA exhibition, Sara wrote about it on her blog and once again I snagged it for reprint HERE (again, with her permission) because the SCAR sisterhood, which her article provides a lovely glimpse into, is one of the many beautiful things that has evolved from David Jay’s The SCAR Project Exhibit that many might be unaware of. When Sara got back from The SCAR BAMA exhibition, she wrote a beautiful recap on her blog, which of course also landed HERE, because she’s a generous soul like that, not to mention a dear friend. At which point I played both those cards in the latter part of the previous sentence and told her I thought with 3 SCAR blogs under her belt it was probs time for her to share her story. Of course, she did. And here it is. Thank you, Sara, love!] by Sara Bartosiewicz-Hamilton 12/12/12…I call it my lucky day…the day my life started over. I had no idea how true this would be. Leading up to the 12th day of the 12th month of the 12th year, I was filled with anxiety, ready to have it over…at the same time, I wondered if I was sure. I kept telling myself, if ever I think I’m not ready, I’ll pull the plug…I still showed up. I started tearing up as the nurse prepped me for the surgery. She asked if I was okay.Yeah. She asked if I was sure I wanted to do this. Yeah. She said, it doesn’t make it any easier, does it? And that’s exactly what it was…I knew in my heart and my head it needed to be done…but knowing it, believing it, didn’t make it easier. Much like the beginning of this journey. I was tested for a gene mutation in the fall of 2006. I knew I had a 50/50 chance of having the mutation…my spirit was prepared to hear I was positive. And I was. I was told I had the BRCA2 mutation and, through tears, I responded by asking the genetic counselor to set me up with what came next. She was confused. I was only 29, surely I could wait, surely I didn’t need to do anything until I was 40. Genetic testing was not new but it was not common yet either…I was the youngest person she had tested. I knew what I needed to do. I wanted to have a mastectomy. Take out the tissue that had an 85% chance of turning on me. Get it out, let me live my life. Let me give up this fear. Fear. Our family tree of cancer explains my fear. In my mind, it was a matter of when, never a matter of if. I was surprised by some of the backlash I received from my choice to have a prophylactic mastectomy. I was naive. I was young. I didn’t realize there was a lot of fear behind that anger…sometimes, guilt. I couldn’t handle it so I shut myself away. I tried to find someone, anyone on the internet. My oncological surgeon told me she knew there were other young women choosing to have PBMs…I just couldn’t find any. I was isolated. Friends closest to me told me I shouldn’t do it if I couldn’t be happy. Happy? Was that what I was supposed to feel? I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to be happy about. This wasn’t a boob job. This was the removal of my body parts…my tissue ripped out of my body. And replaced…a plastic mound shoved under my muscle. A plastic mound that would grow over time as I was injected with more fluid, that would continue shoving my muscle around. And all of this to evade cancer…that may eventually come for me anyways. Sara (29) and her daughter Ms P one week after her prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in Jan. 20007 A girl found me on MySpace. She was the one who told me about the SCAR Project and she asked if I wanted to meet her and a couple other girls in NYC to be photographed. I looked up the website and was speechless. I was looking at young women…I was looking at me. I immediately reached out to David Jay: David~ I would like to be involved…I have never had breast cancer but have the BRCA2 gene (mutation). I had a prophylactic mastectomy at 29 because the gene (mutation) gave me an 85% chance of getting breast cancer. I understand your project is for women who have fought breast cancer but I thought I would volunteer in case you could use me as well. Regardless, I look forward to seeing the finished project. When I was getting ready for my surgery, I was desperately searching for what I would look like afterwords. I couldn’t find pictures of young women…this is powerful. Thank you.” I was so excited (and terrified at the same time) when David wrote back and asked me to come. I wanted to participate because I wanted there to be a photo. I wanted the next 29 year old to be able to find my photo and be able to find the courage to have a PBM…to know she was going to be okay. I was terrified because I was going to be photographed. Because there would be a photo of me…there was going to be a photograph of my scars. There was going to be a photograph documenting myimperfection… It didn’t help when I received an email that it may be best to wait. When I asked why, I was told he was receiving emails and he wasn’t sure what to think. I was devastated. And then I was enraged. I received a copy of the email because my sister went to bat for me and was sent a copy of the email: Please re consider the shooting of Sara… She is Not appropriate for this project. she NEVER Had cancer. She only took off her breasts as prevention!!! Everyone in her friend circle and family knows that she is not stable to do this!!!! She does things like this for attention. Who??? Has a DOUBLE MASTECTOMY at age 30 when NO cancer is present??? Someone who is not STABLE. Her mother has NEVER had cancer. Her GRANDMOTHER has NEVER had cancer. This is not the same as your other candidates. PLEASE DO NOT encourage her behavior… Now. I say this with love but as you can understand MANY of us are tired of her charades. And having her half naked in a magazine for us all to explain to people who are AWARE that she NEVER had cancer in the first place. It makes a mockery of those women who have actually almost lost their lives.” It was obvious to me this was not someone closest to me – my grandma did, in fact, have cancer, she had died of cancer. On the flip side, to be honest, I think it hurt so much because I wondered myself. Am I the only one who goes through a double mastectomy at 29 (ahem, NOT 30) without there being cancer present? As I tried to explain the untruth throughout the email, I expressed that I had been wrestling with guilt. Guilt that my choice was done out of fear…guilt that I was a sissy because I was too afraid to get cancer. When I finally made it out to NYC, I had a lot on my mind. I had also received emails from this same person spewing ugly things. At that time in my life, I was unable to recognize that sometimes people are ugly because of what is inside of them…and it has nothing to do with me. I was unable to detach from their words, unable not to internalize them. While it didn’t stop me from going, it made me pause. Was I doing the right thing? I was the last girl to be shot that day. I arrived after everyone was done being photographed (read: dressed). I sat down and had my make-up and hair done and then it was time. The point at which I was taking off my shirt, it seemed like a really crazy idea. Other than my doctors, my hubby was the only one who had seen the scars and he saw them with the security of a dark room and, even then, I did what I could to hide them. I was asked beforehand to bring something that had meaning or relevance to my shoot. I brought a charm with a picture of my littles on it and I also brought a photo of my mom and two of her sisters. I had something which explained without words the reason for my prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and I had something to explain why I would choose this. David went with the photo of my mom and two of her sisters. I’m so thankful he did – for all of time, my photo explains the family ties and the multiple generations our mutation has affected. Sara’s SCAR Portrait taken in Dec. 2007, about a year after her PBM Something happened at my photo shoot. Something I was not even aware of yet. I found a place where I belonged. A place of acceptance. A place of understanding. A place of love. I am forever thankful for my first SCAR sisters. They helped me embrace that my story was valid…they helped me see I was accepted into their “club” without having cancer. They helped pull me back on my feet when I didn’t even realize I was floundering. And they helped me grow taller that day. They were impressed by my courage and strength. I didn’t believe them quite yet but I held onto them, hoping they were right. Fast forward a few years. It seemed surreal as I sat across from someone I called my best friend and heard similar words of ugliness being flung at me. Ironically, it was my five year “boobiversary” – five years after my mastectomy and I was being assaulted with words. Self-mutilator. In need of a therapist, not a surgeon. I had just disclosed I was planning on removing my implants. It was something I had been quietly considering for a while. I had not talked about it with many people: hubby, my plastic surgeon and with one of my SCAR sisters at the Cincinnati exhibit. I was having daily discomfort and pain and was hopeful that having my implants extracted would help relieve this. I was at the point of being ready to schedule the surgery and wanted the moral support of my friend…my “best” friend. I was caught off guard. The me who showed up for my PBM would have allowed this assault to continue until completion…the me who spent the past couple years embracing my new reality was strong enough to say stop…strong enough to walk away. Unfortunately, not before internalizing some of the accusations. I delayed my extraction for another year. I lived with the discomfort and pain as I searched my soul. I couldn’t deny what I was feeling but was I sure having my implants removed was the right choice? I was back in Cincinnati when I had the courage to say it was time. I came home and the first conversation hubby and I had was that I wanted to schedule the extraction. It seemed like more than coincidence, perhaps a sign from the universe, when I was opening the mail immediately after our conversation and I opened lab results from my doctor confirming an autoimmune disease. When I had my pre-surgery appointment with my plastic surgeon, it was both amusing and sad to hear my plastic surgeon ask me what had taken so long. He told me he could tell this was the right choice for me…over a year before. Fast forward to 12/12/12. My life truly did start over. When I woke up from surgery, the discomfort was gone. As my body healed, so did my spirit. I noticed I started looking at myself in the mirror without the little black box to censor what I was seeing. I realized I was the most comfortable I had been in my own body since my mastectomy. I found myself forgetting about the extraction and am no longer reminded daily of my surgeries, my BRCA mutation, or my lingering fear cancer will find me. Life started over, no longer hindered by the past. I have been incredibly blessed – I always had someone in my corner. And, as my journey progressed, that corner became fuller and fuller. I choose to include the pain and judgment of the past because it is, unfortunately, what many women in my shoes continue to hear. However, while those hurtful words have no power over me, they give me the ability to reach out to someone else and say, I understand. I heard that too. I am hopeful that sharing will also help those who would place judgment to step back and recognize, it’s okay if you would never make the choices I made but it doesn’t give you the right to try to say you could live my life better than me. When I look back, I remember vividly the isolation I felt before my prophylactic mastectomy and again, feeling in the extreme minority as I was considering my extraction. I don’t ever want any woman to be completely alone. I recently started a Facebook group with my fellow SCAR sister Barbie – it’s called Flat & Fabulous. We are actively on the hunt for our fellow sisters who have had a mastectomy and, for one reason or another, do not have reconstruction. It has been both validating and heart breaking as I get emails from a stranger telling me she never knew there was someone else like her. Our page offers support, encouragement, and LOTS of laugh as we all go forward with living our new reality. I recently wrote about The SCAR Project Exhibition in Birmingham and Joules texted me to ask if I would share my article here on The SCAR Project blog. About five minutes after she told me it was up and asked me to proof it, I received another text that said now that I’d written for the blog THREE times, but had yet to share my own SCAR story… “it’s time.” So, this is my story. It spans over my lifetime. It starts at my mastectomy. And again at my extraction. I am incredibly thankful for the lessons I’ve learned along the way about love, friendships, life, and what is truly important. Trying my best to Live Sincerely.every.single.day.

7,10,16,7,7,2013,2013-07-07,"Guest Post by Lauren Culpepper [Lauren is the production manager for The SCAR Project, David Jay’s right hand, my SCAR Project sidekick, not to mention, the most lovely soul to work with.] Since The SCAR Project began six years ago, David Jay created a Facebook page for the project. What began as a small page of a few supporters has now become a thriving group supported by over 33,000. David has used Facebook as an immediate way of communicating directly and effectively as he continues his work with The SCAR Project. For years Facebook has randomly and periodically taken down images and banned David’s personal account which prevents him from posting. It has been an unbelievably frustrating challenge. Every time this has occurred, there is no one at Facebook to contact in order to gain clarity on the image removal or ban. This has turned Facebook into a looming “big brother” for The SCAR Project, not knowing when it will strike again. This time, however, a woman reached out via Twitter. Scorchy Barrington, currently stage IV and undergoing treatment, created a petition at Change.org on behalf of David and The SCAR Project that created a massive ripple effect with over 20,000 signatures. Two days after the petition was posted, Change.org got behind the petition, Facebook’s VP of global policy requested to speak to Susan and David, and a conference call was set up with Susan, David, Facebook, and Change.org. It was an extremely beneficial opportunity to listen to one another and have a chance to communicate directly. The following week, Change.org, Susan, Facebook and David exchanged emails editing what would become the new policy that you now see on Facebook’s policy page. While in many ways the new policy is a huge victory for breast cancer survivors, whether or not Facebook will continue to allow certain images to be posted on The SCAR Project’s page remains to be seen. The new policy is certainly improved, but also leaves plenty of room for Facebook to decide what images are allowed and what images are considered a violation. And, according to the new policy, The SCAR Project images previously taken down remain to be a violation. We continue to await the decision by Facebook as to whether or not they will re-post the images (including the hundreds of comments that accompany them) that were previously removed. It has now been over a month and we have yet to see those images restored to the Facebook page. But the truth is that nothing has really changed at Facebook. In fact, the issue has nothing to do with breast cancer at all. Facebook never had any issues with mastectomies from the beginning. Mastectomies are not the problem. Nipples are. But not men’s nipples. Only women’s. Somewhere buried within the history of America’s societal evolution (or lack thereof), the female nipple became a body part to be hidden and ashamed of. The female nipple has and continues to violate every media policy in our country, but no one will admit to that fact. David Jay brought up the issue repeatedly while in discussions with Facebook, asking them to at least clarify that it was the female nipple that was in violation. Silence. No one wants to talk about it, yet everyone wants to abide by the unspoken “rule”: The female nipple is illegal in America. And now, as we enter the world of breast cancer treatment (where we have everything from no breasts, breasts but no nipples, one breast with one nipple, breasts with reconstructed or tattooed nipples) we enter into a gray area that perpetuates the nipple conundrum. And the recent issue with Facebook’s policies has once again shined the limelight on the elephant in the room, only for the issue to be skirted around and avoided. How many more generations will continue to accept this view of the female body? With everyone’s recent finger-pointing at Facebook’s lack of clear policies regarding discriminatory, hateful, sexist, bigoted and misogynistic posts, the problem lies much deeper. And it is buried underneath decades of a misconstrued view of what a woman and her body represents.

Now, especially in light of the recent Facebook controversy over SCAR images, and of upcoming exhibition news, I’ve asked my flat and fabulous SCAR sister Toni G. to share her SCAR story. Here is the first of two parts.] Guest Post by SCAR girl Toni G. I was sitting in a tent at Zion National Park when I got the news. The voice of the surgeon who had biopsied a mass in my breast the week before came through my cell phone: “We need to talk”. My heart sank. I had breast cancer. I was 28 years old. I’d already planned out my vacation to Utah for the spring of 2007 to celebrate passing the doctoral candidacy exam—a feat that would allow me to continue pursuing my Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. But experiments didn’t cooperate, and I’d had to postpone the exam and take my “celebratory” vacation before I even answered one question. And now this woman was on the phone saying words horribly foreign to me. ER+/PR-/Her2-. Grade 2. BRCA1/2-. Two IDC tumors measuring 3 and 5 cm. More unfamiliar terms followed as she proceeded to tell me the course of treatment. I sat in silence while she described, in what seemed like one breath, oncologists, mastectomy, chemotherapy. When she spoke the word radiation I finally lost it. My space-time continuum had just been warped by the gravity of cancer. She wanted me to see an oncologist that day, but I was 1500 miles from home and a week away from my return flight. I told her I couldn’t that day. Or the next few. I had rented canyoneering equipment for the day and had miles of hiking to look forward to. I would be home in a week. I didn’t call my family. I couldn’t bear to tell them the heaviest news of my life over the phone. The one phone call I did make was to the chair of my committee. My candidacy exam would have to be further postponed. It turns out, indefinitely—but that’s another blog. The months following diagnosis were surreal. I’d become so used to people telling me that 20-somethings don’t get breast cancer that I found it hard to believe I actually did. When I was 20, I found a lump in my breast. My surgeon insisted it was a cyst. No tests? No biopsies? Nope. When the pathology came back benign, I sensed an “I told you so.” He told me that even if I discovered more cysts in the future, I wouldn’t have to have them removed. “They’re normal,” he said. “They’re normal,” I thought eight years later as I stood naked in front of the mirror slowly tilting my head and squinting. My left nipple looked odd and had gone flat. My gynecologist thought the scar tissue from my cyst removal was causing it. She never mentioned the words breast cancer. Over the next few months I began to feel a mass in the same breast. I called my gynecologist’s office again and was told to call back in six months to follow up. I convinced myself it was just another one of those normal cysts. So I didn’t worry—for seven long months. By then, the two masses in my breast were causing sharp shooting pains across my chest. The (finally) worried gynecologist ordered a biopsy. And then I was in Utah, sitting in a tent… When I did finally go home and called a family meeting, Dad was giddy. “You’re getting married!?” No, Dad. “You’re having a baby!?” No, that’s not it either. It made the truth more crushing. My oncologist started me on chemotherapy immediately because the tumors were so large. He ordered a CT scan that came back with abnormal spots in my femur and four places in my spine. After a follow up PET-CT scan, I received a second blow. The spots were metastasized breast cancer. I was now stage four. I wasn’t concerned at first. My ignorance of metastatic breast cancer shielded me. But after a week of reading through scientific literature, I found myself shutting my laptop every night in tears, unable to handle any more statistics. Based on my research, I knew I only had a 25 percent chance of being alive in five years. My oncologist said nothing had changed—not our treatment strategy or my life expectancy. I knew then I had to change oncologists. My life depended on it. I found my second oncologist at MD Anderson. She cited current literature and was willing to be as aggressive as I wanted with my treatments. She understood my drive to do absolutely everything I could to get rid of the beast that was trying to pull me down. “Absolutely everything” turned out to be the hardest experiment of my life. Seven months of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy, a clinical trial with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant, and six weeks of skin-scorching radiation to top it off. It worked. I was declared to have “no evidence of disease”! Just one week after I finished my treatment, I hiked to the top of the Continental Divide in Colorado. After hours of plodding through the snow and a chance encounter with a majestic mountain goat, I found myself sitting at the top of the mountain. Bald and burned and brave. I had defied gravity. I had defied cancer!

As she is a science teacher, Part I dealt with the Gravity of cancer. Part II is likewise aptly titled Force.] Guest Post by SCAR girl Toni G. After being diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 28 years old, I found my life moving down a new path, even as the geography of my body was being redefined. My dream of being a scientist and having my own lab was no longer a priority like it was in my before cancer days. Being alive, and enjoying life, was. Being a positive force despite the cancer, was too. In the days and weeks that followed my diagnosis I felt lost. There was an abundance of breast cancer information out there but only a fraction of it was relevant to my situation. I tried to find information from other twenty-somethings fighting cancer while still finishing their degrees. And still dating. And without children. Cancer was forcing me to make some of the most difficult decisions of my life. Sifting through the mountains of information to find the right answers for me felt isolating, was time consuming and emotionally exhausting: Erosion. One decision was what to do with the breasts that were trying to kill me. I knew without a doubt they had to go, but what would I put in their place? After meeting with a plastic surgeon I knew my reconstruction options on paper, but one size doesnʼt fit all. At the time, I knew I wanted breasts, but I couldnʼt picture what my new breasts would, or could, look like. Expanders? Implants? With or without transplanted belly/back/butt tissue? Another twelve inches of scars on my body? Tattooed nipples? I tried to find pictures online to help make this decision, but there were surprisingly few resources available showing real post-mastectomy pictures. Especially in younger women. One day on the Komen message board a photographer named David Jay posted that he was looking for young breast cancer survivors to participate in “The S.C.A.R. Project: Surviving Cancer, Absolute Reality”. After an inquiry he told me he wanted to portray through photography the cancer experience by showing the visible scars that are symbolic for so many women. He wanted to show the world exactly what I had been looking for. I immediately knew I had to be a part of this unique awareness project. To help other young women who are feeling lost, facing the same reality. To be a positive force. David and I decided to do a series of portraits….before and after my bilateral mastectomy as well as after reconstruction. In 2007 I flew to New York City with my sister just months before my surgery to do the “before” shot. A year later, after my double mastectomy I flew back to NYC with my father and took the “after surgery” shot. This picture shows my reality: burned from radiation, scars where my breasts used to be and those million dollar chemo curls. These are a few of the symbols in my SCAR portrait. And my sheer determination. Part of my cancer battle plan involved a clinical trial where I had high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. With my immune system wiped out I was told reconstruction was going to have to wait a year due to a high risk of infection. A year of contemplating (and stressing over) reconstruction options passed. Then, in the short window of opportunity I had to have the reconstruction surgery, I was offered a chance to visit Peace Corps friends in Mozambique. Reconstruction was going to have to wait some more; I chose Mozambique. Another year went by and I was still breastless. But by then I knew of other survivors, struggling with pain, necrosis, rejection, infection and many other complications that go along with trying to rebuild a part of your body from unnatural parts. The idea that reconstruction was the only way to go was starting to fade. The SCAR Project evolved and in October 2010 I returned to NYC with all four of my siblings to attend the SCAR Project exhibition. I remember walking up to the gallery and seeing the portraits that had become so familiar to me; I’d only looked at them a million times before that night. I felt an instant bond with my SCAR sisters. We shared our stories. We all had similar questions about life after cancer and it was comforting to put bits and pieces of the puzzle together. Especially since we were assembling it without knowing what the final picture looked like. I didn’t know at the time the impact The SCAR Project would have on me, let alone the cancer community and beyond. I hoped it would change the way people viewed the reality of breast cancer. I hoped it would give women strength to know there is life after cancer, even if it is filled with jagged scars and a valley of doubt. I wanted to be one of those pictures that women could look at and relate. I wanted to be an answer that someone else was looking for. My hopes for the SCAR Project continue to come true as the exhibit travels, and more and more people find out about it and are inspired by it. It is the powerful force I hoped it would be. And I am so proud to be a part of it. In addition to NYC I’ve also attended the Cincinnati and Birmingham exhibitions. I’m thrilled it’s coming to Houston this October. Even more thrilled that MD Anderson, the place that played an instrumental role in saving my life, is hosting the opening night. As far as that “after reconstruction” shot David and I were going to do? Well, I canʼt pinpoint the moment I made the decision not to have reconstruction, but it happened sometime in those years of waiting to have it. It’s such a paradigm shift to have been so gradual. I don’t think I ever really thought of no reconstruction as an option. Our society is infatuated with breasts. “Every man’s a breast man” and 1 woman = 2 breasts…not one or none. My SCAR sisters have shown me, both directly and indirectly, that I donʼt have to have reconstruction. They encourage me to embrace the new me and to live flat and fabulous like countless other women. And two of my lovely SCAR sisters, Sara and Barbie, have started a Flat & Fabulous Facebook support group for women who’ve chosen against having reconstruction. I continue to find comfort in communicating with women who have walked in my shoes. That finding other women who have walked in similar shoes was so very difficult is the very reason the world needs The SCAR Project. I needed the SCAR Project. And I know I’m not alone.",0,1,0.15809676291635055

I had a unique experience a few months back, when MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Dr. Oliver Bogler asked me to review the work of New York photographer David Jay. I replied that MD Anderson doesn’t have a rotating gallery space but that the work HAD to be brought to Houston. Hands down, The SCAR Project was the most incredible work I had ever seen! I have always been drawn to figurative black and white photography—it draws me in in a way that no other genre ever does. David’s work has the raw brutality of Diane Arbus’ work but it envelops the viewer in a passion of love, respect, and admiration. Instead of detachment and alienation that viewers can feel about Arbus’ work, these pieces bring out every shred of humanity in the viewer who wants to reach out to each of the subjects and say, “You are beautiful….” Bringing the work to Houston became a personal mission. My first thought was that Gremillion Gallery had the perfect exhibition space for the large format works. I also knew that the gallery has been incredibly generous in lending its space to various charitable events over the years. It was a quick and emphatic yes when I asked Ron Gremillion and Chris Skidmore if they were interested. It must have been serendipity but as soon as there was a fabulous exhibition space, there was also funding to bring the show to Houston! Pink Ribbons Project, a breast cancer survivor non-profit organization, generously agreed to underwrite the hard costs of the exhibit. The show premieres at a private gala event this October 17, and runs through October 28th. There are numerous public-service events planned around the exhibit including lectures by both the artist and various breast health experts. Click HERE for the exhibit schedule and ticket information. The message of the work is undeniable: David Jay has captured the harrowing beauty, dignity, courage and strength of young women dealing, living, and thriving after breast cancer surgery. Both his passion and compassion are piercingly apparent to the viewer.",0,1,0.16846642586438504

The cool thing about this portrait, is that it was actually taken during the Cincinnati exhibition, in one of the gallery, which we walled off and turned into a photo shoot area.] Guest Post by Jocelyn Whitfield Banks This blog is in tribute to The Scar Project and to that frightening, but awe-inspiring moment when I took off my clothes for fashion photographer David Jay, allowing him to photograph my scars from mulitple battles with breast cancer. In 2002 a diagnosis of an aggressive breast cancer prompted the decision for a bilateral mastectomy just 30 days after my 25th birthday had come and gone. After a second diagnosis, seven reconstruction surgeries later, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital stays I am in awe of the nearly 70 inches of scars running across my trunk, my abdomen, my hips, and my new breasts. The process at times has been exhausting, overwhelming and just plain tough. At other times it has been exhilarating, and encouraging to see the inner-strength that I have as I “dig deep” for the determination to beat cancer and not let it beat me. Some would believe that all of those post-mastectomy scars might make me “damaged goods” but I’m a firm believer that those scars are an outward and physical sign from my body that says “I may be injured, but look at me. I am healing”… Where there are scars and cuts and stitching, there is inevitably healing going on in the body. The initial trauma is over, the wounds have scabbed over, and the production of collagen to repair all of these incisions is hard at work making the parts of the body that have been cut, moved, and stitched back together heal and find their new norm in both form and function. Yes, that dark railroad of lines running across me say to me that my body is healing and we’re going to be OK… Baring my Scars for all of the world to see was the single greatest indicator for me that I was healing on the inside too. In the pictures of all of these beautiful women, their scars show the physical trauma they each have endured, but it is The Scar Project that captures and displays to the world, the emotional trauma inflicted by breast cancer. The courage, the strength and the determination required to fight this disease are one thing, but the courage to go forth and expose both your vulnerabilities and your triumphs to complete strangers are what makes The Scar Project images so moving, so riveting, and so awe-inspiring. That moment when I proudly shared my scars to show the world that “Breast Cancer is Not a Pink Ribbon”… Well that was the moment I realized that Where There Are Scars… There is also Incredible Healing happening not only on the outside, but all over the inside too. Our children and our loved ones need an outlet for healing too. That’s why I’m so proud to be part of a nationwide effort to support families fighting breast cancer too.

13,10,21,1,3,2014,2014-03-01,"[Today’s guest post is written by Debi Memmolo, breast cancer survivor and friend of David Jay, in response to the most recent removal of SCAR images from Facebook.] Just after my 38th birthday, I had the life-changing pleasure of attending an exhibit of The SCAR Project, a series of large-scale portraits of young women confronting breast cancer, shot by fashion photographer David Jay. I saw myself in each of these women. I saw, in real life, the ravages of this disease. I saw beauty. I walked away with an invaluable gift: I do not need breasts to be beautiful. A few months later, I too had my breasts removed to fight the cancer that was growing inside me. Yes, I had them “reconstructed,” but what remains on my chest are two, uneven mounds covered in taut skin and some scars. As it turns out, this now gives me the legal right to walk down the streets of New York City bare chested. (Nudity, it turns out, is defined as exposure of a woman’s nipple.) Well, aren’t I lucky? This week Facebook removed the SCAR Project’s photographs, posted to honor one of the SCAR girls in light of her recent passing, February 23. Hundreds of followers of The SCAR Project wrote beautiful messages upon seeing these photographs (while they were still up) and hearing the news of her death. And then, without warning (or apparently a deep thought), Facebook took them all down and locked David Jay out of his own page. Why? Because nipples are improper nudity on Facebook and a hint of one of Vanessa’s nipples was in one of the images. With some protest, some (not all) of the images were replaced. David was still denied access. I may have left this alone, but then I learned this was not the first time Facebook acted this way. In fact, it has happened several times. In mid-2013, there was a media frenzy regarding Facebook’s policies and its impact on The SCAR Project and young women with breast cancer. Facebook reversed itself then too. Nothing really changed though. It is, perhaps, not fair to hold Facebook accountable for this action. I do not think that its policies are aimed at maligning the goodwill served by such things as The SCAR Project. This is clearly a response to something larger in our society – the female nipple and its tie to sexuality. Innumerable people have asked me why I have not decided to have nipple reconstruction. (The “reconstruction” is performed either by twisting and stitching skin or getting a tattoo of a nipple). I am truly dumbfounded by this question. My nipples served their purpose: I had the immense fortune of nursing two children with them. Now, this disease has taken my fertility and the utility of a nipple. And I do not need nipples anymore. While nursing, my real nipples were exposed in some of the finest restaurants, from coast to coast. They also were out on airplanes, on the side of the road and, in moving vehicles. No one seemed aroused or stimulated by the sight of a woman using her breast for its intended purpose, feeding her young. The right to breast feed in public has seen its day in the media, but those battles, too, did not really get to the point. Why are we so fixated on the female nipple? And why is it so different from that of the male? We are living in modern times, with modern sensibilities. This is not the Victorian Era. Why are we still struggling to acknowledge that exposure of a female nipple can, perhaps, be no less pornographic than the exposure of a man’s? Why are we still objectifying body parts? A prosthetic nipple will make me no more or less a woman than I already am. Despite my SCARs [Surviving Cancer.] [Absolute Reality.] I am, after all, still a woman.

I love to sit with my thoughts, and plan and play, and let my mind wander into nothingness. The future, I just love dreaming about the future. Don’t get me wrong I think I can live in the now and I understand the importance of that “power of now” mind control, but daydreaming is what I do best. I’m happy there. Tuesday 7th November 2006 dreaming ceased. My world stood still and everything kept spinning around me. Reality was my only mind wander. Dark, cruel, harsh, messy, day-by-day, chemo-to-chemo, reality. I’d noticed a lump, like a pea under my right arm on my honeymoon in the April. I really didn’t think anything of it. A couple of months past until I made my 1st Doctors appointment. I mean I was only just 24, no family history, and healthy. Cancer just doesn’t happen to this under-the-radar girl. The doctor agreed, “Just a swollen lymph node,” she said. “Cancer feels grisly; yours doesn’t,” she said. “You’re too young,” she said. Hmmph. By October I started noticing my right arm felt strange, tingly, and the lump had increased. I also felt another lump within my breast. Lump at ten o’clock, lump at eleven o’clock; the clock was ticking on this killer boob. Those words “your results have been remarkable” make me giggle now. I don’t know what I thought the doctor was going to announce *Cue trumpet “amazing, remarkable golden nugget found within”. Those words confused me. Huh? ”Cancer cells have been detected.” Hold on, a little clearer for the blonde in the room, so, what you are saying is I. Have. Cancer?? *Cue river of tears. So began this rollercoaster of life with far more twists and turns than I had imagined it would. The previous month, I’d trekked 42kms with my husband and in-laws. I’d just received my wedding album. And I’d resigned one job, to start a new one that would allow me to begin my dream make-up artistry course: *dream-life. But the month in front of me, I’d be having my right breast cut from my body. I’d begin In Vitro Fertilization, in case I became infertile from the six courses of chemo I’d begin. And I’d throw out all my low cut t-shirts *Booo, add wig shopping to the to-do list, and wonder if I will live, or die. I was so scared for the girl who would wake up from the anaesthetic, my first anesthetic. Would she be mad at me for taking her breast? Would she forget and not know what I had done to her until she looked down and saw . . . well, nothing but a scar? It was like another person would be waking up. Would I loose myself, along with my breast? I wasn’t sure. For a while I think I disappeared, became a shadow of myself. I had to control my mind. No future dreams or plans. It felt like a tease to dream of what I felt I wouldn’t reach. Day by day, I just got by, holding on to a glimmer of hope that that dark shadow lurking over my shoulder would dissipate and the sun would shine again. I stumbled across The SCAR Project accidentally. I hadn’t seen the images, only a small piece from David Jay about his project online. Four years post cancer, I wanted to do something meaningful. Something that might give other young women some hope that cancer isn’t always the end. Sometimes it is. But I knew that all I wanted when I was first diagnosed was to see other young women growing older . . . having families . . . living . . . thriving . . . Even though that isn’t always the reality. I never imagined that as I left David’s Bondi studio, a huge wave of empowerment, freedom, and acceptance would come over me. I felt as though I was truly honest for the first time. This is me. I’m imperfect, but I am alive. Immortalized in print, naked from the waist up. These images I now know well, my friends, my SCAR sisters. They often stare back at me from my laptop; they give me strength and inspire me when I need it. They are raw and deep; transparent. They are take-your-breath-away-beautiful & shocking. Young women like me. Like you. These portraits recently graced the walls of the David Jones Elizabeth Street store, Sydney, my home soil. The space was beautiful Circa 1920’s, high ceilings and a soft golden glow pours through the tall arched windows. My breath was literally taken away. I stood staring into the eyes of Darling Jolene, with a lump in my throat and my eyes tingling. So beautiful, painful and honest. I saw Paulina the first of David’s portraits, starring down the camera fiercely; I saw her standing in front of her image, her past. She looks beautiful, fit, and healthy. Paulina standing by her SCAR Portrait at David Jones Gallery in Sydney, Australia. 2014 My husband and I attended the opening night, and I have been back a second time with my mum and sister. To share such a meaningful part of my life, my healing process with them was a feeling I can’t describe. As they walked around with me I shared these women’s stories, past and present, they were in awe of their courage. Some woman are smiling, even laughing, others are starring into your soul, another crying. Some are living on this earth, some have moved to the next world. I have seen these images before and been touched. Heidi standing by Barbie’s SCAR portrait “I am one of these women; yet, standing face to face with them, I ached joy and sadness with every cell of my being.” I look back on 2006 with mixed emotions. I was married, *smiley face. Breast Cancer happened, *sad-angry-confused face. But I feel lucky that I’m starring down the 8 year barrel looking back to what was, having faced the struggles that come with illness, disfigurement, life hurdles, and being a young woman. I never want to meet that C witch again, but l try to take away anything positive I can from this experience—or any tough experience—to learn what I can about myself, and about others. Breast cancer, well, it just was. I feel lucky that I can say that today. I hope I can continue to say that. It just was. It changed much in my life, altered a cruisey path. I am scarred, mostly scars that run flesh deep. But I am here now, living and dreaming. Heidi and her husband Ryan. Trekking down dreams.",0,1,0.11853097463189206
17,10,25,10,1,2016,2016-01-10,"[So. Many. People. ask me about the girl in this breathtakingly beautiful Indian woman SCAR portrait. My girl Sona. I met Sona at The SCAR Project Cincinnati Exhibit in 2011. This was a pretty epic exhibit, with about 20 of the SCAR girls coming to my town. First of all, it was the first time SCAR exhibited outside NYC. Secondly, it was when some kind of superglue bond between the SCAR girls happened. When Sona arrived in Cincy in 2011, we rented a motorized wheelchair for her, as not being able to walk was one of the side effects she was dealing with, from chemo. In 2013, Sona came back to Cincy, this time for our Cincinnati SCAR sister Vanessa Tiemeier’s celebration of life. But this time, she walked off the plane. That’s how they roll, showing up for one another like that. It’s been one of the blessings of my life to witness. Just like my sweet Sona Sunflower.] Guest Post by SCAR Girl Sona Cancer 1.0 (Sona ~ 19 years old.) The first time I had cancer, I never knew. I had not been told those words that I’ve gotten numb to hearing all these years later. I was 19 years old and a freshman at NYU. I had a double major and double minor, which didn’t leave me time for a double mastectomy. I was touching every area of interest in my studies and my lifestyle. MY whole life was ahead of me. Pain in my breasts had led the doctor to find lumps. Three to be exact. I spent Valentine’s Day that year lamenting that I was having three lumpectomies done. Two on the left side, one on the right. “Fibroadenomas,” they said, which begged relief. After all, it “wasn’t” cancer. In those days, they didn’t drop their jaws at things that would be a concern today. What no one told me about was the DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) that I found in my operation report 17 years later when I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer at the age of 36. That’s when I heard the words that stopped me in my tracks. It was as though I had just heard that the field I was running through was filled with landmines. Which it was. Cancer 2.0 (Sona ~ 36 years old. Sai ~ 2 years old.) I was married, the mother of a two-year-old son, and smack in the middle of graduate school when I was finally diagnosed with cancer. 17 years. I had already been through enough (or so I had thought), by then. My plate was full—previous breast surgeries, PTSD from being at Ground Zero on 9/11, congenital Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome that had cost me over a dozen various surgeries and procedures, divorcing my soulmate. For dessert, my left breast got 14 cm of cancer that had spread all the way to the axillary lymph nodes. They called it Stage 3 Luminal B (ER+, PR+, HER2-, Kl67 70%). I had DCIS in the right breast. I was outraged that it hadn’t been caught sooner. Let me backtrack a bit. I had been having trouble for years and it had seemed as though no one was listening to whatever red flags I’d had the courage to wave. Actively nursing, my milk ducts had been getting clogged to the point of having to have them surgically extracted. This is very difficult to do since the nipples don’t have skin over them and therefore cannot be stitched up. It requires pumping and dumping bloody milk for a week as the nipples heal. I had sounded the alarm to my OBGYN and a oncological GYN. No one had said cancer when I was 19, but I had been told to be careful and concerned going forth. My complaints were all brushed aside. Since I had been nursing my son, something I planned to do for 2 years (recommended by WHO), I had been told that once I weaned him, they’d look at it with a mammogram to see what was going on. I didn’t last the two years. Cancer came in kicking and screaming, knocking my door of self-awareness flat off the hinges. I knew something was wrong. I was in excruciating pain for months. Breasts would fill quickly and get engorged and I’d pump a whopping 10 ounces out of each between feedings! My son was a barracuda and nursed strongly. I thought this might be why I hurt so much. I complained of pain all the time but didn’t have anyone take the complaints seriously. I couldn’t so much as lie on my belly—any pressure on the breasts sent sharp pains like needles through the entirety of my double Ds. At this point, I moved from Florida to New Jersey to stay with my mom so I could have help with my child while I tried to find out what was going on. My son was two, non-verbal, not potty trained, and would not feed from anything but my breasts. We would later find out that he had classic autism. My husband was not dealing with stress well. I needed reliable help. It took me six months to be able to see the gynecologist in New Jersey, who then told me not to worry about it. “It’s just connective tissue,” she said. She felt the breasts and was positive it was not cancer and that I did not need a mammogram. On this, my first and last visit to this doctor, I demanded from her a script for a mammogram because NOT ONLY was I in so much pain I could barely handle it, but I was also covered for a baseline at age 35 by my crappy University insurance plan and it would be bad practice for her to deny me a freaking baseline at 36. She consented hesitantly and let it be known that she didn’t care for me getting huffy with her. Thank God for intuition and the pain that cancer brought because I would never have caught it if I had not been assertive. I was adamantly told it was NOT cancer just by the doctor feeling my breasts confidently, even after hearing about the history I had from age 19. This is what still infuriates me. It could have and should have been caught earlier because even young people get cancer. (Which is what The SCAR Project is all about.) An MRI or Ultrasound could have diagnosed it if the doctors had bothered to give me one in Florida. Finally, after scans, biopsies, and much worrying, I heard those words on June 13, 2007: “You have cancer.” I opted for the double mastectomy and the TRAM flap reconstruction. I thought it was a natural choice. I had a radial tire going on and who would say no to having that nipped and tucked for the sake of the cancer and reconstruction? You see, a pedicle TRAM flap is where they carve out your breasts from the skin and then move your abdominal muscle into the flap. You end up with 4 of your 6-pack in your boobs, basically. This is a procedure most doctors will not agree to do bilaterally anymore. You will see why. The surgery took 11.5 hours and involved my surgical oncologist and a plastic surgeon. When it was over, I had blood clots in both my lungs and cancer cells still in the chest wall (which I would find out seven and a half years down the road). The blood clots didn’t kill me but they royally fucked up my reconstruction and I had to have the whole thing redone a year later. I had ten months of open wounds due to the Ehlers Danlos Syndrome the first time around and six months of open wounds after the revision. I spent about 30 months unable to walk without assistance. Immediately after the initial surgery, I had begun six months of chemo and watched my husband relapse into a heroin addiction he had kicked before we had met. I sent him to rehab twice, but when he slit his wrists in our living room while I was out at one of my doctor’s appointments, we parted ways, for all of our sakes and personal battles, and for my son’s safety. The chemo was difficult. I had allergies to two of the three drugs (Adriamycin, Taxol, and Cytoxan) and had to keep stopping treatments here and there due to my counts going off-the-charts low. It took me six months and I didn’t even finish the Taxol. The neuropathy had reached my face and my lips and I was left speaking as though I had been injected with Novocaine. The Neulasta shots were mind numbingly painful. It made my bone marrow swell, creating pressure from within my bones. All of them. Each injection would be followed by three days of not being able to shower due to the pain of mere water on my skin. During this time, I could not be touched by anyone. I had to take medication to facilitate long bouts of sleep. Simply existing, during that phase of the chemo cycle was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I would sit and cry, unable to move. My mother would watch, wanting to hug me but knowing it would only make the pain worse. Nothing brought relief except sleep. I was grateful for my education in Psychology, for it was the miracle of a clever cognitive reframe that got me through this time. I told myself repeatedly (like a mantra) that God was giving me a choice: either I could go through the chemo, or my son would have to. It wasn’t true, of course. It was merely a device that, when used repeatedly, gave me the courage to go get my treatment. Whenever I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, all I had to do was repeat this to myself over and over, and the strength came. There is nothing greater than a Mother’s love. Not even the pain of Neulasta. It’s tools like this that have kept me strong and resilient through the years. I took Coumadin for two years for the pulmonary emboli. It was a constant reminder of that OTHER brush against death. I was already on borrowed time and lucky to be alive. Once dose-dense chemo was done, I started Arimidex hormone therapy, Lupron monthly chemo, and bi-annual infusions of Aredia. I stayed on this regimen for five years. Turns out I should have never stopped it. That regimen was keeping the cancer that was left in me from growing. Chemo saved my life just as much as it messed it up. I still struggle with neuropathy, pain, issues with the mesh implant from the TRAM flap reconstruction, chemobrain and migraines. I still often need assistance to walk. I own a motorized wheelchair and people who know me and are very used to seeing me in it during my roughest times. One of the complications from the TRAM flap procedure was requiring a plastic mesh to be placed in my torso. This proved to be a major annoyance to the point of placing me in a wheelchair or walking with assistance at best. I was like that for five years until the chemo all stopped. It took a year after that to build my strength and I did start walking again. I thought the nightmare was over and I could resume life. It had been a horrible five years. I had tried to reconcile with my husband for the sake of our child, which proved to be a bad decision, for he had never truly kicked his drug habit. I was also to find out later he had inflicted unspeakable physical and mental abuse upon our autistic child. I filed for divorce, got a permanent restraining order and bought a condo on the serene and beautiful Florida Intracoastal waterway. I took the time to focus on my child and give him the life we both needed—stress-free, warm, and loving. I had desperately needed to rebuild my life. I was watching it being done all around me. I had come to know a small sisterhood of other young survivors through my involvement in David Jay’s SCAR Project. This was a healing experience that catapulted me into a network of others just like me who had to survive cancer whilst juggling kids or dating or divorce or grad school or all of the above (as I was). Young adult cancer is not the same thing as your grandmother’s cancer. You’re often the center of the family when you’re young and things fall apart when the center does not hold. Lives are shattered in the wake of cancer. My SCAR sisters were walking this minefield with me and we leaned on each other, sharing all of it: the good and the bad, the lessons, and the funerals. I was doing Reiki, drumming and chanting, and utilizing diet, crystals, oils, herbs, teas, roots, mushrooms, meditations, tarot, massage, and music. I had a whole program of wellness. I was a phoenix rising out of the ashes. I was tickled to have several media folks write articles about my outlook or shoot videos to discuss different things I was doing in recovery (drum circles, dragonboating, etc.). I had become a poster girl for young adults living with cancer. I did get strong enough to walk on my own, become active with cub scouts, start to let my ministry and spiritual aspirations unfold, and even develop a social life in South Florida. I finished my degree, I sang karaoke, I hung out at the kava bar, I camped with scouts, and I had acquired a nanny which freed me up for lots of “me time” for the first time. I even started dating again. The Ehlers-Danlos proved to be a nightmare itself whilst I thought I was NED (no evidence of disease), and I at one point ended up in the wheelchair again a year after I had begun walking on my own. I had torn five different ligaments and tendons the first time I attempted water slides since recovery. This was a hard blow. I had fought to get out of the house and have a social life and it seemed like just months into me finally getting my groove back. BAM! Back to being sedentary at home. I fought to get out and forge a social life for myself, despite the wheels. I’d go sing karaoke since music always made me feel better. I’d go have some kava. Being social and falling in love saved me mentally from falling into a depression over my health. Love went out the door literally however when cancer came back into the picture. To his credit, my boyfriend did try to come back a few days later and repair the relationship, but the decision had already been made. I was moving to New Jersey in the morning to be with my mother. Once again I found myself with someone I could not rely upon. Men who are equipped and willing to embark on a healing journey with their soulmates will forever hold a very special place in my heart because I have spent my life looking for that man. And I end up at my mother’s house every time, dependent upon her to care for my son whilst I buckle up and brace for the fight. Cancer 3.0 (Sona ~ 44. Sai ~ 9) So, just as love walked out the door, cancer came in, took his shoes off, and made himself at home. I was perplexed and angry at first when I heard there was cancer found in a breast that had already been removed. This wasn’t supposed to happen. We get mastectomies SO THAT this doesn’t happen. My oncologist told me with actual tears in his eyes how sorry he was and that there was a less than 1% chance of this happening. It was not common. I was learning that I was pretty much a candidate for all medical weirdness, anomalies, rare adverse effects, and flat out flukes of medical science. This time around (what I call Cancer 3.0), I had my ovaries removed along with the cancer. It was clear that the hormones were fuel to my tumor. Recovery from this went far better than the previous surgeries. Protocols have also evolved over the last eight years. I have even received the radiation I should have gotten seven years ago. They are learning that in young people, cancer is more aggressive. We are more at risk for recurrence and metastasis. I’ve seen it firsthand. I’ve buried a few of my SCAR Sisters. I have been living sincerely. I have been using diet, energy work, crystals, oils, natural medicine, meditation, and comedy, adjunctively with surgery and radiation. Cancer has brought many interesting practices into my life: drum circles, Reiki, crystal singing bowls, dragonboating, Jin Shin Jyutsu, Tai Chi, crystals, mantras, Ayahuasca, labyrinths, somatron chairs, play therapy and sand trays, and much more. I even play video games for Cancer 3.0 with storylines involving battling cancer cells. But I am NOT the happy poster child this time. I repressed my anger during Cancer 2.0 and this time I am going to express the full gamut of emotions. None of that “oh, just think positive” shit. Positive thinking and visualizations are awesome and I use them regularly as tools. But growling, releasing anger, and being honest about my experience (no matter what YOU may think of my outbursts) is what needs to be done so that I DON’T suppress it and let it fester below the surface planting seeds for another outbreak. Most importantly is humor. I have learned how to incorporate my twisted humor and have been known to walk around in shirts that say things like: “Cancer— only the pretty people have it.” My handle is “Chemo Kardashian.” I laugh at everything I can think of to laugh at, including myself. People so often comment on how good I look despite what I’ve endured. I’ve used the pop culture reference to the Kardashians to poke fun at the emphasis people put on looks over health. I’m STILL in the middle of a brutal divorce. Seven years post-separation and I am still mid-litigation! My soon-to-be-ex-husband even petitioned the court to prohibit me from treating my cancer out of state (going so far as to ask for my son to be remanded into foster care until I am better, which thankfully was recognized by the judge as a shitty idea). I deal with this and focus on rest and treatments. Upon my return to Florida, I was slapped with litigation involving custody issues due to going out of state for treatment. Because of the costs of attorneys, and only having disability income to survive on, I have yet to have follow up scans done. My funds have gone to fighting the litigation and defending my son’s safety. I never thought I’d come across something that cancer had to take a back seat to. Hopefully soon this litigation will end and I can focus on my health. Plus with all I’ve gone through, I want to spend some time enjoying and relishing life. I’m waiting to exhale though, and hoping that rest and true convalescence is just around the corner.",0,1,0.07412475459685762
18,10,3,4,5,2012,2012-05-04,"[It humbles me and is my deeply felt honor to defer this post to my friend/survivor sister/wounded soldier/and one of the newest SCAR girls, Barbie. I was at Barbie’s quite recent SCAR photo shoot. She is one of the three newest young women to be photographed by David Jay for The SCAR Project. By that, I mean UNFORTUNATELY… there are new SCAR photos… which is why we are doing this. The youngest of the 3 was 22. She was diagnosed when she was 21. Barbie was diagnosed WHILE IN AFGHANISTAN. I’m sorry for the all caps but again… this is why we are doing what we are doing. We must end this bitch of a disease. I think SCAR Project LA producer Diana Haye said it best: “Try fighting in Afghanistan, getting diagnosed with breast cancer, having a mastectomy, and then having the guts and fortitude to help raise awareness for other women baring it all and showing their scars…Barbie did.” And here’s what Barbie said, in this special guest post.] The dog tags and camouflage are real. I am still active duty. I have been in for over 17 years and 2 combat deployments. In February 2011, I was diagnosed with Stage IIIB Breast Cancer, four months after being deployed to Afghanistan. At my own risk, I wanted to participate in the SCAR Project because it is important to me that people understand and know anyone can get breast cancer. In my experience, it’s not something that’s often paid particular attention to due to the overwhelming male population. At some units, I was one of a few and, at times, the only female. We tend to think we are protected and immune to things because we are given a weapon, a FLAK jacket and a Kevlar helmet. I spent most of my time taking care of the troops that were under my charge, a duty that most service members don’t take lightly. I would lay down my life for them. That’s what happened in this case. It’s just that the topography of the battlefield got personal, encroaching way beyond the borders of Afghanistan. I wasn’t willing to accept the lump in my left breast that became obviously larger to me over the weeks that quickly turned into months. I sacrificed my own health and life as long as I could in order to stay and deploy with my unit. We had prepared and trained tirelessly for months and worked ridiculously long hours. Leaving my troops and my unit behind was and still is harder to deal with than my breast cancer diagnosis. The feelings that I abandoned and deserted them and wasn’t able to ensure that they were safely returned home to their families will haunt me for years to come. This may be hard for many people to understand but that is the reality within my world. Breast Cancer has torn me away from not just a career but a way of life that I loved and dedicated and sacrificed for. I am not going to ever get over Breast Cancer or move past it. I will live with it for the rest of my life. I don’t believe most people actually “see” Breast Cancer. They hear about it but they don’t listen. It is just a terrible thing that happens to everyone else but could never happen to them. I hope that when they look at my photograph, they open their eyes and allow themselves to absorb and take it all in and really think about why this is happening to so many young women. Everyone needs to understand the absolute reality of this disease. We have the power to speak up and make a difference. The importance of this goes deeper than just me. My whole family has inherited the Breast Cancer Gene (BRCA2). The fact that there is a great possibility that I have passed this gene on to my son and that my nieces are also at risk makes this whole fight worth it. Even if it is 5, 10, or 20 years from now, it could save their lives. It is my responsibility to preserve their future and ensure their longevity. Every woman David Jay has photographed has their story. That is what makes this project so important. As different as we all are, we share a common bond. It connects us, and it reaches out to others, and connects them to us as well. David Jay has given me the gift of allowing myself to be seen by others as I am now after being chewed up and spit out by cancer. As awkward and uncomfortable as it may be for others to view, I am not embarrassed or ashamed. My young life has been rudely interrupted — and yet, I continue to forge on and accomplish things that others only talk and dream about. Perseverance, endurance, determination….these are the things that have been taught to me and instilled in me. I live in a world where giving up or giving in is not an option. Overcoming is the only way.",0,1,0.10035658785658787
20,10,5,17,6,2012,2012-06-17,"To be so young and yet to have made such a splash and so many ripples of love. [I didn’t want to leave Jolene’s story at the addendum from the previous post… because, although we know the end of her cancer story and that she is resting in paradise—as her brother puts it, or causing chaos among all the angels—as one of her friends posted on her Facebook wall . . . Jolene’s story is far from over. Her SCAR portraits, her memory, her mama, all those of us who love her, and Flat Jolene, continue kicking cancer’s ass and taking names, fighting like our girl Jolene. In other words, she made some ripples down here while she was with us. I like to think it makes her twirl with delight to watch all those ripples of love she created making the universe feel like it’s a small world after all. While we can only sit here star-gazing—and surely Jolene is on the tip of the archer’s bow as he aims for that damn crab—Jolene is. still. making waves. But you, savvy reader, I know you already knew that, because you have caught a glimpse of our lovely Jolene. Plus, I figure you caught the “Part I” in the title of the previous post, and therefore caught on that there was going to be a sequel. So without further ado, here is Part II, written by Jolene’s (and my) dear friend Mary Carpenter. Thank you, Mary. You make pretty ripples too.] b Mary star-gazing. The Gifts We Leave Behind Guest post by Mary Carpenter b If we are wise, we live a life that fills not only us, but those with whom we share it a trunk full of memories. Sometimes we are not wise, though. Sometimes we are frightened and we hide from the pain, uncertainty, fear, and loss. We crouch in the darkened corner believing that we cannot bear one more trauma in our lives. And then, light peeks through the curtains and tiptoes over to that corner and taps us on the shoulder. It beckons us to draw the curtains open and embrace the sun that warms us . . . the clouds that make us dream . . . the rain that nourishes us . . . the wind that bends us . . . and live the life that awaits us. Jolene did just that. She flung back the curtains and opened wide the window that brought her into my life and the lives of many others. She left not just a trunk filled with memories, but a garden filled with gifts for those she left behind. Jolene (on the right) next to her lifelong friend Star b Jolene began planting the seeds in her garden as a child. Perhaps then she wasn’t mindful of the seeds she was planting. She was just being herself… genuine, kind, considerate, loving, and funny. All of those attributes continued nourishing her garden as she and it grew and blossomed. Then the storms began to blow through Jolene’s life and she learned to bend with them gracefully instead of break. Those storms scattered more seeds throughout Jolene’s garden as the dew dripped from her petals and she was courageous enough to share them with us. When the blades of the gardening sheers cut her stem, she found solace in a garden of flowers who had met the same storm called Phyllodes. Together, they nourished one another and strengthened each other’s roots. They, along with many other flowers who had been caught up in the cancer storm cultivated the soil of friendship in the garden. Jolene surrounded friends and family In the last few years of Jolene’s life, she was awed by the gratitude of these flowers not realizing it was they whose soil was most enriched by all she taught them with her honesty and appreciation for even the minutiae of life. Her wit and charm endeared even the weeds to her, but she would not succumb to their negative forces. She continued reaching for the sky and striving to make something beautiful out of the storm that became a hurricane; sometimes subsiding, but never completely diminishing. She opened wide her leaves and petals to share the remnants of the storms’ damages with the world as part of The Scar Project. She wanted the spotlight of the world to shine down on this garden and see that not one ribbon grew in the garden. It was a garden where only flowers grew who had been changed by the blades of the gardening sheers and sometimes even pesticides that would cause petals to shed from the stamen. In this section of the garden, every flower was merely a seedling and Jolene was one of the youngest to sprout here. In her own words, she felt it was the place where her voice would still be heard after she was gone. Jolene’s first SCAR portrait “The SCAR Project was something very emotional for me. It helped me embrace my scars and realize that they are something beautiful and they are forever a part of me. I also see it as something to leave this world after I’m gone. Something for my family to look at and never forget the fight that I fought for my life.” b In the middle of her hurricane, Jolene still dreamed and talked about the things she wanted to do and the places she wanted to go. Some were as simple as wanting to gather in a garden in Florida with some of her favorite flowers and whip off her fake petals once more while singing Red Neck Woman at a karaoke bar, but Jolene’s stem and leaves were too battered by the storm to make the trek, so a paper flower named Flat Jolene was born to travel the world to the places Jolene dreamed of going, but couldn’t. She started her journey in Florida and now has gone to places all over the world on adventures that continue to be shared with Jolene’s family, friends, and many fans. She stood in for Jolene on a cold October weekend in 2011 for the opening of The Scar Project Exhibition in New York City. It was the weekend Jolene died, but Flat Jolene continued living for her. She skated at Rockefeller Center, rode up the elevator in Tiffany’s, went to a Broadway show, and stood somberly at the 9/11 Memorial with the other flowers. Throughout it all, weeping dew knowing that the original blossom, Jolene, had been plucked from the garden and laid to rest. Although Jolene’s life was short, her garden was enormous and will continue to grow. Her roots remain in the soil surrounding the flowers she has touched and nourished with her love of life. The gifts she left behind are not just the material ones like the beautiful ceramics she painted with joy and love for dear friends in the Petroglyph Ceramic garden. They are the flowers she gathered together who can support one another through more storms or dance together in celebration . . . the ability to appreciate the little things . . . “Oh the joys of Hospice living . . . today is sponge bath day! WOOHOO! count your blessings! yes, even taking a shower is a blessing so be sure to wash behind ur ears people!” . . . the understanding that just because a flower sometimes wilts doesn’t mean it is giving up . . . it is taking a moment of quiet reflection . . . the knowledge that another flower has faced a similar storm . . . the ability to choose how one dies and to gracefully, yet honestly live while dying. b b The greatest gift Jolene may have left behind, though, is a community of flowers who are a loving family for her Mama Bear Denise. From the flowers of childhood and high school that routinely check in on Denise and nourish her soil to the Phyllodes and cancer bouquet that blossom love for her, Denise is always surrounded by a devoted garden. This was reflected most profoundly at the recent Scar Project Kick-Off event for Los Angeles. It was a weeklong adventure that began and ended with a road trip taken by Joules Evans, Flat Jolene, and Mama Bear Denise. The Scar Project sisters and community embraced Denise and shared much dew to water the garden. They gave her an opportunity to be Jolene’s voice and see the impact her beautiful blossom had made when she opened her petals and leaves to the world. They allowed her to become a part of not only the garden Jolene left behind, but the blossom Jolene considered her legacy. She left behind a part of her she knew still needed her Mama Bear Denise to bloom. If we are wise, we throw back the curtains and open the window when the light beckons us from that darkened corner like Jolene did. We weclome ourselves into the garden first and begin nourishing our lives with the knowledge that the gifts we leave behind are created in the gardens of our living and even in our dying as it is a part of living in the garden of life.",0,1,0.13643402398756654
22,10,7,29,6,2012,2012-06-29,"[When I first saw my friend Sara’s SCAR portrait it immediately rendered me at a loss for words, which is not an easy thing to do. I mean, I may be crazy shy, but I typically have at least 23,587 words on the tip of my tongue at any given moment, all raising their hands like Horshack, screaming out: “Ooh ooh choose me!” However… they all stood still like they were playing the quiet game or something when I saw Sara’s SCAR portrait. I. Love. the Beauty. And the Bold. Which bursts forth from her picture like it’s rolling on the floor laughing out loud, and maybe even peeing a little, IN THE FACE OF CANCER—and—Cerebral Palsy, to boot. That’s how badass Sara B. is. And that’s why I couldn’t wait to finally meet her in person at the recent SCAR Project DC kickoff cocktail party. And that’s why I can’t wait till you get to meet her here as well. And that’s why I’ll just sit down, maybe grab a cup of espresso with a shot of Baileys, and let her hijack the blog today and tell you her SCAR story in her own words. With Sara’s permission, this is a repost from her blog, “Ready, Pink, and Able” which you can check out and follow HERE.] Guest post by SCAR girl Sara B. Exhausted. Actually, I’m in the spacebeyond exhausted. That’s what I feel. I have been worried about this shoot and its implications for 3 weeks. I want to share the experience, and at the same time, keep special moments for my heart alone. I don’t really want to talk about the experience, and have been telling my friends that they have to wait until I’m ready to talk. The only reason that I’m blogging so soon is that I’m afraid that if put off, it’ll never be done. Photo courtesy of Colleen Roche What can I say about this day? I had a nightmare the night before about breast cancer and mastectomy scars, and then I shook for the longest time, I didn’t think that I would see the end of this day. I kept hoping that David Jaywould call me and cancel. I’m not that strong. Didn’t feel brave –just annoyed, fearful, and worried. I also knew that I wouldn’t back out of it; I see things through to the end. When I make a commitment, I believe in keeping it. It’s just the way I was made…When I’m in, I’m all in. When David got here I announced, “It’s ME!!” He replied, “I know!!” as he kissed me on my cheek. OK. All ice melted at that point. David did his thing as he looked around, and I just tried not to faint or vomit. Congratulate me. No fainting or vomiting!! AND you’ll be amazed. Taking off my top was pretty easy. I am NOT kidding. When it was time to take that part of this journey, I was ready. Who knew? Well, David did! He told me repeatedly over the last weeks that it would be fine. He was right. However, it was much more than fine. I was brave and David was patient. He knew how to wait for honesty. He waited for me and fearlessly took the shots. It was a privilege to be part of those moments. That shawl slipped down so many times; I didn’t worry about it. I was completely at ease. I accepted myself. Breast Cancer is a serious subject. It’s a beast. It stole my breast. I didn’t convey any of those things during the journey that David and I took together. I laughed. Yes, I know. I’m just different. I laughed…and laughed…and laughed some more. I thought about it, and started to panic every so often during the shoot. I thought, “I shouldn’t be laughing. Breast cancer is a monster. Sara, don’t laugh.” Then, I would try to swallow the laughing and look to the camera. It was so unnatural! You can’t be yourself while you’re trying to swallow who you really are. The truth is that while breast cancer is horrible, and I have grieved the loss of my right breast, I don’t live in that place in my heart. The truth, if I’m really honest with myself, is that Sara laughs…she enjoys the freedom of laughter. I really do embrace my faith which tells me that I have been made in the image and likeness of God (Gen 1:26). David, in his wisdom, just said, “It’s OK to laugh, go ahead.” Those moments, when David gave me permission to be happy…honestly joyful, those were my favorite. “I was born to laugh. I learned to laugh through my tears.” -lyrics from “Born” by Over the Rhine. Check out a link to the song HERE. If you’ve read my blog before, you remember that I’ve said that I never thought I would reveal myself in an intimate way to any man outside my spouse (if I ever marry). I just know instinctively that I can only be vulnerable like that if I’m in the presence of love. That is still true. The shoot didn’t change that at all. You see, when I looked at David’s face, I saw love reflected back to me. Now, make no mistake here. There are many different shades of love. I’m not in love with David nor he with me. (Although, I can certainly understand why women would fall for him.) The love that I saw in his face was his humanity truly connecting with mine. I know I didn’t imagine it. It’s probably one of the most wonderful times of my life. It brought tears to my eyes later. I had been loved, and not in any way that I expected. I never thought that I would meet a fashion photographer, let alone that I would find love in his face. Yet, it really happened. In fact, the love in that room helped me survive the moments in between the shots, when I needed to wait for my muscles to relax. I couldn’t stay in the same position for very long, and I just begged to be allowed to move. Cerebral Palsy is betrayal of the highest order. My body’s movements and spasms are often not voluntary, and pain is a frequent albeit unwanted guest. The only troubling part of the afternoon happened when we finished. I sighed and exclaimed,”We’re done, and I’m never doing that again!” I was wholly unprepared for David’s response. He explained that if he didn’t get what he wanted in the shots we had, then we would shoot again. Umm…David…I never said that I would agree to do this again. My heart sank through the spokes of my wheels. I was convinced that he must not have gotten what he needed. I had let him down. I had let all people with disabilities down–never mind myself and the two friends who were present. Talk about pressure. Let’s be real. We had an incredibly talented photographer and we had me. If one of us had ruined the shoot, who would you bet did it? OK. so it’s all moot now. Just look at his photo. Look at the abandon with which I threw back my head. Breast cancer took my breast, and it very well may take my life someday. It will never own me. I am free. Thank you, David, for being my witness.

23,10,8,6,7,2012,2012-07-06,"[I met today’s guest blogger at her SCAR photo shoot in DC this past spring when the cherry blossoms were all abloom and decking out DC for its annual festival. How. Very. Apropos. Methought as I watched this beautiful, courageous, WAY TOO FREAKING YOUNG woman bare her S.C.A.R.s for the camera. At first glance, Eliza’s bright blue-eyes distracted me from the fresh red “angry scars”—as she calls them. Her absolute reality of surviving cancer is as different from mine as my scars are from hers. Mine have faded a bit, as I’m a wee bit (ok, OK… she’s exactly HALF my age but TWICE me in wisdom and stature) older than my younger survivor sister. Mine look more like Japanese symbols for WTF? and are therefore not nearly as angry—though I definitely see red when I see hers. I’ve read before that “the fragility of the cherry blossom is the fragility of human existence.” This was just poetry before I met Eliza. She is currently the youngest of the SCAR girls. Eliza just finished grad school in May and turned 23 in June. Oh, and is planning a wedding. While fighting cancer in her spare time, after being diagnosed earlier this year at twenty-freaking-two. She calls herself an anomaly. I just call her awesome. As I’ve gotten to know Eliza I’ve come to see that beneath that beautiful pale skin is fierce hope unfading, which the sunlight dancing upon it only highlights.] Guest Post by Eliza Hewitt Eliza and Thomas at graduation… and they’re off… planning a wedding for sometime next year… once she’s finished her Ph-freaking-d in chemo and radiation. First of all, I should probably state that I’m only 23, a fact that I hope will shock anyone who feels that they are too young for breast cancer. Before my diagnosis, I was your average grad student working four or five jobs to avoid going further into student loan debt and working out the plans for the wedding of my dreams. The discovery of my cancer has a tragically humorous story behind it. July of 2011, I decided I was fed up with my breasts. They hadn’t grown since middle school so I resolved I would subject them to a breast augmentation surgery. With a coupon for a free consultation in hand, I dragged my fiancé to the plastic surgeon’s office. I remember seeing a placard addressing the office’s policy on insurance covering the surgery if it was for reconstruction. So, as I’m sitting there waiting to meet with the doctor about a boob job, I remark to my fiancé, “Man, wouldn’t it would be great if I got breast cancer because then I wouldn’t have to raise the money for this boob job?” BOOM. There. There’s the awful punchline. I was a baby then and had no idea that the idea I said in jest was really a terribly callous joke that would come back full swing five months later. Sitting on the exam table, the doctor found a pin prick of a lump on my right breast. He raised his eyebrows and asked if I knew about this. A part of me was embarrassed that my body could have something that could prevent surgery, especially since my regular doctor had not found anything during my annual visit two months prior. So I lied. “Of course, I know what that lump is,” I said. He told me to get it checked before the surgery plans could progress. I said that I would but already my mind was thinking that I would have to get back to work. Besides, I was 22. The world was at my feet and it was probably some dinky little cyst that would fade back into my body eventually. So I sat on my knowledge of the lump for five months. I filled my schedule with work and classes to avoid having to think about what the lump could be. In December of 2011, I had an unrelated surgery on my tailbone and a few days later, I started finding blood in my bra. Then, my skin felt hot and I noticed that the lump felt bigger. Oh no. Now, I’m going to have to call my doctor and admit the truth and growing evidence in my boob case. Five months. It didn’t seem like a big deal. In the end I couldn’t face telling my doctor’s office that I had avoided getting my lump checked out and now my boob was being weird, so I turned into a five year old and asked my mother to call. As she was describing my symptoms, it began to sink in how idiotic it was to think if I avoided something that it would go away. I call it the Ostrich Solution to life’s problems. Five months. Is. A big. Deal. The urgency in planning an ultrasound and then an ultrasound guided biopsy on the same day told a story that sent chills up my spine. When the technician slid her magic wand over my right breast, I thought someone had dropped a river pebble in my screen. There was a big black blob smack dab in the middle of my screen and I knew then that it was cancer. It had to be because nothing else can look as sinister. A week later, we got the official news. At 22 years old with classes to pass and weddings to plan, I had breast cancer. It was triple positive, meaning that it loved estrogen and progesterone and for dessert, it was partial to HER 2. A week after my diagnosis, I had a bilateral mastectomy. I was my breast surgeon’s youngest patient. The night before my surgery, I wanted to see mastectomy scars. If I was going to have to wear the scars for the rest of my life, I wanted to know what I would see in the mirror. What I found was The SCAR Project. With each picture, I found stoic, resolved women who dared me to think them weak or pitiful because of their scars. These women were above their diagnosis and I took heart seeing their strength, even as my soul cried for all the beauty affected by breast cancer. It helped me through the night, the surgery, and the breast surgeon’s finding: because of lymph node involvement, I was upgraded to Stage 2B. A few months later, I fell into a deep recess of my former life and couldn’t bear looking at myself without the mirror being entirely fogged up. I emailed David Jay, never daring to hope that he would respond back. I had just gotten involved with the movement to bring the SCAR Project to DC and felt that my contribution would be in the background. I was satisfied knowing that I would help in this way. But David did email me back and the world opened to me again. He asked if I wanted to be photographed. I cried when I thought that anyone would want to take a picture of my scars that I despised even if they meant I was surviving. Here, my poor body was doing all it could to surmount the effects of chemotherapy and I could only see them for what wasn’t there. When I met David in DC, I could barely breathe from the expectation that he would change his mind because as a 22 year old, I felt I should have had a youthful, unabashed spirit that wasn’t facing a life threatening disease. Had I never been diagnosed, I might have felt like a model off to a photo shoot. David told me my scars were beautiful. At first, I rejected this thought thinking maybe he couldn’t see how harsh they looked in the light. But as he took picture after picture, I started to realize that my scars were nothing to be ashamed of. Yes, they made me different from other women my age, but they also made me more resolute and strong like all the women who had photographed before me and given me strength the night before my surgery. It is still hard to look at myself sometimes. I would be lying if I said the opposite. But through my picture and my involvement with the DC exhibit, I have made peace with myself and my scars. Because our scars are there to remind us of the times in our lives that are important to remember and they paint a story of not just survival, but living. This slideshow requires JavaScript.

31,23,1,16,4,2016,2016-04-16,"Lisa Weinberger is the founder of Masters Group Design, a full-service visual communication studio with comprehensive strategic branding capabilities. In the first and second parts of her contribution to Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s 25th Anniversary Blog Series, Lisa explained how her agency has helped define and strengthen LBBC’s brand identity through her team’s amazing use of design and graphics. Here’s the wrap-up to her series. MGD was excited to lead the Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s rebranding process leading up to their 25th Anniversary. Like all things LBBC, it was a collaborative effort that engaged the community at large, volunteers, stakeholders, staff and management. Everyone had a voice. Through meetings, surveys and branding exercises. we broadened our understanding of the power and impact of the organization and the logo that represents it. We also learned about the need to more effectively communicate the unwavering and essential characteristics of LBBC: trusted, supportive, inclusive and compassionate. For weeks, a prolific and intense concepting phase was underway at MGD’s studio. It yielded many options, including some that referenced LBBC’s longtime butterfly icon and others that sharply departed from it. Threading together the entire creative process was a focus on LBBC’s distinctive character and on creating a logo that could inspire hope. What emerged was a matured identity for the organization. The new logo is a symbol of connection—connection to a community, to expert information, to a network of support. The graphic shapes embrace one another in a trusted grip, communicating the reliable nature of LBBC and their partnership with those they serve. The graphic is accompanied by a name that boldly stands in all uppercase letters, with an emphasis on “Living Beyond” to communicate hope—that people are more than a breast cancer diagnosis. The logo was released at the start of 2015. Since then, we’ve been hard at work—first to define a strong and cohesive visual identity, and then to deploy that identity across all LBBC communications.Twenty-five years ago, I came to understand how adrift one can feel when facing illness. Now, as LBBC celebrates 25 years, I have had the rewarding opportunity, along with my creative team, to help them deliver the lifelines of connection, information and support. We are huge cheerleaders for the good that LBBC does, and to be able to help craft that “good” into everything they produce is a great source of pride for us. Congratulations to LBBC on reaching this significant milestone and for their persistence and passion in serving those affected by breast cancer. Thank you for allowing us to design with you, for you. All of us at LBBC want to thank Lisa, Vicki and Benjamin, the team at Masters Group Design, for helping us through the years with your time, talent and generosity. You’ve helped make us the organization we are today! Stories for our 25th Anniversary Blog Series will be published throughout the year.

My name is Natalie Gamble, I am 43 years old and in May of 2014 one phone call changed my life forever. ” Your biopsy came back positive, Natalie I’m so sorry but you have cancer.” Cancer? My first reaction of course was tears. I cried in my husband’s arms afraid of the unknown because while an enlarged lymph node was positive for cancer my mammogram and ultrasound had shown nothing but benign cysts. My first thoughts after my crying jag were: “The Devil is a Lie!” Cue my second reaction, I got mad, I mean fighting mad and decided right then and there no matter what I was faced with I was going to fight and I was going to win. The next few days were a blur of appointments, procedures and tests I never even knew existed. After it was all said and done I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer, Stage II.

Ormerod, MSS, MLSP, LBBC’s Vice President of Programs and Partnerships, blogs about new resources and programs we developed for people living with metastatic breast cancer and LGB people affected by the disease. This month, LBBC introduces two new initiatives to provide our brand of trusted information and support to two underserved populations in the breast cancer community: people living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and lesbian, gay and bisexual people diagnosed with breast cancer. LBBC’s Hear My Voice Outreach Program will train 25 individuals from around the country and who are living with metastatic disease to connect others with resources, information and support for coping with stage IV breast cancer. Original LBBC research, confirmed by subsequent surveys, revealed that those living with MBC feel isolated, misunderstood and often unaware of programs and resources tailored to their experience. Other studies show that participation in peer outreach programs improves emotional health and well-being. I see the power of connection at every one of LBBC’s conferences and thus I am very excited to begin the Hear My Voice Outreach Program at LBBC’s Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer in April. We have already received many applications for the first Hear My Voice, so we know we have tapped into a large, unmet need. Our second initiative centers on original content we developed to assist lesbian, gay and bisexual people living with breast cancer get the quality of care they need and deserve. For many, coming out to members of their healthcare team can be difficult or scary. The guide, which is the first of its kind for people with breast cancer, provides information, support and resources to help make having these conversations easier.

35,23,102,3,2,2015,2015-02-03,"Update 10/7/15: Norma passed away in September 2015. Below is a blog post she wrote for LBBC. On Super Bowl The NFL Countdown crew aired a tribute to late ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, who passed away last month from cancer of the appendix. Hear My Voice blogger Norma Pitzer-Kelly writes about the sports anchor’s decision to share his cancer experience with the public, and how his words can guide those living with stage IV breast cancer. Stuart Scott died on January 4th, 2015. If you aren’t into sports or have friends and family who watch Sports Center on ESPN, you may have no idea who he is. Stuart was a sportscaster and host on that show. He was a pioneer in sports broadcasting and was well loved by professional athletes, celebrities, co-workers and friends. He was also a cancer patient. Stuart fought this disease for 7 years. It started in 2007 with an emergency appendectomy which turned out to be cancer of the appendix. Did you even think cancer of the appendix was a thing? I didn’t. Cancer is an insidious monster and it will attack you anywhere – I know that, and yet I didn’t think about the appendix as being susceptible. I was introduced to Stuart while watching Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts interviewed him last spring. During that interview, he told the story of his diagnosis, talked about his daughters and his refusal to give up hope. Stuart was a devoted and loving father, he was an icon in the sports community, and his style and catch phrases will live on, but he, unfortunately, will not. After fighting like a champion with strength, grace and a quiet dignity the monster took his life, and those daughters he was so devoted to will have to live the rest of their lives without him. I didn’t know Stuart personally, of course. I can’t even say I watched his show on ESPN – I didn’t. But after following his journey with cancer, I feel sadness at his loss, as if he had been a friend. Having cancer gives you membership into a club you never wanted to join and camaraderie with other “members” that make you feel like old friends even if you’ve never met. As a metastatic breast cancer patient, I have felt this connection to others first hand many times over. Continue reading →",0,1,0.12528860028860028

LBBC blogger and friend Tiffany Mannino is back, but this time, instead of sharing one of her entries from her self-titled letters ‘Beautifully Broken: Letters From a Girl/Woman/Human in Progress’ penned to her unborn daughter Lola during her breast cancer journey, she’s here to share what being 5 years out from her cancer diagnosis means to her and what she’s learned in the process… Three weeks ago, I celebrated my five year survivor anniversary. Whether or not the medical world would allow me to call myself ‘cured’, December 16 th was an absolutely incredible day and a milestone I will never forget. They say it takes a village to raise a child, but I as reflect on the last five years of my life, I believe that it also takes a village to raise a cancer survivor. I will never forget when it first hit me that I had my very own village. May 2010…my first Race for the Cure as a survivor. Our Breastfix at Tiffany’s team of more than twenty came together on a very cold, May morning. I was freezing and SO weak from chemo, but I crossed that finish line with tears in my eyes and incredible joy in my heart. I can’t ever remember a time feeling more loved and supported. Today: Celebrating where life has taken her. I can’t believe that moment was almost five years ago. In some ways it seems like yesterday and in other ways it seems like a lifetime ago. Of course, me being me, I have taken a lot of time to reflect on what I’ve learned and how I have grown from this experience. In some ways, my post cancer journey has been more difficult than being in ‘battle mode’. Having cancer changed the course of my life and although I was unbelievably thankful that God healed me, I also had to ask, “Ok. I’m alive. Now what?” I was in my late thirties, divorced, unable to bear children, and completely lost. Several years later, I’m still trying to figure it all out, but the greatest thing I have learned is that I am so blessed because although I may not know where my life is headed, I have a village. I have family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, students, parents, doctors, yogis, trainers, fellow survivor sisters, bloggers, and even former boyfriends who love and support me no matter what.

38,23,105,26,12,2014,2014-12-26,"Our December Hear My Voice blogger is Kelly Shanahan, MD, who writes about her shift from being a healthcare provider to being the person receiving health care for bone metastasis. I used to think the hardest thing I’d ever done was survive medical school and a 4-year ob-gyn residency at Temple University Hospital when the program was in chaos and we were short five (out of 20) residents. Then I was diagnosed with stage IIB breast cancer in 2008. Then the hardest thing I’d ever done was telling my not quite nine-year-old daughter I had cancer. “Mommy, are you going to die?” was her first question and my answer was “Yes, I’m going to die someday, and so is the cat and so is the dog, but I’m NOT going to die from breast cancer – I’m going to kick cancer’s ass!” Following treatment, I thought, in my arrogant doctor mode, that I was done. I beat the disease, I was a survivor! HA! While walking upstairs one day in July 2013, I sneezed and immediately developed searing back pain. I ignored the pain, and when it didn’t improve, sought help from a massage therapist and my chiropractor. It didn’t get better and I figured I must have herniated a disc. I’d get an MRI eventually, and maybe one of those inversion tables would fix it. I was a busy gynecologist and I didn’t have time for any herniated disc or chronic back pain. In a supreme twist of irony, I began subleasing my office to an oncologist one day a week. While dropping off supplies on the day he was there, he noticed me limping. “What’s wrong”, he asked. ”Oh, I think I herniated a disc”, I answered. He looked at me, and said, “You’ve had breast cancer. You need an MRI and a PET scan.” Yeah, yeah, I thought, I’ll get around to it when I have time. I finally scheduled the MRI and PET for November 14, 2013. Not done with irony, this is my birthday. I figured after the PET scan, I’d go home and go out for a nice dinner with my husband and our daughter, 2 weeks shy of her own 15th birthday. I had turned my phone off for the tests. First was the MRI, then the PET. Being a doctor who sends lots of patients to the imaging facility where I had the tests done, I knew I could review the results with the radiologist, confirm the herniated disc I just knew I had, stop at Costco on the way home and buy an inversion table and I’d be good as new in no time. HA again. When I went to my car after the PET, there was a message from the oncologist I sublease my office to; I had listed him as my doctor. “Kelly, call me, here’s my cell number” was the message. In that instant I knew I had metastatic disease. I went back into the imaging facility and went to see how bad it was: it was in every bone in my body.

One of the things that I often admire most about the work we do at LBBC is the level of commitment to our mission that is shared by our constituency. Recently, I was able to reflect again about how deep that commitment runs. Over the last few weeks, as we have been preparing stories for our upcoming quarterly newsletter, Insight, this admiration struck me again. That’s because an article in our Spring 2015 edition will feature personal reflections by some of our supporters about what LBBC means to them as well as why they feel it is important to give back to our organization. One of these stories comes from Terry Frangiosa of Harleysville, Pennsylvania. Terry, while not diagnosed with breast cancer herself, has been a long-time LBBC supporter who says “I attended my first LBBC conference with my sister, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33. We were both shocked and frightened by the diagnosis, especially because she was so young. We left feeling empowered by the information we learned at that conference. As our knowledge grew our fear decreased and the conference became a part of my sister’s healing process. Donating to LBBC’s Guardian Angel program, a service that offsets conference registration fees for those experiencing economic hardship, is my way to help others access the information and support they need and to make a difference in their lives. I know attending that conference years ago did exactly that for my sister and family.” Continue reading →",0,1,0.04545454545454546

By Chris Wilson, Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation Trustee Kathleen Swiger stands by her poster in the “Psychosocial and Behavioral” section of the vast hall at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the second of two that Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) presented at this important meeting. There’s a lot interest from the attendees, both advocates and medical professionals. They study the data and ask Swiger questions about the results. “The posters are just the tip of the iceberg,” she says, pointing to the panels behind her. “There is so much more data in the full survey.” The LBBC study is the first survey of psychosocial, nonmedical, needs of women with triple-negative breast cancer. It provides clear and compelling evidence that women with this subtype of the disease have higher levels of fear, anxiety and worry than women with other subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, these concerns continue throughout their treatment and beyond. Continue reading →",0,1,0.10192307692307692

Last week, a colleague approached me to talk about her sister-in-law, who is about to have a lumpectomy and radiation. I assumed she wanted to talk about cancer. I was more than happy to lend my insights, but what I realized was that what she was asking me was: what can I get for a woman who has cancer? I asked her to clarify, and what she was actually asking me was: what can I buy for her so she can feel better about this whole ugly situation? And maybe she was also saying was: what can I buy for her, so I can feel better about this whole ugly situation? Either way, I’m all for gift giving; everyone benefits. I have to admit, one of the unexpected by-products of having cancer was that I received a number of thoughtful and inspired gifts. When I say gifts, what I mean is I received many tangible items, from writing journals to pillow cases, to already read and loved books, to comfortable pajamas and organic skincare products. I also received many intangible things, like support and love, guidance and friendship. I was more than happy to receive these things because they did make me feel better, and now when I meet a woman who has been diagnosed, I send her a gift. I have given headscarves and writing journals, big hoop earrings and organic skincare products. I have also given phone calls and hugs. So in thinking about my gift giving, I have devised a list of both tangible and intangible gifts that one can give and ask for this season and beyond. Continue reading →",0,1,0.26614583333333336
42,23,109,5,12,2014,2014-12-05,"The open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace began last month and goes until February 15, 2015. In this guest post, Anne Filipic, President of Enroll America, blogs about the changes in health insurance in the last few years and how they impact women affected by breast cancer. Until recently, pre-existing conditions have kept many women from getting the health insurance necessary to diagnose and treat their illness. So, at a time when they needed health insurance to help save their lives, many were left facing the full cost of hefty medical bills on their own. With hundreds of thousands of dollars in doctor visits, tests, medication, and more, it’s a cost that many couldn’t afford. As a cancer survivor, you may have been turned down or charged more for health insurance in the past. But now, that is no longer an issue. Having a pre-existing condition can no longer prevent you from getting quality, affordable coverage. And you can’t be charged more for health insurance because of your medical history. This is true even if you’ve previously been turned down or charged more for coverage due to a pre-existing condition. Now, hundreds of thousands of women who are fighting breast cancer have access to the life-saving medical care they need. In addition, preventive care for key services is now free, such as breast cancer genetic test counseling (BRCA) for women at higher risk for breast cancer, mammograms every one to two years for women over age 40, and breast cancer chemoprevention counseling for women at higher risk.

43,23,11,3,2,2016,2016-02-03,"Susan Ryan talks about navigating breast reconstruction options and the factors she considered when making decisions. Join us February 17 to listen to Susan and a panel of others who have considered reconstructive surgery discuss their experiences in our free webinar, Let’s Talk: Making Breast Reconstruction Decisions. “It is crucial to find doctors who will listen to your thoughts, needs and feelings. Why? Because a cancer diagnosis pulls the rug out from underneath our feet. We need to exercise some control over some decisions.” The quote comes from Susan Ryan’s e-book, Cancer Is Not My Boss – Today or Tomorrow, a pre- and post-mastectomy resource for people diagnosed with breast cancer who have also experienced child abuse. Susan wrote those words not only as a clinical psychologist, but also as a woman who understands those feelings. After her own diagnosis in 2012, Susan ensured she asked the right questions and felt comfortable with her doctors as she navigated diagnosis and treatment. This was especially important to her when it came to making decisions about breast reconstruction. In the first blog post of the Let’s Talk Breast Reconstruction Series, Susan tells Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Digital Media Specialist, Josh Fernandez, about her crash course in breast reconstruction, including talking with providers, understanding her options and empowering others. Josh: Why did you decide to get immediate breast reconstruction? Susan: My plastic surgeon Dr. Matthew Becker was available to operate on me after my breasts were removed. I thought I could return back to my life more quickly because there would be less surgeries vs other reconstructive surgeries. I had a great sex life before cancer and wanted it to continue after breast reconstruction. Cancer would take away my breasts, but it was not going to ruin my marriage or my sex life. I thought I would look more natural which would be less upsetting to those around me including me. Josh: You got tissue expanders with silicone implants. How did you decide on that option? Susan: I consulted with Jane Brannon of Komen of Knoxville and she was extremely helpful. She gave me a crash course on breast reconstruction. She told me that the Dr. Matthew Becker is known as the “magician in the community.” She told me that there were other options out there, but since I like to work out it might change the way my body works, i.e. abs would not be as strong, or if they took the dorsal muscle, swimming might weaken on one side. Since I like to swim, bike and run, implants seemed like a good fit for my lifestyle. Implants offered fewer surgeries than the other methods, which was a big plus. I also found out that they do not leak. Josh: How did you feel about communicating your concerns about reconstruction with your provider(s)? Susan: Communication with Dr. Becker was awesome. He listened. He was not rude. He answered my long list of questions at each visit. He gave me eye contact and smiled at me. He only wanted to create the breasts that I wanted. He was never critical of my body nor did he ever try to sell me on more procedures or products. I told him I wanted as close to what I had before and that is what he gave me. He was responsive when I had issues. He saw me right before he had to catch a flight to California when I had called that morning about by chest being red. He put me on antibiotics right away. He called me later to tell me to go to the hospital when he thought my labs looked off and he was right. He called throughout the weekend to check on me. I had a leaky expander in Sept of 2012 (he replaced it in 3 days, a staph infection in November of 2012 and capsular contracture. A compassionate doctor makes a huge difference. Josh: In addition to your practice, writing and volunteering at events, you’re also an LBBC Breast Cancer Helpline Volunteer. What’s the biggest piece of advice you give to callers concerned about making breast reconstruction decisions? Susan: Being comfortable with your doc is so important. Research shows that usually a patient’s immune system gets stronger with a good bond between doctor and patient, we recover faster when we go through an illness and/or complications. I encourage women to be open with their doctors. If there are any issues that are bothering them, it’s a great idea to put them on the table. It’s very important that when she is done with surgeries she has the size breasts that she wanted and not just what her surgeon thinks looks good. Josh: What other important point would you like our readers to know about making decisions around reconstruction? Susan: The choices belong to you. Breast reconstruction can be a time for transformation. It can be a time to go smaller or bigger or stay the same size. There are many choices out there. It can be the chance to never have saggy breasts again. In spite of the fact that I thought I looked a bit like Frankenstein post-mastectomy, it changed dramatically within six months. I went from not caring who saw my chest to wanting privacy because my chest began to look like I had breasts again. I tell newly diagnosed women that my breasts are beautiful. That when a doctor has to examine me, he or she always tells me how great they look. More importantly, I feel good when I look in the mirror. I see a woman who survived not only child abuse but breast cancer. Susan Ryan is a clinical psychologist who helps people work through trauma. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012. Cancer taught her very quickly that her self-care needed improvement. At the time of her diagnosis, there seemed to be very little written about specific techniques for people with cancer to psychologically cope, especially if they’ve had a history of child abuse. This motivated her to write an e-book on Amazon, Cancer Does Not Own Me – Today or Tomorrow, as a resource for those working through trauma in addition to a cancer diagnosis. When she’s not working or competing in 5K races, Susan volunteers in her community for mental health events and for LBBC’s Breast Cancer Helpline.

44,23,110,4,12,2014,2014-12-04,"Written By Josh Fernandez, Digital Media Specialist Stephanie Joseph, 50, tells her doctors everything they need to know to help her maintain her health. When she was diagnosed with stage IIA, HER2-positive breast cancer in 2010, she applied this personal rule to her cancer care team by sharing her sexual orientation with them. “The oncologist, radiologist, breast surgeon, plastic surgeon and nurses—I don’t think there was anyone on my care team who didn’t know I was a lesbian,” the Washington, D.C. area resident says. Studies suggest that being overweight, drinking alcohol, not having children, not breast feeding and smoking may increase a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. Lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to have some of these risk factors, which in turn may increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Stephanie says she had some of those risk factors, which is why she thought it was important to talk about her sexual orientation when she brought up her full health history. “It’s part of my care; it’s the overall picture of who I am and where I’ve been,” she says. “This disease was going to affect me a little differently because of who I am.” Getting Help During and After Treatment Stephanie’s oncologist told her that she needed a mastectomy of her right breast, followed by treatment with chemotherapy and the targeted therapy trastuzumab (Herceptin). Her breast surgeon recommended she have someone help her the first week after surgery, while she was recovering. “I told him I didn’t have a choice—I wasn’t married; I didn’t have a girlfriend and my family wouldn’t be able to help,” Stephanie recalls. As she worried about the first week of recovery, Stephanie remembered a support program her friend with brain cancer used in the early 1990s. She contacted the Mautner Project, now part of Whitman-Walker Health in Washington, D.C., an organization that helped lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people through advocacy, education, primary medical care and support services. A Mautner volunteer came to Stephanie’s home every day of the week after her surgery. The volunteer helped her with household chores and made sure she rested and didn’t strain herself. Mautner volunteers also helped get her groceries on a weekly basis and drive her to and from the hospital for treatment. “They cleaned for me, landscaped, put furniture together—if they couldn’t do something, they’d let me know,” Stephanie remembers. “I don’t know what I would have done without them.” Stephanie sought help for her emotional needs as well. Before she finished breast cancer treatment in 2011, Stephanie began seeing a therapist. that matched her personality. “For me, it’s really important that I click with my therapist, my oncologist, primary care doctor, podiatrist—any healthcare provider,” Stephanie says. “If someone is taking care of you, I think it’s important you feel comfortable with that person, especially when you are dealing with breast cancer.” Body Image and Dating After Treatment One of the biggest issues Stephanie and her therapist worked on was Stephanie’s body image concerns after surgery. In addition to mastectomy, Stephanie had breast reduction surgery on her opposite breast. She was really concerned about how a partner would view her and did not date until she finished taking trastuzumab. She considered getting breast reconstruction. “I was going to have more surgery, and then I asked myself an important question: Who am I doing this for?” Stephanie recalls. She asked herself if she wanted reconstruction because she was ashamed of the way she looked, or because she worried nobody would find her attractive. Stephanie says that after enough time and therapy, she realized her breasts do not define her. When she looks at her chest, she now sees the tissue from after her mastectomy as a battle scar. “I’m almost proud of it in some ways, that I am resilient, and that scar is a sign of that,” Stephanie says. Stephanie decided not to have breast reconstruction. She will continue to date until she finds the right partner for her. “If I’m going to be alone for the rest of my life, it’s not going to be because I have one breast,” she says. “It’s going to be because I didn’t meet the right person. I’m convinced of that.”",0,1,0.2705612244897961

Lynn writes about her sister, Deb, who offered tremendous love and support to Lynn throughout her experience with breast cancer. My sister and I were standing near the finish line for the Philadelphia Marathon this past weekend. We were eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of my nephew and his fiancé so we could cheer and support them as they ran. While waiting to see them pass by, I enthusiastically cheered and clapped for all those running the marathon. I was overwhelmed at the number of all of those present showing support to those they love. With my sister by my side, I thought that she should be cheered for in the same manner as my caregiver. Let me start by saying, I love my sister Deb. She is quite reserved and is one who does not like being in the spotlight. She has one of the biggest hearts and is one of the most giving and caring individuals I know. I have thanked her many times in a variety of ways to acknowledge her support during my breast cancer diagnosis and treatment; yet, I don’t think she fully understands the enormous positive impact that her caregiving had on my healing. My sister and I were always close. During the time we shared as co-caregivers for my mom, who had laryngeal cancer, our bond became that much stronger. Two months after my mother passed away, I had my annual mammogram. Two weeks after the results of my normal mammogram, I had a pain underneath my arm. Although my sister is no longer a practicing nurse, I asked her opinion. She encouraged me to go to the doctor for more information. The initial doctors visit led me first to an x-ray and then to an ultrasound, which was suspicious, and then on to a needle/core biopsy. My sister insisted on coming with me to the biopsy, and so her journey of being my caregiver began. I waited a few weeks for the biopsy results, but quite honestly after I heard the doctor say that 90 percent of these are benign, the thought of cancer left my mind. I was about to leave for a business trip for Miami when I received the call at work about my breast cancer diagnosis. Stunned and shocked, I hung up the phone and immediately called my sister. Her husband answered the phone and I managed to utter Deb’s name. He could tell that I was upset and my sister quickly picked up the phone. I was desperately trying to breathe, I gasped to find my voice to utter actual words, but ultimately found myself unable to speak. However, no words were required, the silence mixed with sobbing said it all – she understood, I had breast cancer. Continue reading →",0,1,0.11003607503607499

Renee Sendelbach blogs for the Hear My Voice series about her experience dealing with depression before and after she learned she had stage IV disease. No one ever told me that cancer could lead to depression. But if I am being completely honest, I guess no one ever told me a lot of things about cancer. And if I am being even more honest, I can easily ask, how could cancer not lead to depression? The person I was for 30 years – a healthy, strong-willed, happy-go-lucky woman, ready to change the world – was all the sudden ripped away from me in a few seconds when I heard one word – cancer. I first noticed the signs of depression in 2009. I had finished 8 rounds of chemo and a lumpectomy for my then Stage 1 breast cancer. I was in the midst of my 36 radiation treatments when I broke down with emotions. I couldn’t shake the sadness that seemed to hang over my every day. The world seemed to be closing in around me. I certainly couldn’t understand WHY I was like this now…after all, I had just “beaten cancer.” I tried to chalk it all up to me feeling exhausted. Deep down I knew it was something more when even spending time with my husband and 18-month-old son was unbearable and hard. I couldn’t put my finger on it, so I talked to my oncologist who told me depression is very common in the situation I was in – just out of chemo, surgery and radiation.

55,23,120,13,11,2014,2014-11-13,"Research shows resilience can ease stress and improve life satisfaction among people diagnosed with cancer, but what does it mean to be “resilient”? In anticipation of our November 18 community meeting in Denver, Colorado, Jill Mitchell, LCSW, PhD, OSW-C, of the Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers offers some insight and tips on being resilient. In physics, “resilience” is defined as the ability of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed, and to release that energy (bounce back). The limit of resilience, in turn, is the point at which the material can no longer absorb energy elastically without creating a permanent distortion. But resilience in the cancer world, is not as much about bouncing “back” as it is about bouncing “forward” – creating a “new normal” or even growing through the process of survivorship. Resilience goes beyond just coping or just being “elastic.” It often also involves (or sometimes demands) a “permanent distortion in one’s life” (such as a loss of a breast, or a job or an anticipated future, for example). However, it is these “distortions,” or losses, that can provide the fodder for growth and transformation when we call upon our internal resources (self-esteem, optimism, hopefulness, problem solving) and our external resources (friends and family, social and community support). I am often awed and humbled by the ways in which people come to cope with and grow through the struggles or suffering they endure due to cancer. One of the most important things to know is that although some people may have a more natural tendency toward resilience, we all can strengthen our ability toward resilience through a few specific strategies: Start with your strengths – what already works for you, or has worked for you in the past? Perhaps you are someone who needs to gather a lot of information. Perhaps you feel rejuvenated being surrounded by nature, or writing in a journal or meditating. Remind yourself about the strategies you already know help you to cope, and make time for those! Resilience is about developing realistic goals and moving toward them. Start with what works for you. Develop and use your network of support – Share what you’re going through with your trusted loved ones, friends, and peers. Explore support groups or consult one-on-one with your oncology social worker or other healthcare professionals who can be a resource for support, processing and validation. Asking for help and sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can feel challenging and uncomfortable for people who are used to being in control or self-dependent. And yet, social support is a critical cornerstone for resilience. Continue reading →",0,1,0.07064393939393938

As a partner of our Going Beyond October campaign, 5-hour ENERGY staff member Melissa Skabich is sharing with us why she’s proud to work for an organization who supports the breast cancer cause beyond October. I am the director of public relations for the makers of 5-hour ENERGY. I’m also a wife, a mom to three boys under age 11, a sometimes runner, and a soon-to-be owner of a French bulldog puppy named Mack. Before I was any of those things, I was a young college graduate who watched cancer kill my 43-year-old godmother in a matter of ten short weeks. Kidney. And way before that, I was an eight-year-old girl feeding teaspoons of chocolate ice cream to my grandfather, who once seemed like the strongest man in the world but the cancer made him so weak he could barely lift his head. A few weeks later I made my very first public speaking appearance when I read at his funeral. It was my first real loss, and I missed him so much my chest would hurt. Now, even 30 years later, I still feel a pang whenever I hear Phil Collins’ “Against All Odds” on the radio. It was my grief anthem. Lung. Continue reading →",0,1,0.028947368421052635
57,23,122,7,11,2014,2014-11-07,"There are many ways a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment can impact your sexual life. In anticipation of our new publication, Breast Cancer inFocus: Getting the Care You Need as a Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual Person, Susan DiPronio blogs about navigating sex and dating after breast cancer in the LGBT community. While we’re dealing with breast cancer and the side effects of treatment, it’s difficult to embrace our sexual needs immediately and long after treatment ends. Our bodies are ragged. We’ve been exhausted for, well, years. Maybe we’ve lost lovers or friends, and for some of us, jobs, careers. For those of us who identify as lesbian or bisexual, we became invisible, almost dissolving into the background of the LGBT community, that social scene where we’re now a stranger invited, but not valued. When I was going through chemo, a friend came to visit me. She talked about her night out at the bars, sharing her usual brand of entertaining trash-talk. All the while not looking me in the eye, intentionally avoiding my gaze. I was used to it, expected it. My appearance scared me enough that I couldn’t look in a mirror. My friend starts telling me about a woman she was shocked to see out the night before, partying with other women, dancing nonetheless. My friend mentioned that this woman had cancer. She was stunned that the woman would be out. I was stunned that my friend was saying this to me. Our sexual and emotional desires don’t just end because we’ve had breast cancer. Yet, people shuffle us into another kind of closet, the “cancer closet,” and assume we no longer have an appetite for sex and intimacy. As survivors, we also put pressure on ourselves when it comes to sex after breast cancer. Breasts are a big part of sex and if they’re gone or scarred, we don’t feel as if anyone would want us and our self-esteem suffers. But sexual desire never disappears. How do we navigate this difficult metamorphosis? Where do we find the support so necessary in rebuilding a positive body image? I’ve decided to become the person I used to be and not be afraid to touch my scars, to embrace sexuality, to look at myself in the mirror. Continue reading →",0,1,0.02354545454545455
58,23,123,5,11,2014,2014-11-05,"The cover of Madhulika Sikka’s book, “A Breast Cancer Alphabet.” (image via http://www.abreastcanceralphabet.com/) LBBC Writer and Editorial Coordinator Erin Rowley reviews Madhulika Sikka’s book, A Breast Cancer Alphabet. Cancerland is a place you never planned to visit. Author Madhulika Sikka didn’t want to go there either. But through her book, A Breast Cancer Alphabet, she volunteers to be your tour guide as you navigate life after a breast cancer diagnosis. “This book,” she says, “is for all of you who have become members of a club you did not want to join,” as well as for your friends and family members. A Breast Cancer Alphabet is a quick read – Ms. Sikka, a broadcast journalist who was diagnosed in 2010, writes that she wanted “a short book that wouldn’t tax my chemo-addled brain.” But she manages to address many topics, from the more obvious ones (B is for Breasts, D is for Drugs, M is for Mastectomy) to ones that may seem frivolous next to the question of survival, but are important to your quality of life (S is for Sex, H is for Hair, L is for Looks, F is for Fashion Accessories). In the chapter T is for Therapy, she stresses that treatment should go beyond chemotherapy and physical therapy. She says it should include psychotherapy and aspects of everyday life that are therapeutic for you, like watching a marathon of your favorite TV show or staying in bed (P is for Pillows, X is for eXhaustion, Z is for ZZZ’s.)

59,23,124,3,11,2014,2014-11-03,"Written by Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer If she hadn’t been a young woman, Meghan Malley believes, her concerns about breast pain and breast changes would have been investigated more carefully. That realization has fueled her commitment to help other young women. Meghan had a noncancerous breast tumor removed when she was 21. For years after, her doctor said pain she had in the same breast was nothing serious. At 27, that breast developed dense tissue. Meghan worried because her family has a history of cancer, including breast cancer. She was denied a mammogram at first due to being younger than guidelines recommend. After she received the test, she was told she had fibrocystic or dense breasts. Meghan and her husband, who live in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, wanted to start a family. She began taking medicine to increase ovulation and had breast pain again. A breast ultrasound showed increased bloodflow compared to tests conducted the previous year. The doctor thought the change was caused by the fertility medicine and, again, told her not to worry. She objected because she had been on the medicine for only a month. “I demanded that somebody follow up.” Finding Care A breast surgeon examined her, found swollen lymph nodes and did an immediate biopsy. Meghan had stage IV, or metastatic, breast cancer. She was 29. The disease was lobular, a type not easily detected on mammograms. After considering her options, she chose a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Detroit for treatment. Meghan, who is receiving ongoing treatment, now sees herself as a partner with her oncologist in her care. She also decided to expand her advocacy efforts. “I was an advocate for myself at the doctor’s and that failed me,” she says. “There are still a lot of things we need to do better—screening for young women, (detection in) dense breasts, inclusion of metastatic women at events….It just takes one person to speak up.” From Passion to Action With help from a cancer center social worker, Meghan organized a wellness support group for women in their 40s and younger. Like Meghan, many who join do not feel comfortable in groups with mostly older women. She had tried attending a group for young women with breast cancer, but she didn’t return. As the only woman there with metastatic disease, “they looked at me like their worst nightmare,” she says. The monthly wellness group is open to young women with any cancer type or stage. “It’s nice to have people who can understand where you’re coming from. They have some of the same pains, hurts and dilemmas in life,” Meghan says. Now 32 and a full-time physical therapist, she enjoys being a professional caregiver for people with neurological conditions. She says her experience “helped me become a better clinician. It gives me a greater appreciation of what [my patients] are going through, and the trials and tribulations of living life with what is, most of the time, an incurable disease.” On weekends, she takes photographs as a side business. “Photography has been a big emotional help. Behind the lens, I don’t feel like a patient,” she says. Meghan participates in breast cancer events, won an award for her advocacy and appears in several LBBC videos on young women’s issues. “I feel like we all can try and make a difference,” she says. “I don’t have a choice about having this disease for the rest of my life. If I have to go through this, I want to at least have a positive impact.” Staying in Balance Meghan’s network of friends and family gives her strength. She and her husband were high school sweethearts. He has been “amazingly supportive” as she dealt with the disease and the “guilt and sadness…all these things you don’t expect to think about when you’re 29.” “He reassures me we can get through anything,” she says. They have busy, full lives. “We may do more now, instead of putting it off. It’s given us a better appreciation for each other.” This article was supported by Cooperative Agreement Number DP11-1111 from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Unell is the founder of Back in the Swing USA® and co-author of The Back in the Swing Cookbook: Recipes for Eating and Living Well Every Day After Breast Cancer. Ms. Unell wrote this blog post in anticipation of our upcoming town hall meeting, Survivorship 360: Navigating Your Way Through the Re-Designed Breast Cancer Roadmap. I love the new song, “3 Things,” by Jason Mraz. In fact, I love it so much, that I decided to make it the theme of this blog, using a bit of poetic license to play off of Mraz’s message. He sings about the three things that he does “when his life falls apart.” His words resonate with me today, as I reflect on this particular moment in time in the history of breast cancer survivorship healthcare, a field in which I have planted seeds, along with hundreds of caring volunteers, dedicated healthcare professionals and generous sponsors, for the past 15 years. I hope that you will take a moment (3 minutes, actually) to sit back, listen to Mraz’s song and be inspired, too. The song’s lyrics remind me of my “new life” that started in the exhilarating days of 1999, after my treatment for breast cancer, when I was focused on “changing the conversation” between physician and patient. As an author, educator and social entrepreneur who is committed to translating scientific research into practical action, I was determined to move that conversation for consumers of cancer healthcare from the anxiety-filled moments of asking, “Now what?” to the confident steps of receiving a comprehensive, personalized survivorship care plan and follow-up recommendations during and/or after primary treatment ends.

63,23,128,23,10,2014,2014-10-23,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer Katie Post looked forward to finishing chemotherapy so she could go back to her favorite activity: falling. Out of an open door. At 10,000 feet in the air. Katie loved skydiving. She started the sport after her mother gave her a tandem jump as a gift, where she was attached to an experienced instructor. Soon she took lessons and began jumping solo. When diagnosed with stage I breast cancer at age 32, Katie was grounded from skydiving, but only for a while. She had a lumpectomy, then jumped after finishing eight rounds of chemotherapy. She headed for the sky again as soon as she could after 30 radiation sessions. So far, she has jumped 43 times. “In a way, it’s very easy to fall out of a plane,” she says.“I’m really good at falling.” Facing Realities She sounds fearless, but Katie is quick to say she was scared when she received her breast cancer diagnosis. After she found a lump, she went to a clinic run by a local church and hospital in Leesburg, Florida, where she was living at the time. The clinic gave her a mammogram and ultrasound. She was called back for a needle biopsy and told she probably had a fibroadenoma, a noncancerous breast lump sometimes found in girls and young women. Katie had no health insurance. “My first thought was, ‘Oh,my God, how am I going to pay for this?’” she recalls. “It wasn’t, ‘Oh, my God,I have cancer!’” When she found out she had breast cancer, she felt afraid and isolated. “I didn’t know there were all these support systems out there,” she says. To prepare for losing her hair during chemotherapy, Katie had her friends cut it off, todonate to children with medical hair loss. A friend videotaped the event for YouTube. Katie asked others she met at the infusion center lots of questions. “I learned from them. By the time I got to my fourth chemo,” she says, understanding and experiencing the process “was easy.” Katie had been dating someone before she was diagnosed; afterward, she ended the relationship. “I was dating the wrong guy,” she explains. “[Breast cancer] gave me the push to break up with him.” New Horizons As she went through treatment, Katie realized she wanted to help others know there’s life after breast cancer. She applied for the LBBC Young Advocate Program. At the training sessions, “I felt these were my sisters,” she says, describing the women who participated with her. When it was over, “I felt more empowered because of the program.” Katie has given out breast cancer information at doctors’ offices and treatment centers. She has shared her phone number with others who’ve been diagnosed, so they can have someone to talk with who’s been through treatment. She has also started making strides for her own future. Before her diagnosis, Katie had been cleaning houses and looking for a job that would make use of her biology degree. “Nothing was working for me,” she says. She had done pharmaceutical research during college and enjoyed it, but she graduated when the economy was down and there were few jobs. This fall, she started pharmacy school in Hilo, Hawaii. She can see the mountain, Mauna Kea, and the Pacific Ocean from her kitchen door. Katie is also continuing her advocacy work, handing out breast cancer information at her university’s health fair and participating in a local walk. “I’m trying to get as involved as I can, while also being a student. My life is very hectic right now,” she says. She’s still adjusting to being far from family and friends and dealing with menopausal side effects from treatment. She’s required to wear a lab coat and pants in laboratory science classes, but the air conditioning isn’t powerful enough to counter the hot flashes she endures. “I carry a sweat rag,” she says. Yet Katie appreciates one change resulting from treatment. “I love my short hair now,” she says. “Thanks, chemo!

64,23,129,22,10,2014,2014-10-22,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer With humor, Kristeen Knight explains why she values her cancer support group. “There’s only so many times my husband wants to hear about my arm pain,” she says. Support group members meet at the cancer center near Kristeen’s home in Auburn, Alabama to listen to each other and understand. At those sessions, “you get to put your problems on hold and deal with other people’s problems,” says Kristeen, who was 31 and had a toddler son when diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Still, she has trouble connecting with group members sometimes because, unlike her, most are older with grown children, well-established careers and some financial stability. “I wanted to see young breast cancer patients. I never really met anyone else…going through the same issues,” she says. The only young adult group she could find in Alabama was in Birmingham, 110 miles away. When Kristeen learned about Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Young Advocate Program, she applied. The program trains women to reach out to their communities. Kristeen signed up because she wanted to bring more breast cancer education to young people. “We have very different problems than other survivors,” she says. Delay, Then Challenges Kristeen was breastfeeding when she noticed blood in her milk. Lactation counselors and doctors treated her for what they thought was an infection. She was given antibiotics. A mammogram showed a mass, which the breast surgeon thought was an area of deep infection from breastfeeding. He put in a tube to drain it but found a tumor. It was stage IIIB, estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. Two weeks later, Kristeen chose to have a double mastectomy because she had large breasts and wanted smaller ones. The surgeon also said it would be easier to match two new breasts than reconstruct one to match the other. Kristeen later decided to have her uterus and ovaries removed to reduce estrogen and lower her risk of recurrence. With a college degree in social science, Kristeen hadn’t been working since her son’s birth. Before that, she had been a restaurant manager. The small savings she and her husband had was used up by doctors’ visits before her breast cancer diagnosis. She had no health insurance. She called her local hospital and was told about a program it had for underserved women. The program paid her mammogram and biopsy costs, and Medicaid covered the rest of her treatment bills. “Medicaid is a blessing and a curse,” she says, with a sigh. “It covered everything, but right now I can’t get a job or my husband can’t make too much more money because I won’t qualify for benefits anymore.” Medicaid covers her medical care and on-going therapy with an aromatase inhibitor and will cover her reconstruction. Kristeen thinks about going back to work, but she doesn’t want another restaurant management position due to the physical demands and lack of adequate insurance coverage, and because it’s not her field. “For me to get a job, it has to be a great career path job with great benefits,” she says. Graduate school might improve her prospects, but lingering side effects cause her to worry about making long-range plans. “You don’t know the next time you’re gonna get sick and have to put everything on hold,” she says. Training as a Young Advocate At the Young Advocate sessions, Kristeen connected with people like herself. “With the economic downturn, a lot of us are without jobs. Access to healthcare is very important for our generation,” she says. The program helped her learn that advocacy can mean taking small, personal steps within her community, such as giving people information about breast cancer or connecting them to resources. Kristeen came away from the program feeling supported, with new friendships. Kristeen started talking to more people in doctors’ offices, throughout her community and by phone. She shares her experiences and distributes helpful information at local events. She enjoys advocacy so much that she hopes to become a cancer survivorship counselor at a hospital. Family Support Kristeen’s mother and aunt took turns living with the young family during her treatment. Her sister helped on weekends, and cousins who had been out of touch stepped forward. Still, she worries about how her treatment might have affected her son. “My whole life before I got breast cancer was him,” she says. “I breastfed exclusively. I was home with him. We played together, went to the park together. Then I got sick and it took me away from him.” Married only for about two years at diagnosis, she gave her husband a way out. “Right after I had surgery, I asked him, ‘Do you want to leave? Because you didn’t sign on for all of this.’” “And he said, ‘Yes, I did sign on for it.’” Despite working nights, he took her to her treatment sessions and sat with her through each one. “He’s been awesome,” she says.

65,23,13,4,1,2016,2016-01-04,"For #MetsHear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Ishiuan Hargrove shares an entry from her CaringBridge blog about a near death experience in late November. Her entry focuses on the tug of war between the pain she experiences from brain metastases, and wanting to do and see more with her loved ones (and all of you). Journal#70 – I have a near-death experience Dear Family and Friends, I had a taste of what a near-death experience is like. It felt very strange. About twelve days ago, I woke up feeling like I was standing on top of a merry-go-round, not knowing what happened to my head, and had continuous vomiting. I knew there was something wrong in my head since I had my third stereotactic radio-brain surgery at NYU in late October. I’ve had metastatic brain tumors originating from my breast cancer since December last year. Severe headaches have been part of my life for a year. I have exhausted all the available drugs as part of continuing care so I know very well that I am living on “borrowed time.” This is the year where I have had four brain surgeries. Sometimes when I am alone, I wonder if I would know when my moment comes and I also wonder, what will it feel like? I ran through all kinds of scenarios in my head. I expect that I will know when that moment comes. As it turns out, my multiple brain metastases had slowly gone through my brain, and there were lots of blood vessels, some quickly, some slowly, leaking blood into my brain. I guess most people like me would slowly lose consciousness, rely heavily on good pain meds and slowly slip into a coma and die in a hospice settings. My husband drove an hour to take me to Tampa General Hospital’s ER, to one of the best teams of neurosurgeons in Florida. Upon reviewing my scans, I was immediately admitted to the Neuro-ICU right away. I really felt death close in on me; I didn’t want to continue to breathe. The pain was so great that it would be so much easier if I just stopped breathing. I expected my “moment” and I really felt the weight of my cancer journey over these past nine years. All the surgeries piled up on top of each other. It was as though this is my chance to take the exit. No more physical pain, I could rest and close my eyes forever. As we dropped our ten and twelve year-old boys to our friends and quickly said “good-bye”, suddenly, it hit me that I didn’t say my good-byes properly. I thought I used up all this body could offer. Did I have any juice left? Was I at the end of my life? Wait, was I ready? I might die peacefully in the arms of my beloved husband and this is more than many people could asked for. The chief neurosurgeon Dr. Harry Van Loveren came by to see me the next day. He told me the hospital’s neuro-tumor board was debating on whether to operate on me. However, he told me he would operate for me. He didn’t want to send me home to hospice, but he could not fix me permanently. He asked me, what would I like to do? I have been preparing to live a shorter life for the past couple years. Suddenly I felt greedy. I used to pray to live to see my fortieth birthday, and I’ve already had two bonus years; but this is not enough! I have a roundtrip ticket to Taiwan to see my mom in January 2016. This year, she was also diagnosed with breast cancer at age of 62 and I have not seen her yet since her treatment started. I want to use that ticket! At that moment in the ER, I began to feel like Humpty Dumpty. Perhaps I could be duct-taped temporarily, however long it could hold me together, before I finally hit the ground. Who knows. I begged Dr. Van Loveren to take a chance on me, to just let me do some traveling and told him that I know I will eventually expire on the road, but that’s way better than slipping away peacefully in a home-hospice environment. He said he saw a small candle left in me. The pain I felt after the surgery was so great everywhere and I remembered asking myself again, why not take an easy exit now? It would be so much easier NOT to open my eyes. Then I realized that I have worked so hard for the past 41 years to have this life, to establish my relationship with this world. What a waste if I just quit now! My heartache would be so much greater if those who I love would have to wake up every day knowing I am gone. They would have to deal with their emotions for many years, but I just need to endure this extra physical pain for a couple of weeks. I saw the look in my husband’s eyes; it was the kind of compassion a human has looking at an injured animal and wanting them to stop suffering. I was very pissed off! I do not want him to want my suffering to stop. I want him to want me to stick around to ask him to help me, to continue to interact with me, to raise our sons together, to experience life with me no matter how much pain there might be for both of us. I want him to ask me to suffer for his sake and I want him to be as angry as hell as I am, not filled with grief to my end. I don’t know if after I die I will be in a “better place?” I have always believed we, with our fellow kindred-spirits, could create heaven here on this earth. There is no other “better place” I would rather be. I love this world I live in and I love all my friends and family. I want to be part of the heaven that we create together. So far I have only put 41 years of life into it, but I am greedy and I want to do more….. So with the great pain of an aching heart, I decided to open my eyes and feel every single pain in my body, but I feel alive! The pain reminds me this is my choice. I know it was not my time, because I choose to burn my candle more, to aggravate more people, to voice my opinions more, to continue to build a heaven here on earth. I felt very strong and positive energy coming toward me from all over the universe, from all different sources and I have felt so much LOVE from so many sources that were unfamiliar to me. I think the LOVE and CARE from all other human being (many I do not even know) brought me back to life. You made me want to continue to exist. This was the most painful and most beautiful sensation I have ever experienced. As I am now trying to pull words from my extremely muggy head, I need to send this out to all of you who send me this energy. Human beings have this enormous potential to keep each other alive – believe it! We are all in this world together. We can carry each other; we can be each other’s miracles. I am going to live my Humpty Dumpty life for now, as long as it serves some purpose. I know very well my cancer is a time bomb, my brain tissues are paper-thin, and from any slight touch my brain could hemorrhage to death. My new life from this point needs to be a balance between LOVE and physical pain. I thought my cancer had taken almost everything from me, but all of you who are reading my journals have put your support, love, heart and hope back into this broken body. I thank each one of you for being part of my life. Let us continue to build heaven here on earth together! Love and Merry Christmas, Ishiuan Ishiuan Hargrove, 42, is a medical physicist and CEO of her own consulting company, Hargrove Consulting Physics. Ishiuan developed a passion for cancer advocacy and research after her initial breast cancer diagnosis 12 years ago. She was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2013.

66,23,130,20,10,2014,2014-10-20,"Today we would like to introduce Dana Donofree, LBBC friend and supporter but first time LBBC blogger! Dana’s story will span three blog posts as she shares her story and how her breast cancer journey impacted her life and career so be sure to check back to learn more! In the weeks leading up to my 28th birthday, cancer was the absolute last thing on my mind. I was, after all, putting together the last-minute preparations for my wedding and planning a trip back home to Ohio for my bridal shower. My career in fashion was taking off, and I was starting to realize how happy and lucky I was. Plus, I was young, taking care of myself and doing all the “right,” healthy things I would read about. Oddly after several conversations with my best friend and sister about finding lumps in their breasts, that turned out to be benign, I guess you could say I must have had a heightened awareness to checking my breasts. It dawned on me that I too should do a self exam, but I didn’t, I had just been to my annual check up and if there was something there the doctor would find it, right? Well, it wasn’t until one day in the shower, when my wrist brushed against my armpit…yes, my armpit, that I even noticed a lump. After the initial shock of finding it, I sort of shrugged it off. My friend’s turned out to be nothing. I was going to be fine, too. Only I wasn’t. The day before my birthday, surrounded by family, friends and bridesmaids I got the news. Invasive ductal carcinoma. Triple positive. I was staring down multiple surgeries, chemo (!) and all of the what-ifs that come along with the cancer. Everything in my life changed that day. Obviously, my first move was to get ready for the grueling treatment and make sure I was in the best shape as possible. I was after all training for my wedding day and eating healthy and working out. I continued working my design job and tried not let cancer run my life. The May wedding got postponed, but my fiance, Paul, remained by my side throughout the whole ordeal. I got a bilateral mastectomy, spacers, reconstruction (though I opted out of nipple reconstruction). I played through the pain, I weathered the darkest moments the best I could, and I got myself involved with young survivor support groups. Those groups were vital to my well-being. They helped me realize I wasn’t the only 20-something losing my breasts to this awful disease. They made me laugh, held my hand through the down days when I was feeling anything but beautiful and they helped me understand all of my emotions and the chemo side effects. It became such a part of my existence, I made it a point, once I recovered, to stop any woman I spotted sporting a headscarf, hear her story and pass along words of encouragement. They are also the reason why I am so supportive of organizations like Living Beyond Breast Cancer.

Young mothers living with metastatic breast cancer face unique hurdles and uncertainty. Terri da Silva provides insight on these issues and shares resources and tips for supporting your family while living with this diagnosis. Living with breast cancer is tough. It’s especially difficult when you’re a young woman trying to navigate your way through adulthood, building a career, starting a family, and then you find out you have metastatic breast cancer. The kind that rarely goes away. The kind that requires lifelong treatment. The kind that is terminal. I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2011 at the age of 37 when my daughter was only 2 years old. I had no previous breast cancer scares. No family history. I was otherwise healthy. Suddenly my life was flipped upside down. Young moms with metastatic breast cancer face a unique set of hurdles. Unlike most breast cancer patients whose treatment has a prescribed end date, those of us with stage IV metastatic disease live our lives going from one treatment to the next. Praying the treatments will slow down or stop the progression of our disease long enough so we can see our kids learn how to ride a bike, go on their first date, graduate from school. Praying the side effects from our treatment won’t cause us to miss soccer games and parent-teacher nights. Praying our loved ones won’t tire of supporting us year after year after year. Praying for the strength to make the most of each day we are still here. Continue reading →",0,1,0.13773216031280547
68,23,132,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"LBBC Board Member Amy Lessack writes about how she manages her emotions before and after she gets scans. “You must be freaked out every time you get a scan and have to see the doctor.” If you are a breast cancer survivor or someone living with metastatic breast cancer, this is something that well-meaning people say because they probably don’t know what to say. The obvious answer is, of course, I am concerned and worried. You pray to whomever, whatever to get the clean scan and the OK from the doctor that you are good for 6 months, a year, or even more. No one ever asked for breast cancer. I certainly DID NOT invite it in my life, and it needs to go. However, that is not my journey. I continue to be on the roller coaster of vacillating between the 3-month and 6-month of scans and back to 3-months. So how do I handle it, manage my emotions and get through it? I get through using the following seven steps before every scan: #1 I had to make a conscious choice – “scans are my friend.” Why are they my friend? Because they are the only things that can “see inside my body” and help the doctors and me cheer when things look good, and research or make a plan when or if necessary. #2 I now schedule my scans on Mondays and doctor appointments the Friday after the scan. This is so that I don’t have to wait to hear the results knowing that it takes 2 – 3 days to get them. Continue reading →",0,1,0.2567460317460317
69,23,133,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"Scott Cotlar writes about living by common clichés for people affected by metastatic breast cancer. When I was first diagnosed with metastatic male breast cancer, I was not prepared to make any major changes in my life. There were just a few small lesions in my lungs. I was fully functional, working full-time as an attorney and had no interest in changing my daily routine. That was about 6 years ago. Fast forward to today – lesions in my lung are “too numerous to count” according to the radiologist’s report; 5 bouts of gamma knife radiation of the brain for a total of 13 lesions treated; radiation to most of my spine; and now large metastatic lesions in my liver. Even with all of this, my good quality of life did not change until…a lesion on my tibia (a bone between the knee and the ankle) gave me an “elevated risk for fracture,” requiring that I wear a leg brace and walk with a cane. The lesion to my tibia was the game changer. All of a sudden, my quality of life was deeply affected: the simple act of walking was no longer quite so simple. I felt an urgent need to “get my affairs in order.” As I write this blog I am preparing for chemotherapy, which I have done my best to avoid for the past 6 years, taking advantage of any hormonal or targeted therapy that I could get my hands on. I am finally starting to feel like a “real cancer patient.” Continue reading →",0,1,0.07849025974025975
70,23,134,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"Julie Gralow, MD, blogs about the advances we’ve experienced in treating and managing one subtype of metastatic breast cancer, and calls for more support in research and care for people affected by the disease worldwide. Substantial advances have occurred in the field of breast cancer during the 20 years I’ve been caring for people diagnosed with metastatic disease. I had a chance to reflect on this last month, when I saw a woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer whose sister had also been a patient of mine. The sister died of metastatic breast cancer in 1995 at the age of 35. There were few effective treatments at that time, and despite access to state-of-the art care and enrollment in a clinical trial, her survival following recurrence was short. My current patient accompanied her sister to many of those last clinic visits. Memories of those visits were prominent in her mind when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014, at the age of 47, and became a patient herself. Both sisters were diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer, but there were no approved HER2-targeted therapies in 1995. In 2014, there are four approved therapies and others in development. What used to be an aggressive type of breast cancer with a poor prognosis has now become much more treatable and survivable. This woman’s outlook is tremendously hopeful. Thanks to the Human Genome Project, we no longer think of breast cancer as a single entity, or its treatment as “one-size-fits-all.” Our increasing understanding of cancer genomics has revealed multiple subsets of breast cancer with different behavior patterns and different responses to therapy. Dozens of new agents have been approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the past two decades, offering meaningful improvements in the likelihood of response and length of survival.

71,23,135,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"Serenity Kisling blogs about navigating her relationships, her strong faith and being declared no evidence of disease. As I write, it’s the first day of 2014’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I’ll be honest: now that I’ve been declared NED (no evidence of disease), I don’t want to watch the Today show’s #PinkPower, or think about cancer. I am so traumatized by the last 7 years, and wondering if I was going to see my son’s third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh birthdays. However, I want to reflect on my journey. Despite what I have experienced with my health and my family, I got through this journey with metastatic breast cancer through faith, laughter and by living my life. First, let me say that the breast cancer journey sucks, no matter if you are lesbian or straight. I was initially diagnosed with stage III ER/PR-positive breast cancer in 2008, at age 35. I had a 2-year-old son and a different partner at the time. At that point, my relationship with my partner was rocky, and she was not very emotionally supportive while I had breast cancer. She had no idea what I was going through: being bald from chemo, becoming so sick because of the chemo that I could not drink or eat anything, ending up neutropenic, dehydrated and in the hospital for a week and developing pneumonia. In 2009, my then-partner and I celebrated when oncologists declared me in remission. We thought life would go back to normal and not the “new normal” commonly associated with post-treatment — just “normal,” period. It seemed like I was better after finishing treatment. I even went back to my hardcore workouts. But then I started feeling fatigue, and with that came insomnia. Life became miserable for various reasons, and I decided to divorce my partner. It was the hardest decision I have had to make thus far in my life. Through all of this, maintaining my positivity (though hard at times) and my faith got me through this major life change. Something that made me depressed was that the oncologist who declared I was in remission did not discuss preserving my fertility before I proceeded with chemotherapy, and now it’s too late. I had been in survival mode, I had a beautiful son, and having another child hadn’t crossed my mind. I wish now I had frozen my eggs. I would have loved for my wife to carry my child. Even though I live with this regret, I have come to realize that it may not have been meant to be, and I must accept this and cherish my one beautiful son. Continue reading →",0,1,0.1165473007384772
73,23,137,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"Ann Silberman wants readers to think critically and fund research to help people with metastatic breast cancer reach their goals and milestones. It seemed slightly odd to be asked to write for a website called “Living Beyond Breast Cancer” when, as a woman with metastatic breast cancer, it is only my family who will live beyond cancer. I will merely live with breast cancer until it kills me. But so much of Pink October has so little to do with those of us who are metastatic that I agreed that our metastatic voices need to be heard this month. In 2009, I was diagnosed with Stage IIA HER2-positive breast cancer. I did the normal treatment for my diagnosis; mastectomy first, then “TCH” which is 6 rounds of Taxotere and Carboplatin and a year of Herceptin. I cried the night before I lost my breast, I smiled as the nurses handed me my chemo graduation certificate, and my last Herceptin treatment brought great relief. My year of endurance had ended and now I could get fully back to my life. At my very first 3 month post-treatment appointment, my doctor sent me for a scan, which brought the devastating news: breast cancer had spread to my liver. My cancer is now incurable. And so I did as we all do – I searched for survival statistics, read stories of struggle and death, and learned acceptance. I figured out how to live with a terminal illness (and was not always graceful about it). Finally, I set a goal: I would see my son graduate from high school. Over the course of the next three years, I was sicker than I ever thought anybody could be, but my doctor did not give up on me, and I did not give up on trying for my son. I had half my liver removed in an effort to eradicate the liver mets, only to find they grew right back. I nearly died from c-diff sepsis that landed me in the ICU and then left me recovering at home, weak and sick, for months. I struggled through 7 different chemotherapy drugs, each with their own side effects, until my marrow would no longer recover and my immune system was gone. I did SBRT radiation on the mets that continued to mutate. And, finally, I was put on Perjeta, which I call my miracle. My mets disappeared into the ether and in May of 2014, I not only watched my Valedictorian son walk with his high school class, but also this September I took him to his college, Caltech, settled him in, and even made his dorm room bed. Despite the odds, I reached my goal. Continue reading →",0,1,0.024402533740769037
74,23,138,13,10,2014,2014-10-13,"Sheila Johnson-Glover blogs about the importance of discussing breast cancer in the African-American community and recognizing people who are living with metastatic breast cancer. When people hear I have stage IV breast cancer, I wonder if they automatically think I’m going to die. No one has ever said that to me, but I still wonder this sometimes. I am a stage IV breast cancer survivor, and I’m proud to say that, because after 5 years, I’m still striving and thriving. I want people to not immediately think of metastatic disease as a death sentence. I want people to understand I still fight just as hard as people with stage I, II or III breast cancer. And as long as researchers continue to develop new medicines, we still have HOPE. I was diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer in September 2009 while I was still on active duty in the military. When my doctor told me I had stage IV cancer, I asked, “How many stages are there?” She said, “Sheila, you have the top one.” Is stage IV breast cancer really a death sentence? My answer would be NO. Still, when I found out I had metastatic breast cancer, my first thought was to ask God, “Am I going to die?” As the years passed, there have been so many different targeted therapies that have been approved for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The advances in medicine have had a huge impact on my survivorship: I’m currently on Herceptin and Faslodex, and these two medicines have been working amazingly for me. My mother died of stage IV breast cancer in August 2004, and I wish I would have known more about the disease then. I wish she had had the medicines that I’ve been on these past couple of years – maybe she would have lived longer. I’ve met so many amazing women with metastatic breast cancer and their journeys are truly amazing, as amazing as anyone diagnosed with this disease. However, as an African-American stage IV breast cancer survivor, I haven’t met many other African-American women with this diagnosis. When my mother faced this disease, cancer was not talked about too much in our community. It goes to show that it’s a subject that needs to be addressed and discussed in the African-American community. For African-American women, our mortality rate from breast cancer is much higher than it is for any other races. We need to talk about it. Continue reading →",0,1,0.23684062850729518

Discover the inspiration Annie provided to family, friends and others living with MBC in the post below. Maybe it’s all in my head. I can’t have brain tumors. Maybe I’m just depressed and need psychiatric help. After discovering a lump, I was diagnosed with stage IIB triple-negative breast cancer on February 29, 2012. I was 30 years old with no family history of cancer. I had a mastectomy, reconstruction, four rounds of Adriamycin and Cytoxan and 12 rounds of Abraxane chemotherapy. While in treatment, I found out I had the BRCA1 mutation. On November 30, 2012, I finished radiation and my doctor declared I was in remission. I went back to normal life. I enjoyed having a healthy appetite again. My hair grew back. I went back to work full-time. Having cancer was no longer all I could think about. It started to become a memory, and I loved life as a survivor. Due to the BRCA1 mutation, I had to go for ultrasounds of my ovaries every six months. My first screening was perfect. In November 2013, I went for my second ultrasound, and as soon as I got into work, my doctor’s office called: I needed to come in immediately. My right ovary was 11 cm. A normal ovary is 3 cm.

76,23,14,22,12,2015,2015-12-22,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer Reviewed By Anees B. Chagpar, MD, MSc, MPH The rash on Christina Ihfe’s left nipple was as stubborn as it was painful. Her doctor diagnosed it as a fungal infection and recommended a variety of creams and medicines over 6 months. Still, the rash wasn’t healing. Christina, then 33, had a busy job selling data equipment. Her work involved lots of cross-country traveling. The rash caused extremely sharp pain that interfered with her job and she was fired for missing so much time. Two weeks later, to figure out what the rash was, Christina’s doctor sent her for a nipple biopsy. The biopsy surgeon told her she had Paget disease, without really explaining what that meant. “When they tell you it’s a disease and they’re not using the ‘C’ word, it doesn’t sound so bad,” Christina says. She looked up Paget disease online. “I then started asking questions, [and freaked out] a little bit,” she says. She lives in Windsor, Colorado, a town with about 20,000 residents. “Nobody around here had even heard of it.” A Rare Diagnosis Paget disease of the breast, sometimes called Paget’s disease, is a rare form of breast cancer. It affects the nipple skin and, often, the areola, the darker area around the nipple. It may cause the nipple to flatten, and itching, redness, yellow discharge or flaking or crusting of the skin on the nipple. As in Christina’s situation, Paget disease symptoms can be mistaken for benign skin problems, which delays correct diagnosis. In Paget disease, breast cancer cells travel from a tumor in the breast into the skin. About 1 to 4 percent of all breast cancers involve Paget disease. How it develops is not clearly understood. Other types of Paget disease occur elsewhere and are not related. Christina was diagnosed with stage III, hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer. Because she had large breasts and she could not have reconstruction to match that size, she decided to have a double mastectomy and reconstruction with implants so that her breasts would be equal in size, although smaller. “That was another hard thing to take, knowing I could never be what I was,” she says. Treatment Problems After surgery, Christina had 15 rounds of chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab [Herceptin], a HER2 targeted therapy. At the same time, she received leuprolide (Lupron) to suppress ovarian function. She had joint pain in her hips, knees and shoulders but couldn’t tell which medicine was causing it. “It was so painful I wasn’t able to go up and down stairs in my house,” she says. An infection in her surgical drains resulted in removal of her left breast implant. Her plastic surgeon said Christina would have to delay further reconstruction until after her 32 radiation sessions. In all, it took 8 surgeries to complete her reconstruction. Christina’s experience was tough on her 13-year-old son, who was accustomed to her being active. “It was quite a difficult time for him,” she says, “although he was always helpful.” She also gained support from her boyfriend, who was “the driver, the listener, the everything.” Looking Ahead While struggling with the impact of treatment, Christina was unable to work. She collected unemployment compensation for a short time, then used her savings, which dwindled quickly. When her doctors said she couldn’t work for some time, she applied for disability benefits but was denied. Two years later, she’s still trying to get a hearing to appeal her case. She looked for emotional support locally but felt out of place in a breast cancer support group comprised of well-meaning but older women. Christina found LBBC online and became interested in sharing its resources with younger women in her area. She attended LBBC’s Young Advocate training and stays connected with others she met there. “Whatever kind of day you’re having, they understand,” she says. She appreciated hearing about work, insurance and finances at the training from Triage Cancer and wants to include those issues in her advocacy efforts. Christina now focuses on survivorship – her own and that of other young women. She brings LBBC materials to local events and talks to people. Her message, she says, is for young women to listen to their bodies and be heard. “For 6 months, I knew something wasn’t right and I kept going until I got an answer,” she says. “You have to be responsible to take care of yourself.” This article was supported by the Grant or Cooperative Agreement Number 1 U58 DP005403, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Julie Larson, LCSW, developed this list of tips and ideas to help smooth the ride. The weight in the room is palpable, thick with uncertainty and fear. Later I hear undeniable hope and the unmistakable clear tone of renewed perspective. Tears swell close to the surface during intimate conversations and the roar of laughter is a quick partner to humility and grace. This is the roller coaster of emotions that inevitably accompanies a cancer diagnosis, including metastatic breast cancer. Fear, worry and uncertainty woven together with hope, renewed perspective and gratitude. Experiencing the extreme shifts is often startling and unfamiliar to many affected by metastatic disease. Yet, most of those living with metastatic breast cancer (and their loved ones) have been affected by the ride. Often it is helpful to know these emotional ups and downs are normal. You are not alone. After all, a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis is a life-changing experience. Treatment alone often demands changes in your daily routine, shifts in professional goals and physical losses which can be challenging to reconcile. “Why me” questions and the uncertainty about the future can be overwhelming.

78,23,15,14,12,2015,2015-12-14,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer Sarah Iwanski, of Pooler, Georgia, is proud of her reputation as a squeaky wheel. “I squeak a lot until people hear me,” she says. That skill has served her well since early 2013, shortly after her second child was born. Sarah, who has a genetic blood disorder known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or HHT, was sent for a chest scan. Her doctors wanted to make sure the pregnancy hadn’t caused HHT-related lung problems. The test showed her lungs were fine. The radiologist noted one lymph node was barely enlarged and told her it was nothing to worry about. Sarah, who was 29 and breast-feeding an infant, then went to her obstetrician/gynecologist. She was sent for an ultrasound that found the node was probably benign. Still, Sarah was not satisfied. Because she was a medical technologist at a local hospital, she consulted an oncologist she knew. He didn’t think the node was a problem, either, but agreed to send her for a biopsy. It showed what no doctor had detected: Sarah had stage IIIA breast cancer. The disease was in her milk ducts but hadn’t formed a tumor that could be felt, especially in a nursing mother’s breast. “If I [had not questioned] my healthcare providers and advocate[d] for myself, then I probably would not be alive now,” says Sarah. “I have a medical background and worked in a hospital. Women without that experience and without confidence to challenge their doctors are at a severe disadvantage.” Joining Clinical Trials Sarah was diagnosed with hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer. She had a mastectomy, chemotherapy, trastuzumab (Herceptin) for a year and 30 rounds of radiation. She also set out to find clinical trials for further treatment because there are no long-term treatments for the type of disease she has. “The more clinical trials I can find, the more [I feel] I’m actively doing [something] to stick around,” she says. She thought a vaccine therapy trial could benefit her, so searched online at breastcancertrials.org and clinicaltrials.org. Vaccine therapies are treatments that stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells. After finishing trastuzumab and radiation, and while undergoing reconstructive surgeries, Sarah joined a trial for a vaccine that might work against HER2. The trial site was in Virginia, an 8-hour drive from her home. She made the trip for an initial exam and then 12 more times over a 3-month period, to receive the vaccine. Because it was a phase 1 clinical trial, everyone in it received the vaccine. The treatment ingredients had been separately tested through phase 3 trials. Each time she got the vaccine “it made me feel like I had the flu for a day,” she says. The trial has not yet reported results. The trial covered costs for the vaccine and related lab work. Her final visit was not covered, and was out-of-network for her insurance, so she paid about $1,000-$1,500 for that. She had help with hotel expenses from an American Cancer Society program. She participated in other clinical trials as well. Earlier, while receiving trastuzumab, Sarah was in a study testing heart medicine in women taking trastuzumab, which may cause heart problems. Neither she nor the researchers know whether she received a medicine or placebo, an inactive substance. “I will never know until years from now what I got, but I didn’t have heart damage (from treatment),” Sarah says. She and her family also participated in a study of genetic factors related to breast cancer in women younger than 40 when diagnosed. The study, which is still open, collects blood samples from young women living anywhere in the U.S., as well as from their siblings and parents. Helping Other Georgia Women Sarah has lymphedema from surgery, range-of-motion problems from radiation scarring and neuropathy from chemotherapy. Spurred by her squeaky-wheel nature and her own experiences, she became passionate about survivorship concerns. She felt support was missing outside of hospital networks in Georgia and met other survivors who agreed with her. “We needed an outlet to not sit in a hospital and talk about being sick, but to have fun with women who understood what we were experiencing,” she says. With a few other women, she co-founded Surviving Sisters, a nonprofit focused on nine underserved counties in coastal Georgia. The organization has peer navigators, a website with a directory of support resources and a private Facebook group. The group works with rural hospitals to connect survivors with services and holds social activities, such as picnics, beach days and retreats. Because of her ongoing side effects and medical needs, Sarah could not return to her previous job and receives disability benefits. She became a certified patient navigator and volunteers helping others get through breast cancer treatment. She also serves as treasurer of Surviving Sisters. “I loved my old job, but I look at it as breast cancer was for a reason. There has to be something I can do with it,” she says. “Survivorship is a big need.” This article was supported by the Grant or Cooperative Agreement Number 1 U58 DP005403, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

79,23,16,7,12,2015,2015-12-07,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer Reviewed By Minetta C. Liu, MD On the day she was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer, also known as IBC, Patrice Starks, of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, had never heard of the disease. Like many people, she thought all breast cancer formed as a lump that could be felt by touch or seen on a mammogram. Having just turned 41 years old, Patrice had her first mammogram a few months before and was told all was fine. When her left breast began to hurt and swell, she thought she had an infection, like the one she experienced when breastfeeding her daughter. Finding out the real source of her breast discomfort “was completely shocking,” Patrice says – especially the aggressive nature of the type she had. “One of the things that troubled me most was the lack of knowledge on my part – and in the world – about IBC. Even most of the doctors I see don’t know much about it,” she says. Taking Action IBC often makes no lump. The cancer cells block lymph vessels, which makes the breast swollen and red. Affected breasts may feel warm or heavy, look bruised, or have skin ridges or pits, like an orange. Only 5 percent or fewer of all breast cancers in the U.S. are diagnosed as IBC. It is staged as stage III or more. Because symptoms resemble other medical conditions, such as skin rashes or mastitis, a common breast infection, diagnosis may be delayed. A timely diagnosis of IBC is important because breast-related changes and discomfort may develop quickly. Patrice was diagnosed with stage III, estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, HER2-positive disease. She received her diagnosis on a saw an oncologist on then spent the rest of the week being readied for chemotherapy, which started the following week. “You don’t have time to figure out your life,” she says. She was working 50 hours or more per week, having just been promoted to a deputy supervisor job for Florida’s juvenile justice programs. Scheduled to go on a business trip that week, she called her boss and cancelled the trip right after getting her diagnosis. “I had to work on making sure I became healthy enough to remain a wife, remain a mother, remain a co-worker,” she says. “My job description went from working for the state of Florida to working for Patrice.” She was especially concerned about how her diagnosis would affect her young children: a 20-month-old daughter and 3-year-old son, who has autism and doesn’t speak. “He’s very perceptive in understanding emotions, so I told the two of them that Mommy’s sick and she has a boo-boo.” Her son responded by putting his hand on her breast. “I said, ‘Yes, Mommy has a boo-boo.’” When her hair began to fall out from chemotherapy, her husband shaved her head. Their daughter sat in Patrice’s lap, fascinated by the dropping hair, as their son ran around, laughing. “It was fine,” she says. “They don’t understand cancer, and I’m glad.” Coping With Fatigue Patrice had chemotherapy, trastuzumab (Herceptin) and then a mastectomy and radiation. She has experienced a lot of fatigue since treatment began. She can be having a conversation, then wake up three hours later, having fallen asleep without knowing it. She gets up with the children and prepares them for day care. Her husband drives them while Patrice grabs a nap. Her mother, who is retired, helps with the laundry, drives Patrice to appointments and errands, and assists when the kids are home. Patrice bathes her daughter and son because “I didn’t want to change their routine. I wanted to still be their mother.” She hopes the end of radiation treatment will lessen her tiredness. Her healthcare team advised her to walk. “They said any bit of exercise will give you more energy.” Before breast cancer, she exercised twice a week and could walk a mile in 15 or 20 minutes. Recently, for a fundraising relay, she walked 2 miles in 2.5 hours. When she woke up the next day, she stayed awake for only a short time, and then slept another 6 to 8 hours more. “You don’t even realize how tired you are until it hits you,” she says. When she has energy in the evenings, she puts the children in their stroller and walks about a mile in the family’s neighborhood. Spreading the Word Patrice has been on a personal campaign to tell more people about IBC. When her doctor’s office asked if she would talk with a woman who had just been diagnosed, she agreed immediately. “I want as many people to know as much about this as possible,” she says. As an African-American, she is also concerned about the lack of awareness about IBC she sees among African-Americans, who are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease at a younger age than white women. All women should follow appropriate screening guidelines. “I tell all of my friends, you have to do your monthly checks of your breast. I realized there were some changes in my breast as it was growing and growing, but I didn’t take the time from work and go to the doctor like I should have,” Patrice says. Now she has a message for others: “Be sure you go to the doctor if there’s an issue.” This article was supported by the Grant or Cooperative Agreement Number 1 U58 DP005403, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

80,23,17,3,12,2015,2015-12-03,"Have you heard the news? Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s annual yoga fundraiser has a new name! What has grown into our largest event began in 2002 with less than 100 people practicing yoga in the rain on the steps of the iconic steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. I can still remember standing on the steps with event co-founder and yoga instructor Jennifer Schelter. We promised we’d be back every year on the third Sunday in May. We’ve kept that promise along with thousands of our participants. In fact, more than 2,300 people participated in the Philadelphia event in 2015. The event has also expanded into other cities including Washington, D.C., Kansas City, Denver and Fort Myers. This isn’t the first time the event was renamed. In the early years it was “Yoga Unites for Living Beyond Breast Cancer” and for a short time “Yoga 4 Living Beyond Breast Cancer;” three years ago it changed to “Yoga on the Steps.” We know that many will still think of the event as that but we wanted a name that reflects more of what makes the event so special and inspires people to participate year after year. So through interviews with past participants, staff and a national survey, we learned a lot. Here is some of what they told us: The event is much more than an outdoor yoga class. It’s a morning of inspiration, connection and community that gives participants an opportunity to celebrate, reconnect, remember and honor in an intimate setting. Participants also told us that the yoga event is about support – supporting others while also receiving support – all while giving back to Living Beyond Breast Cancer through grassroots fundraising. “I participated in Denver, Fall 2015 for the first time. It was a truly amazing experience to do yoga outside in such a supportive, connected community; the practitioners leading and assisting were gentle and strong, as was the vibe of the whole event. I’m planning to bring my daughter with me to Philadelphia next year.” – Amy R. We absolutely agree with these sentiments, as we witness the same at each and every yoga event year after year. The event is special to us, we have nurtured it, and we’re thrilled that it’s just as special to you. So without further ado, our new yoga fundraiser name is… Reach – we chose this name to represent reaching out to friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors to be part of the event, reaching the communities that we serve and reaching your goals – both on an individual and team level. Raise – you raise up those who have been affected by breast cancer and need your support, you raise awareness about the effects of breast cancer and you raise critical dollars that help Living Beyond Breast Cancer create and implement programs and services to help those dealing with breast cancer. We hope that you appreciate the time and thought that went into creating the new name. And don’t forget to mark your calendars! Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Reach & Raise takes place in Philadelphia on May 15, 2016! Jean A. Sachs, MSS, MLSP Chief Executive Officer",0,1,0.19818869193869196
81,23,18,30,11,2015,2015-11-30,"As National Family Caregivers Month comes to a close, Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Community Engagement Manager Lynn Folkman reflects on the care, support and love she received from her family. I view caregiving as a way to give and receive love. A few months before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was one of my mom’s primary caregivers. When people ask me about caregiving, I always say it was one of the hardest things I have ever done and also one of the most rewarding things I have ever done; and I would not have wanted it any other way. Yet, when the tables turned and I became the patient, it was hard for me to accept being the one who needed care. However, those who love you fiercely jump into the role of caregiving without hesitation. Last year, I wrote about my “rock star” caregiver, my sister Deb. I hope that everyone has a caregiver such as my sister. I was also fortunate to have the full support of my sister’s family. They were the ones that supported my sister when she needed to rejuvenate from her caregiving role. As they supported her, she in turn could support me. However, they did not stop there, they too supported and loved me fiercely with their own acts of caregiving. I was single at the time of diagnosis and I was scared. I never regretted my life choices, but with a cancer diagnosis, I really felt alone. I was not sure how I was going to do it all, work full time and keep my home afloat all while going through treatment. I was afraid and so many thoughts crossed my mind, would I be able to have the energy to work, could I afford to keep my house, how could I go through this alone, so many unknowns and so many questions swirled inside of me. It took an illness to shine a light on what had been my truth: I had a loving family by my side. I was always close with my sister’s family; my brother-in-law Jerry was more like a brother to me, my nephew and niece, Josh and Julie, were like the children I never had. I often took family vacations with them and for a time I lived with them as well. I was there for all the celebrations of the family and the kids growing up, birthdays, bar and bat mitzvahs and Sunday dinners. During my diagnosis and treatment I leaned on them all just a little bit more than usual; and in the process of allowing them to care for me brought me even to closer to all of them. They each gave in different ways. No matter their approach to caregiving, it provided me a sense of calm, peace and security. Their gestures of kindness and caregiving, big or small, added to my healing and showed me how deeply loved I was. It just so happened that my brother in law outfitted the chemotherapy infusion chairs in the healthcare facility where I was being treated. I know, weird huh, what are the chances? To ease my mind and comfort before I began my treatments, he arranged for a private tour for me to walk through the infusion rooms. Just a small gesture and yet seeing where I would be treated, put my mind at ease. Jerry was there every step from beginning to end as my cheerleader. He experienced every high and low along with me. My nephew Josh would call me after treatments, checking in on me. When I finished my last Herceptin treatment, he called me with enthusiastic congratulations. Just to hear his smiling voice and yes feel his love on the other end of the phone made me power through my treatments. If he was scared, he never let on. Every time that I saw him, he was always at the ready to give me one of the biggest loving hugs around letting me know in his own way that he would be by my side and love me through whatever showed up in my life. My niece Julie was studying abroad during her last semester before graduation. She sent me a card that I still have to this day, which on the front has a cartoon picture of a fuzzy sheep and says “Ewe Are My Sunshine!” Inside the card reads, “Dear Lynn, Even though skies might be grey right now, you still shine brighter than the sun. Your sunny disposition is your greatest asset (aside from your fashion sense!). I love you, Julie”. That card hung in my house (and still does) in a location that I would walk by everyday. It served to remind me daily that I was still the same person inside and her Aunt, which she very much loved. Before I started chemotherapy, we all piled into the car, Deb, Jerry and Josh to drive to Penn State to see Julie graduate from college. Although, I was tired from just having completed surgery and slept in the car most of the ride, it was a wonderful day. I was so proud of my niece and so thankful to be part of this loving family. The day and the moment provided me a sense of normalcy away from appointments, tests and doctors. It re-framed my present moment. Sure, I have breast cancer and I was just about to begin chemotherapy, but these joyful moments and their loving gestures served to remind me who I was deep inside that cancer could not take away. I spent a great deal of time at their home, especially during the exhausting times of treatment. They would make sure that I would eat, and rest, but most importantly they fed and bolstered my spirit emotionally. I would often thank my brother in law for being so kind, he would respond, without a second thought, “of course that is what you do for family”, in his mind there was no other option but to give, support and love. This concept on the surface seems simplistic, and yet somehow can become complicated to implement throughout life. If we all applied this simple rule and to have the attitude and the mindset, of course you give of yourself, of course you give of your time, indeed the world would be a much more loving place. Thank you Jerry, Josh and Julie for supporting Deb while she cared for me. Thank you for believing in me and loving me fiercely even when my light felt dimmed by life’s circumstances. Your love changed my life and continues to do so. The saying goes that you can choose your friends, but not your family. I have to say in this case, I could not choose any better than those who I have the pleasure and honor to call family.

82,23,19,13,11,2015,2015-11-13,"AILLEA founder Kathryn Dickinson discusses how to navigate toxin-free beauty. Read on to learn about the chemicals found in everyday beauty products as well as learn about a special giveaway we’re holding with AILLEA. For more information about environmental health, check out these resources from our August 2015 webinar. Did you know that women put an average of 168 chemicals on their body a day? Our skin is our largest organ and absorbs 60% of everything we put on it directly in to our blood stream (think about how hormone or nicotine transdermal patches work!). There are over 10,000 chemicals being used in our personal care products and even more shocking – one in five personal care products have ingredients that may be linked to cancer! This makes navigating the beauty aisle can be daunting and overwhelming. Below is a list of the cosmetic version of the “Dirty Dozen” – top 12 chemicals used in cosmetic and beauty products that you should consider avoiding. I’ve summarized them for you, but before it gets too scary, know that all products at AILLEA, in addition to being high-performing, are safe and toxin-free. Added bonus: if you use the code LBBC at checkout you get a 5% discount and we make a donation to Living Beyond Breast Cancer. So get your products (and your trash) ready and read on to see which harmful chemicals are in your beauty cabinet: BHA and BHT – Butylated Hydroxyanisole and Butylated Hydroxytoluene (tip off right there if you can’t pronounce the ingredient). These are commonly found in moisturizers and other cosmetics as a preservative. They can disrupt hormone function and can cause skin allergies, and also have been linked to kidney and thyroid problems. Coal tar dyes (p-phenylenediamine), toluene, hydroquinone, and phenol carbolic acid – These just sound disgusting. They’re also among the few products for which the Food and Drug Administration have issued consumer advice on the benefits of reducing use. These are found in skin lotions, anti-aging creams, hair dyes and other skin and hair products. DEA and related ingredients like MEA, TEA – These are used to make shampoos, soaps, and other products creamy and foamy. They are also used in oil refineries to remove hydrogen sulphide from process gas emissions. Are you sure your hair is THAT dirty? These are skin and eye irritants, have been linked to liver cancer, and have been declared toxic for the environment and for aquatic organisms. Save Nemo and stop washing these down the drain! Dibutyl phthalate – Use in nail polish as a “plasticizer” and in fragrance. This has also been banned in the EU, may be linked developmental defects, and increase the ability for other chemicals to cause genetic mutations. The worse part is that because it’s used in fragrance, some companies don’t have to list this in the ingredients because it’s part of their “secret recipe.” The secret is killing you isn’t it? Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives (DMDM hydantoin, ureas, methenamines, etc) – Just to start, formaldehyde is used to embalm a body to preserve it and reduce the speed of decomposition. If that doesn’t convince you, read on. It is a known carcinogen, can irritate the skin and eyes, and cause asthma and nausea. It’s used in hair straightening treatments and relaxers, baby shampoos, soaps, and many other cosmetics. It’s also used in toilet bowl cleaners…enough said. Parabens – These are the most widely used chemical in cosmetics so get ready to part ways with many of your beloved but harmful products. They alter hormone levels and may play a role in increasing one’s risk of developing breast cancer. Parfum (fragrance) – Just because the word is French doesn’t mean it’s elegant. This term actually includes about 3,000 chemicals and is used in perfumes, lotions, creams, and deodorants among other products. Of the 3,000 chemicals, most have not even been tested for toxicity. Those that have may cause allergies, asthma, irritate the skin, and have been linked to reproductive issues. PEG compounds – These are used to thicken and soften creams and lotions. They are also used as laxatives. Not something you usually want to put on your face. It may be listed as propylene glycol in the ingredients, and may cause harm to the nervous system, skin irritation, and organ and reproductive toxicity. It may be contaminated with measurable amounts of ethylene oxide and 1, 4-dioxane, both of which are carcinogens. Petrolatum – This is a petroleum product; yes the same substance from which gasoline is refined. It’s used in products to form a hydration barrier and makes lipsticks shiny. It may be linked to cancer and because of its danger, the EU has restricted its use in cosmetics. Siloxanes – These are used in moisturizers, treatments, deodorant, and lotions to soften the skin and dry hair faster. They are also used in implants, windshield coating, and building sealants. It’s a known endocrine disruptor, may impair fertility, and may influence neurotransmitters, and not in a good way. Sodium Laureth Sulfate – Even if you stay away from trends, jump on board the sulfate-free train! This is used as a foaming agent in shampoos, shower gels, and facial washes but also in laundry detergent and dish soap – tough on stains, even tougher on your skin! Sulfates can contain 1,4-dioxane, which is a known carcinogen, can disrupt the nervous system, and can irritate the skin and eyes. Triclosan – This is mainly used in deodorant as a preservative and anti-bacterial agent. It is suspected to be an endocrine disruptor and easily accumulates in your body to dangerous levels. Some research suggests it could be harmful to the immune system and may cause reproductive issues. As much as B.O. stinks, the pros of ditching this ingredient outweigh the cons. And don’t worry, we’ve got a healthier deodorant anyway. At AILLEA, we provide high-performing cosmetics that are safe and toxin-free. With this, we encourage you to make the switch and ditch the ugly chemicals for products made with nature’s finest. We’ve scrutinized labels and searched all over the U.S. for top brands that use only natural, high-quality, and chemical-free ingredients to create non-toxic beauty products so you can shop easy and beautify naturally.

For 9 years, MGD has played a key role in defining and strengthening LBBC’s “look” brand image. In 2008, I appointed Vicki Gray-Wolfe, Creative Partner at MGD, to lead the design strategy. I knew she could translate LBBC’s needs into an aesthetic that was welcoming and accessible. Her quiet, soft and feminine style was a perfect fit. Key to her initial strategy was employing patterns as a way to signal the diversity of women that LBBC serves. Every pattern was different. The result was a suite of materials that reflected a tapestry of voices and experiences of the breast cancer community. It was a strong acknowledgment that LBBC valued those they served. As LBBC’s impact began to solidify, their position as a provider of definition and meaning to so many affected by breast cancer became a focal point of their messaging strategy. Kevin Gianotto, Associate Director of Marketing, described LBBC as “an organization not afraid to redefine definitions.” His idea to create a campaign around this notion was rolled out in the 2011 Annual Report, and shortly thereafter it transformed into a smart new image across their collateral. The definitions campaign reinforced LBBC’s position as an authority that actively expands and reshapes the perspective of living beyond a diagnosis. In 2013, big developments were afoot. The organization was growing in terms of programs, services and staff. There was an increasing interest in LBBC, not just from women but also men affected by breast cancer. And their audience of healthcare providers, family members, the medical community and funders was expanding as well. It was time to tweak the materials so that they projected a voice of inclusion and were more gender-neutral. Streamlining the identity in favor of a bolder, more expansive look was also a goal. Simply put, LBBC was bigger and more universal in their appeal. Their design materials needed to address that shift in scale. While the integrity of a brand rarely changes, many internal and external factors drive a brand’s visual representation. In 2015, LBBC was planning for a major move to accommodate their growing enterprise. A more responsive website—a critical tool in their suite of exceptional information—was due to launch that same year. And on the horizon was a major milestone.

84,23,20,9,11,2015,2015-11-09,"Diane Fine kicks off our National Family Caregivers Month blog series with a post about the love and support she gave to her late best friend, Katherine Mendez. On October 15, 2015, my best friend lost the fight she could never win. Metastatic breast cancer allows for no survivors. Our journey began in June 2014. I say our journey because that is what it felt like. For 16 months, it would be the largest part of my life. Let me go back… Katherine and I were getting ready for a trip at the end of August. We were excited because she was near the five-year mark of being declared cancer-free. Katherine called to tell me she was bleeding. It was thought to be cervical cancer. Though scared, we were told a hysterectomy would cure it. Twenty minutes after the surgery started, the surgeon informed me that cancer had gone into her cervical wall and pathology reports concluded it was the spread of her breast cancer, making metastatic, or mets. I remember sitting there, alone, thinking that I had to call people and tell them she has metastasis. From that to going in with the dr. to tell her, it’s a blur. We were told that the cancer had become triple-negative (it was previously ER-positive). As Katherine sat crying, frightened, I promised that I would be with her until the end. I didn’t know that would mean sitting for 6-8 hours each week, worrying each time a scan was due, watching her suffer. She wanted more information but was afraid to look. I joined several metastatic groups that were open to caregivers. One of these was where I met the people who would form METUP.org (I am now on the executive council). I researched for hours. I needed to find hope. We sought three opinions. I made sure I could take Katherine to weekly chemo, doctor’s appointments, scans. I stayed with her every other week for two-three nights. Opposite weeks she had her 15-year-old son, so it was done in a day. I live in Massachusetts, she was in Maine. I cried with her but mostly I cried alone or with the people from the support groups. Many friends pulled away saying I was too involved in cancer or should let others (who?) care for her. I felt very alone. The backstory of our friendship is that we had found each other four years ago. Katherine and I were good friends in high school and like many we drifted in our 20s. I found her through Facebook. Katherine and I both felt an instant reconnection. In fact one of my fondest mementos is a card she made. Connected by a red thread were pictures of us as teens, with a proverb explaining that we were destined to find each other again no matter time or place. We both thought we’d have many years to continue our friendship. However, that wasn’t to be. Despite Katherine’s cancer, we had fun. Each week in chemo we’d keep entertained, at times with a competitive game of Boggle. I was privileged to be able to finally get her to Montreal. Katherine was always a peace and social justice advocate. I had done my share of protesting but she reawakened that in me. She walked the walk in a way few do. In May, Katherine took a break from chemo because of side effects. The next scans showed the cancer had spread extensively. We were both devastated. Continue reading →",0,1,0.13855492424242424
87,23,23,19,10,2015,2015-10-19,"Veza founder, Brandon Michaels, came up with the idea for Veza—a line of trendy wristbands in 12 colors that support 12 different charities—when he was 16 years old. His passion for sporty and fashionable wrist-wear always had him searching for cool, new styles. Brandon eventually decided it was time to modernize the wristband and give it his own twist. Rather than support just one charity, as other companies tend to do, I decided to have each wristband color support a different cause that meant something special to me. I thought it would be cool to let supporters decide what charity they want to give back to. The unfortunate “commonness” of breast cancer was something I had seen around me and I immediately decided that the Pink Wristband would support a breast cancer cause. While searching the many nonprofits that support breast cancer and breast cancer awareness, I came across Living Beyond Breast Cancer. What I like about LBBC is that it doesn’t focus on research or medicine. Instead, it is one of the only nonprofits, rated four-star by Charity Navigator, that focuses on helping better the lives of those diagnosed and their families. For the second year in a row, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, every purchase of the Pink on White Veza wristband is offering additional support to Living Beyond Breast Cancer: 20 percent of sales from each Pink on White Veza will be donated to LBBC in support of their goal to connect people with trusted breast cancer information and a community of support.

88,23,24,12,10,2015,2015-10-12,"Catherine Ormerod, MSS, MLSP, is Vice President, Programs and Partnerships at Living Beyond Breast Cancer. responsible for overseeing the implementation of all direct service and partnership initiatives in support of Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s mission. Last year as part of its long-standing commitment to those living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), Living Beyond Breast Cancer launched an advocacy program called “Hear My Voice.” We introduced the program on Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day, the one day in October dedicated to the raising awareness of the needs and voices of people with MBC. Because women living with MBC will always be in treatment, their outlook and concerns are different from women treated for early-stage breast cancer. As an organization that represents all people impacted by breast cancer, LBBC is committed to building public understanding of the different stages of the disease. The first initiative in this program highlighted the many voices of MBC in a blog carnival. On October 13 we posted one blog post every hour, on the hour, for 13 hours. These diverse and riveting stories from women and men living with the diagnosis quickly became our most widely read stories on the blog. We launched the second phase of the program — the Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Program — in the spring of 2015. This 10-month volunteer commitment teaches and refines participants’ communications skills and asks them to find others with MBC in their communities and connect them to resources and information. We also ask the volunteers to create projects that they work on during their time as volunteers. In addition, each of them participated in an online public education campaign about MBC in September called #BeyondtheBreast. Through strong images on social media, this campaign made the point that metastatic breast cancer is cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. “We at LBBC learned during the past year that the commitment of our volunteers is both deep and diverse.” With all of this, we at LBBC learned during the past year that the commitment of our volunteers is both deep and diverse. Their activities and actions have far exceeded the expectations we set for them in the program. They have sat on research panels, pitched their stories to local and national news organizations, planned rallies, written books, launched support programs, and met with legislators to demand more research dollars are spent on understanding the process of metastasis. And they connected hundreds to information and resources, breaking the isolation that study after study confirms is experienced by so many with MBC. Our Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Class of 2015. Today, as we recognize Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day, we will highlight some of our most moving blogs written by those living with advanced breast cancer from this past year and our previous blog carnival (see below). Our volunteers continue their work in a stunning variety of ways to push forward change. And because many others are focused on changing the trajectory of MBC — volunteers, nonprofit organizations, researchers and others — we have the opportunity to move the conversation about MBC forward and thus move closer to achieving our shared vision: ending metastatic breast cancer. We began the program with 31 volunteers and last month lost a devoted volunteer, dear friend and powerful voice to the disease. We dedicate our efforts this month to the memory of Marcia Taylor.

89,23,25,9,10,2015,2015-10-09,"Kitt Allan continues our Breast Reconstruction and You Blog Series in anticipation of our Twitter Chat on October 21, Breast Reconstruction Awareness (BRA) Day. We posted part one earlier this week. Learn more about Ms. Allan and her apparel, for which proceeds of sales benefit LBBC. Reconstruction is a topic near and dear to my heart even though I haven’t had it myself. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer when I was four months pregnant. The doctors on my team – a surgeon, an oncologist, and a high-risk OB, all advised quick action since my tumor was very aggressive and we needed to get as far as possible in my treatment before I gave birth. About a week after diagnosis I had a unilateral mastectomy and then started chemotherapy. I had asked my surgeon if I should have a double mastectomy but she didn’t see it as a good option because my right breast was healthy and she didn’t want to keep me in surgery any longer than necessary. At the time reconstruction wasn’t an option. The surgeons agreed that with all the body changes of pregnancy it might be as long as two years before my body would settle down enough for a good reconstruction. At the time, hearing that didn’t bother me that much, as you might imagine my main goal was to have a healthy baby and be healthy enough to be a good mom. I was fit for a prosthetic, or form as I usually call it, and began wearing it. And over the days and months, having a form on one side and a breast on the other became my new body, and surprisingly I became comfortable with it. Sometimes now I even forget that I don’t have two real breasts. Reconstruction can be made to seem like an inevitable part of the treatment process. Every time I visit my breast surgeon she tells me about all of the new surgical techniques and I have to admit that options have come a long way and more and more women are happy with the results. I listen, always wondering if she’ll say something that changes my mind, but that hasn’t happened yet. The only time I ever considered reconstruction was while shopping for lingerie and swimwear and I felt limited by the choices available to me. I wasn’t ready to resign myself to frumpy clothes, so through my business I give survivors more choices so that we can all feel comfortable in our own skin and more like ourselves again. I think there are a million great reasons for women to have reconstruction but finding garments that make you feel like yourself shouldn’t be one of them. “When it comes to reconstruction, and just about anything else in life, I think each woman should decide for herself what she wants to do with her own body.” When it comes to reconstruction, and just about anything else in life, I think each woman should decide for herself what she wants to do with her own body. From my own experience, I also know that not all women can have reconstruction even if they want it. I design garments that take into account all different choices and realities. While attending LBBC’s Wellness Weekend a couple of weeks ago I was struck by the number of women, many of them young, weighing their options for reconstruction – thinking seriously whether to have it, when to have, or how to have it. I was glad to see them getting information not only from doctors but also from other women who have been there. All women should have as much information as possible to make the best choice for themselves. I wish that women who can’t have reconstruction, or don’t choose to, had the chance to meet more women like themselves so that they didn’t feel so alone. The truth is we aren’t all doing it and the recent JAMA study showed nearly 60% of women don’t choose to or can’t have reconstruction. I had no idea there were so many women like me. Over these last few years I continue to educate myself and I am still happy with my decision to stay as I am. First, I couldn’t have reconstruction and once I could I found that I didn’t want it.

91,23,27,6,10,2015,2015-10-06,"My Fabulous Boobies writer and breast cancer advocate Nicole McLean kicks off our Breast Reconstruction and You Blog Series in anticipation of our Twitter Chat on October 21, Breast Reconstruction Awareness (BRA) Day. A version of this post appeared on her blog in October 2012. It was reposted with her permission. Hello boys and girls. Today we’re going to discuss mastectomies and breast reconstruction. Don’t look at the screen that way… I’ll keep it easy. I promise. I’ve attached a picture to this post of two women who are survivors. The sister in the first picture is posing with so much sass, and showing off her mastectomy scar. The second picture is showing the scars from a breast reconstruction surgery. I selected these two pictures because these two women represent me. My Mastectomy Story Four months after I started chemotherapy, I had a modified radical mastectomy. Definition: a mastectomy is surgery that removes the whole or as much of the breast tissue as possible. There are different types of mastectomies, but basically the purpose of a mastectomy is to remove the cancerous breast from the body in order to prevent the spread of the cancer to other parts of the body. It is (in my understanding) a life-saving measure. I struggled for months to accept losing my breast. I could not grasp the concept that I had to lose a part of my body in order to save my life. However, because of different things about my cancer, as much as I wanted to save my breast it was not the best course of action. In my case, I had multiple tumors in my breast tissue. At least one tumor was very, very close to my chest wall (which meant that it was close to my bones). And a biopsy revealed that the cancer had started to migrate away from the breast and had entered my lymph nodes (which meant that if it was not caught at that time, it would have entered my blood stream and could have ended up in other organs). So after debating with my medical team and pleading with God for some other option for months, I eventually accepted that losing my breast was the best course of action for me. Each Survivor Has a Different Choice to Make After Their Diagnosis Not every survivor has to face this decision. Some survivors do not have to have any breast surgery. Those cases are caught very early (perhaps from a mammogram or some other test that reveals cancer cells) and they are handled with chemotherapy or radiation (or both) without surgery. Some survivors are eligible for a lumpectomy, which is a breast-sparing procedure that removes just the cancerous tumor and leaves the majority of the breast intact. I wasn’t that fortunate. [insert advice here: This is why being proactive about your breast health is important. The earlier the cancer is detected, the less invasive the treatment is and the higher the likelihood that the cancer can be removed completely.] Now, Let’s Discuss Breast Reconstruction – I Chose a TRAM Flap Procedure The picture to the right shows a woman after she had a mastectomy. The second picture is a sister showing her reconstruction scars and her reconstructed breast. There are a lot of ways that a woman who chooses to have her breast replaced can do that. She can have implants. Or she can choose to have reconstruction that uses her own body tissue (like I did) to reconstruct a breast. There are a few different types of procedures that utilize your own tissue. The surgery I had was a TRAM flap. Definition: TRAM flap (transverse rectus abdominus muscle) is a surgical procedure that creates a new breast mound using tissue from your belly that is tunneled under your abdominal muscles and up to your chest. The procedure is very detailed and requires a lot of surgery. But, it is a one-shot deal. Meaning, unlike breast implants, you do not have to have several procedures before your breast is done. I went into the hospital with one breast. I came out of surgery 12 hours later with two. It is not the same way for implants. However, with implants, the surgery is not as invasive and it works if you are not a candidate for a flap procedure. Life after the TRAM As you can see from the picture, there is a long scar that stretches from hip to hip along your bikini line and then there is a large scar around the breast. You will also notice that there is no nipple and no areola either. Lemme tell you… the first time I looked at my noobie (noobie = new boobie) I was not prepared for the Barbie-like look. (laughs) However, in all honesty, the option for what amounted to a tummy tuck at the same time I’d get a new breast was sort of the selling point for me. You can laugh… yes I’m vain like that. And I’ve been pretty happy with my flatter tummy too. My theory was… if I’m going to lose my breast, get kicked into early menopause and lose my fertility… at least I can be gorgeous after its all said and done. So, there ya go. Now you know the basics about losing a breast and gaining a new one. There are a lot more details that I could go into but… I’m trying to take you slowly so that you’re not overwhelmed and freaked out. (laughs) But this is it. Why I chose the TRAM flap I spent 10 months with one breast. I was miserable as hell about it. I felt like a lopsided freak. Even though I eventually came to accept it. I never liked wearing my prosthesis. I hated that even after I purchased the largest prosthetic breast I could find, it still was significantly smaller than my natural breast. I hated that I had to stuff my bra with the prosthesis to try to look even. And I hated that I had to have a breast reduction so that my natural breast was the same size as my noobie. I know… that’s a lot of hate right there. But its true. I fought and dragged my feet through all of this. But, now that I’m on the other side… I’m so much better about all of it. And… I can wear a bikini now. (laughs) It is the little things in life that make me happy. I have about four bikinis now — before cancer I would be hard pressed to even put on a bathing suit. I will probably have many more before its all said and done. I’m not suggesting that wearing a bikini makes all of this worthwhile. Because, well, that would be silly. But I am telling you that life does go on and you can reclaim some of your self-esteem and walk into your new normal with a happier outlook. for me, it was important to have two breasts. For some women it is not. Some women opt to remove both breasts. Some women opt to never replace their lost breast. It is a very personal choice and journey. There is no right way to do it. You have to do what works for you.

93,23,29,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Concluding our blog series for Beyond the Breast, Lesley Glenn writes about preparing for her climb of Mt. Whitney, which she’s attempting today (we’re rooting for you, Lesley!). She reflects on how the preparation has informed her approach to living with metastatic breast cancer. Take action with the Beyond The Breast Campaign. As you are reading this, I am attempting my first climb up Mt. Whitney, the tallest mountain in the lower 48 at 14,505 feet. The stats say that 2 out of 3 people who attempt the mountain on their first try, don’t make it. I am going with two of my girlfriends. You do the math. All of us have been training equally. Not one of us has an advantage over the other. We each have the desire, tenacity and perseverance to conquer the mountain. We each want our summit experience. But what we don’t know is how each will respond to the high altitude. Or what weather system might be waiting for us at 10, 12, or 14,000 feet. No matter how optimistic, how much we have trained, or are prepared for this climb…. …It’s a crap shoot – something that is random, not based on skill. All of us may summit, two of us, one of us…. or maybe none of us. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It’s just like stage IV metastatic breast cancer – the incurable breast cancer. You’ve heard these stats. 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. approximately 30% of all women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will go on to have metastatic disease regardless of treatment. But do you know these figures? Approximately 40,000 women and men die of metastatic breast cancer every year in the US, and this number has not changed meaningfully in 40 years. (1) Break this down to #110 daily. Yes, daily. The median survival from diagnosis with metastatic breast cancer is 2-3 years, and this number has not changed meaningfully in 20 years. (2) About 24% of patients with metastatic breast cancer will be alive 5 years after diagnosis.(3) Living with metastatic breast cancer is also like climbing a tall mountain. It’s a crap shoot – something that could produce a good or bad result. In other words, some of us might live a long life (summit). But statistics show most of us will die from the disease. (We won’t make it to the top.) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My climb is a gamble. My life is a gamble. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yes, I know…..I hear it all the time. “Everyone’s life is a gamble.” It’s true. But the odds are more against me than those who don’t have a metastatic cancer diagnosis. When I come back down off of the mountain, my hope is that I will be able to share with everyone about my summit experience. But if I’m not able to, then I will share with you about my journey in trying to get to the top…..the challenges, the victories, the moments where I wanted to quit, and the junctures where my dream to summit drove me forward. As is my intention to share my journey in living with metastatic breast cancer. The good, the bad, the ugly, the inspirational….the reality. Lesley is a wife, mom, artist, writer and an avid hiker. Since January of 2015, she has hiked over 40 trails, and climbed up 10 mountains. She has been living with stage IV disease since May 2013, and is currently stable. She just turned 50 years old.

94,23,3,1,4,2016,2016-04-01,"If you know Living Beyond Breast Cancer, then you know the work of Lisa Weinberger and her team at Masters Group Design. For almost ten years, Lisa and her colleagues have played an invaluable role in defining LBBC’s “look” and visual identity. This is the first part of a three part series Lisa has penned for our 25th Anniversary Blog Series. Twenty-five years ago, and at the same time that Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) was born, I learned that I had a blood disease. I was 24 years old and shocked by the revelation. I’d never heard of this disease. I couldn’t pronounce it or spell it. And worse, I didn’t know a soul who had ever had it. My life came to a screeching halt. For months, I rotated through hematologists’ offices—cumulating mountains of lab results, adjusting drug regimens and receiving invasive treatment to suppress the unwelcome stranger in my body. The experience was surreal. I was faced with a new reality—a world where facts were scarce. There were no support groups or helplines. The lack of easy-to-access information contributed daily to my anxiety. I didn’t have the benefit of today’s robust Internet nor the connection of social media. I would have benefitted greatly if I could have learned from and networked with others who had experienced my illness. But I seemed to be one among a community of none. Never in my life did I feel so alone. As unexpectedly as the disease had arrived, it miraculously departed about a year later. It did, however, leave an indelible mark on me. I understand the fear that illness brings, the need for information and the desire to live beyond a diagnosis. In 1993, I launched Masters Group Design (MGD), a communications firm in Philadelphia. We help non-profit organizations crystalize their message and, through design, spread it with maximum impact. All of our clients seek to change the world in meaningful ways. And all of them make my daily work fulfilling. But there are some clients whose work resonates with me in personal and profound ways. Living Beyond Breast Cancer is one of them. Nine years ago, my company was selected by LBBC to strengthen their marketing and educational materials. I was immediately drawn to and inspired by their mission. I knew that connecting and empowering people affected by breast cancer through information, support and community would offer them three lifelines. And, given their vision of creating a world where no one affected by breast cancer ever felt alone, I knew they understood that for those facing illness, knowing someone is with you, for you, is invaluable. I was eager to round up the MGD team to amplify LBBC’s voice and help them gain the exposure that their important work deserved. Janine Guglielmino, then LBBC’s Communications Director, was responsible for guiding the projects assigned to us. I learned from her that the role of design was extremely serious and sensitive business for LBBC. The material we created needed to: Speak to all women, regardless of their age, level of education or background. Welcome and comfort—not intimidate. Acknowledge that breast cancer was not the same experience for everyone. Janine’s deep compassion and desire to communicate with dignity and delicacy were hallmarks of LBBC. Her sensitivity to how information gets crafted and delivered inspired our work from day one. Breast cancer IS NOT the same for everyone as Lisa and her team would demonstrate, using design to visually tell LBBC’s incredible story.

When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, I didn’t even know it was possible to have breast cancer go beyond the breast. But on August 27, 2014, at 43 years old, I joined some 150,000 U.S. women and men in a journey beyond our control. I am blessed beyond measure with the people in my life. I am wife and a mother, a daughter and a sister, an aunt and a niece, a friend and a co-worker. My husband and I are raising four teenage boys and a middle school-aged daughter. Our lives are sometimes busy beyond belief, but they are everything to me. My heart breaks for them. When you are stage IV, you learn to look beyond what you can see. We all have a timeline with no real numbers on it. But when your cancer has metastasized, you are suddenly holding that timeline in your hands. No numbers. Only an average of three years. What does that mean? How long is that? There is no time to waste. Life is found somewhere beyond our doubts. I have to live beyond my limits. This isn’t day-to-day life anymore. With ongoing infusions and injections, my body changes. Exhaustion hangs on my shoulder. My stomach battles me at will. Then there are all the other side effects that come and go as they wish. But there still is so much I want to do and see. So I seek to find sustainability and balance for myself. I teeter totter between pacing myself through my treatments and doing as much as I can with my friends and family. I found myself beyond scared. I knew there wasn’t time to waste dwelling on “poor me.” I wanted everyone to hear my voice. I quickly found that I was not alone. Our voices are being heard as the landscape of our prognosis is ever-changing. But sadly, approximately 110 of my stage IV sisters are still dying every day. We need more. Research does continue to make remarkable advances in treatments, but they can only do this with more funding. With good news always on the horizon, I don’t lose faith that the cure is just beyond our reach. I never dreamed I would be here…with cancer beyond the breast.

She writes reflects on her journey, including life after her diagnosis of stage IV. Learn how you can support people like Adrian through our Beyond the Breast Campaign. I am a wife, mother, grandmother , sister and friend. On May 19, 2011, I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. My treatment regimen consisted of me completing 16 cycles of chemotherapy treatments, getting a bilateral double mastectomy and 37 radiation therapy treatments. I finished treatments in March 2012, which is when I was considered no evidence of disease (NED). In July 2012 I had some issues with with my ovaries. After medical screenings, it was then suggested that I have a hysterectomy. I had the surgery and the surgery went well. I had a few minor complications after the surgery which delayed my healing. It can take anywhere from 6-8 weeks for healing after this particular surgery, but it took me about 12 weeks because of minor complications. Being diagnosed with a deadly disease such as breast cancer changes your life n ways you can’t begin to imagine. I remember sleeping a full night sleep, which was about 7 to 8 hours. Now, I’m sleeping only two to three hours a night, if that and that has been going on since 2011. There are many things in life that happen completely unplanned (much of it we don’t even want to happen) but we adjust, regroup and keep pushing foward. My daughter was in 4th grade when I was diagnosed with stage IIIB breast cancer. My son had just graduated high school and started his first year of college. I attended PTA meetings, football games, birthday parties, family trips, family dinner dates and just plain old mother and son time with my son. I feel like my daughter is being cheated out of time with her mom because I was unable to attend her dance practices, cheerleader practices, school events, family events, fixing her hair, shopping and so much more due to this deadly disease. I worry about my daughter more than anything in this world. No one can love her like me. There are so many things that changed with my day to life especially my energy. Many things changed tremendously with my husband and me. He cooked dinner, cleaned our home, he did laundry and worked 60 hours a week at his job. I may be wrong for saying this but there are many days I would look at my husband and actually feel sorry for him and feel like he deserved better. I say this because there are so many days where I don’t want to talk yet along hug or kiss. As months past I tried very hard to get my life in order. I would attend therapy treatments to help me move forward. The psychiatrist that I saw on a weekly basis felt like I was doing quite well under the circumstances. Moving forward and healing quite well I was hit with yet another devastating blow. In July 2014. I was devastated when I was re-diagnosed with a metastasis of my original breast cancer diagnosis. The cancer has now spread to my neck, chest wall and pelvic area. To hear those words made me very sad. My oncologist said to me, “Unfortunately Mrs. McClenney you will be doing chemotherapy for the rest of your life.” Life as I know it has completely been turned upside down. At this time it is hard for me to even handle a simple load of laundry, get the mail, cook a simple meal or even drive my car. These simple things make me feel as if I have ran miles. Marathon miles. No matter what I refuse to lose. I am tired every day, but it is my duty to fight like a big girl. I face all my the challenges with a smile. I have a family that needs me but loves me more. At the end of the day I am EXHAUSTED and I may not be the same but I refuse to not fight back. Some days the most I can do is shower and read; with those days, I feel as if I have conquered the world. If I could leave you with any words today it would be to know your family history and most of all know your body. And most importantly, you’re not alone!",0,1,0.05123795351473923

101,23,36,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Doris-Ann Price, on how nature inspired her approach to coping with symptoms and side effects. Be a part of the Beyond the Breast Campaign. I never expected that two recent outdoor jaunts into the salty New England sea air and water could feel more like positive spiritual reinforcement of my life navigation strategies — but BLIMEY, so they did! First, over Labor Day weekend, nature reminded me how important it is to stay attuned to the many unseen challenges it poses to navigating successfully through the channels of the Cape Cod Bay, I listened carefully as it reiterated a couple of basic truths about the importance of plumbing one’s own inner resources and staying strong but calm when faced with navigating the bay’s deceptively shallow waters. Then again today, I heard that same voice from the sea calling out from New Hampshire’s rocky, heavily buttressed seacoast. I appreciate that being prodded always helps when trying to remain strong against the unforgiving pummeling of the unpredictable waves of life. What a gift from the sea it is to feel attuned to nature’s messages, and to be able to draw from its sage urgings as I continue seeking new ways to stay the path along my journey with metastatic breast cancer. Last week on Cape Cod Bay, I learned from my boatsman friend the importance of tuning in to the message of the sea to help navigate through unreliable channel markers. The channel markers at low tide that afternoon had been all rendered inaccurate by the shifting sand beneath the water, so they did not reveal the shallow sandbars impeding our route. I observed how my friend applied his skills of observation, along with knowledge gained from years of experience, in order to help strategize how to get our boat through the murky water and into safe harbor. He explained the importance of knowing the nuances that daily impact navigation on the bay at low tide, as well as the impact of seasonal shifts, then added that sometimes it even becomes necessary to cast to the wind the ‘rule book’ for navigating the brackish waters. Nature, it seems, will generally find a way to pummel our every expectation, in defiance of whatever ‘knowledge‘ we think we have working for us; so as stage IV patients, it can also be extremely useful to understand how to summon our own resources to help us reset our course and make our way to safety. I learned from observation that the persistent voice of the crashing waves is much like the unrelenting, ever-changing symptoms that we MBC patients encounter each day. While the seawall serves as a barrier to protect low-lying coastal areas from the ocean’s fury, I observed how it is constantly buffeted by powerful waves that threaten to infiltrate its cracks and undermine its apparent impermeability. Nevertheless, I noted that seawalls continue being erected and reinforced in spite of the inevitable power of the sea to break through their seemingly stony facade. Likewise, we patients must continue seeking new ways to repair the ‘cracks in our facade,’ and to apply new strategies to keep our emotional fortress strong! Indeed, it became increasingly apparent to me during these recent adventures along the challenging New England seacoast that navigating brackish waters requires much more than a compass. Moreover, resisting and restraining the power of the sea demands persistence as well as effective strategies as we seek to mine our own rich wells of experience, knowledge, and instincts. And last, but not least, the challenges of nature invite us to open up our hearts, cross our fingers, and mine our spirit in spite of unanticipated setbacks that may threaten to sink our boat. Applying The Lessons Of The Sea To Symptom Management And so it is with navigating symptom management: Each of us needs to know how to recognize and tap our own resources, so we are better able to navigate through the ever-changing symptoms and side effects of treatment. Being able to do so is empowering as it turns us into our most powerful resource – an empowered self-advocate! Building My Own Protective Barriers And Fending Off The Side Effects Of Treatment Anyway, here I am, 3 weeks into what I hope will be yet another “protective seawall” (in my own 9-and-a-half-year series of frequently debilitating, temporarily effective back-to-back MBC treatments). With mets to my brain, thyroid, lungs, bones, liver, and lymph system (plus paralyzed vocal cords that causes difficulty swallowing and speaking), my physical challenges continue to mount. Yet I never fail to seek new ways to keep my freak flag flying! I am told frequently that I am strong or brave, and that my strength lies in my positivity; but I am as vulnerable as the weakest among you. I believe my strength resides in my ability to look at the whole picture, but restrict my focus to one issue at a time – applying available information, innate knowledge, experience, and faith to seek a solution to my challenges. Moreover, it lies with my continued determination not to allow fear and additional waves to break through my seawall! As I write these words, I am temporarily located almost 800 miles from home, where I am enrolled in an early phase clinical trail at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. I am also trying to reignite my spirit and morph into the next phase of ‘new normal.’ But even though I am blessed here with the support of new friends, I am still far from home, family, long-time friends, and familiar surroundings. Although my challenges are great I still believe that the best approach to ‘keep on keeping on’ lies in being able to mine my own natural resources, and then find ways to stay strong against the relentless advance of shifting sands that sometimes feel like a greedy hole that (if I allow it) will suck me under. CLOSING THOUGHTS May you discover your own seawall of strength, learning how to mine your own unique resources, so that you will be better able to resist tides of negativity, powerful waves of doubt, fear, and insecurity, and any challenges that threaten to pull you into a dangerous vortex and drag you under. A LESSON FOR ALL OF US Meanwhile, I am holding ground here in Boston, and remain a passionate but realistic self-advocate who realizes she does not have ultimate control to prevent her ship from eventually succumbing to the sea, but nevertheless intends to continue charting her own course to better navigate the challenges that lie ahead. Today is the first day of the rest of my life (and yours), and I have discovered that the best I can do is to attack daily challenges through my self-advocacy, and to continue discouraging unproductive self-blame and regrets. We cannot know what would or should have been, and we do not know what may happen tomorrow. But we can be resourceful, and make the most of what we do have today! Think about it: How amazing is it that each of us can gain access to our own strategy for living with BC mets, once we identify how to quiet down our lives long enough to invite our spirit to align with nature? So give yourself a hug and let’s congratulate ourselves for making it through another day! May each of us discover how to best access and draw on our own strengths, while inviting our spirits to align with the natural world. That’s a journey we should all be able to LIVE WITH!",0,1,0.2592894759561427

Learn more about metastatic disease from our campaign, Beyond the Breast. I was a 49-year-old triathlete in my prime when first diagnosed with stage IIIa invasive ductal carcinoma. It was ER-positive and HER2-positive. After a year of the usual poison/slash/burn I was deemed “cancer free, as far as we can know.” A short nine months later I felt a lump in my neck and was quickly diagnosed with breast cancer that had metastasized to my lungs, liver, and mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes. My breast cancer was officially beyond the breast. I was treated with Taxotere, Herceptin, and Perjeta and enjoyed a year with no evidence of disease (NED) while continuing on Herceptin and Perjeta. But I wasn’t done yet. None of us metsters ever are. In the spring of this year I experienced some mild disorientation while doing flip turns during my regular swims. Yup. I learned I had brain mets, the furthest and scariest beyond the breast imaginable. My status right now is unknown. I’ve had whole brain radiation and am back on chemo (Xeloda) and HER2-targeted therapy (Tykerb), which are known to cross the blood brain barrier. I won’t know how I am until late September when I have a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT and a brain MRI. This experience has been, among other things, an education. Making treatment decisions (or more accurately, accepting the recommendations of my trusted oncologist), and communicating with myriad healthcare providers has given me perspective on control and the lack thereof. For me, I don’t so much make decisions about my treatment as make one big decision to continue to be treated in the hope of living as long as possible. My medical oncologist is brilliant, and driven by data. Since I trust him, I do what he recommends. I am uncomfortable in a position of deciding between or among treatment options when I know that there is data to support one modality or the other, and my oncologist knows a lot more than I do about it. I made personal decisions during my early stage treatment regarding whether to have a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy, and whether to reconstruct. Beyond that I felt I needed to put myself in the hands of experts, of which I am not one. Maybe this makes me appear passive about my care. This is far from the truth. I am well educated on the studies, however small, that say that one treatment or other may work. And, I know that sometimes the standard of care works and sometimes it doesn’t. This is the most frustrating aspect of cancer care to me. NO ONE knows why some patients respond to treatment and some don’t. I imagine that being an oncologist is as frustrating as being a patient for this reason. I’ve also gained a sometimes-bizarre education in communicating with healthcare providers and the health care bureaucracy. I don’t think my stories of what I call my “medical moments” are all that unique, nor do I believe that many of these amazing gaffes imply that I am getting bad care. I believe I’m getting excellent care, but I have a little advice for everyone from receptionists to radiation oncologists. The following all actually happened! Please, primary care nurse, don’t leave the exam room to schedule my mammogram, as a quick peek at my chart will tell you that I don’t have any breasts. Please, arrogant plastic surgeon, don’t tell me how easy and convenient it will be to have implants. The reality is they come with their own complications and a whole lot of discomfort, even three-and-a-half years out. Just tell the truth or say you don’t know. Radiation oncologist, please just answer my questions even if they seem trite. Don’t tell me that when I should expect to lose my hair is “the least of my worries.” I am well aware that my 18 brain lesions are a bigger concern. Just give me the dignity of answering my questions. Generally, office people: Please, please, please take the long road and help with scheduling scans and procedures without me having to be the lady that “calls all the time.” I know you are overworked but scanxiety and cancer anxiety are very real. You can go a long way to helping to alleviate some of it. And in general, providers, PLEASE review my most current information before you talk to me. Don’t scare my husband and me by referring to a year-old scan from my initial mets diagnosis! We have the technology, people! Please prepare to walk into an exam room and talk to a patient. The thing about being a cancer patient is that EVERY interaction we have is fraught with anxiety and second-guesses about its true meaning. Cancer levels us all into puddles of fear a lot of the time. Add to that cognitive difficulties as a result of chemotherapy (multiple regimens in my case) or say, whole brain radiation and it is a gloppy stew needing constant adjustments to the burner temp, the seasoning, the balance of ingredients. Poor communication like the above only feeds the fear beast. I know that’s not the intention in committing to caring for people. If you work in health care, I’m telling you this in the hope that you will stop, breathe, and consider how a cancer patient might interpret your interaction. I do not want to silence you, or make you afraid you may not ever say anything right. We are all humans, and there is nothing easy about interacting with each other. Say that. If you are a patient, A.) keep it together and get to the root of what you want to know. Or, B.) burst into tears if someone has scared you or been insensitive. Both are appropriate responses to stress. If you choose B.), make sure to go back to A.) Persist. Pick your battles. I am not battling cancer. I don’t believe in “battle language.” I am accepting treatment and hoping it gives me a longer life. My “battles” are for clear communication, maintaining trust in the experts I have chosen to help me, and importantly, for dignity as a cancer patient.

104,23,39,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Jill Cohen, on living with stage IV breast cancer for 13 years. Learn more about metastatic breast cancer and support the Beyond the Breast Campaign. In August I celebrated 13 years of living with metastatic breast cancer. Yes, I celebrated – wouldn’t you? I called it my ”cancer bat mitzvah.” Many friends brought chocolate, sang, and danced with us. We even shared words of Torah, from the Jewish Bible’s portion for that week. How do I begin to talk about living with advanced cancer for thirteen years? From the first day when we got the news that my femur was riddled with mets and broke that very night, to hearing my oncologist tell me the truly despairing odds in 2002. Through every hormonal blocker, multiple rounds of radiation, and fifteen different chemotherapies. From bone mets to liver mets to brain mets and skin mets. From the slow-growing cancer to the faster-growing one, it has been a long ride on the Cancer Land merry-go-round. I call it a merry-go-round because sometimes I ride on the ponies, going up and down and holding on tight, and sometimes I sit back on the bench and try to relax. It’s also been an emotional and spiritual journey. Although I tend to be very practical, even about the brain mets, my connection to my religion and to my community has helped me in so many ways. I go to synagogue on Saturday mornings to sing with my community. We feed one another real food (when my leg broke they fed us three times a week for a month) and recharge my soul’s “batteries.” I have learned to lead and serve this community. I have lost many friends to cancer during all these years. I have dealt with my own mortality over and over again. I have written a medical directive, a will, and an ethical will, a Jewish tradition that goes back a thousand years. These things, especially the ethical will, have helped me understand what I hold dear, and what I would like to leave behind for my family and friends. It doesn’t make the prospect of dying from cancer any easier. It does help me express my values and then try to live up to them. Thirteen years ago I told my cancer that it could stay as long as it liked. As long as it was quiet, I would share my body with it. I refused to be at war with my own body. I’m not a cancer warrior. I don’t even call myself a survivor. Now I call myself an outlier. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote about in his book of that name, “if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking around them – at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their birth date.” No one can tell me why I have lived with mets for so long. There is no reason why I got cancer in the first place. I know that I only have this one life, and that I will do my best to find joy in each day. When a day, an hour, or even a minute seems too long and too filled with pain, that’s when I eat chocolate – what we call vitamin CH at home. That changes the moment from life with cancer, to simply life. At my annual mets party this year, we sang from Fiddler On The Roof. Here are the lyrics I shared with all: To us and our good fortune! Be happy, be healthy, long life. And if our good fortune never comes, Here’s to whatever comes, Drink l’chaim – to life!

105,23,4,27,3,2016,2016-03-27,"If you’re familiar with LBBC, you know we often speak of “a small group of women” who helped establish the organization with the help of their radiation oncologist, Marisa Weiss, MD. Margaux Jacks’s mother, Nancy Garbowski, was one of that small group. This is the second of a two-part blog. We posted part one earlier this week. In the early ‘90s, my Mom, Nancy, was receiving treatment at Paoli Memorial Hospital under the care of Marisa Weiss, MD, who recognized there was a lack of support for her patients. So Dr. Weiss organized a conference, which my Mom participated in. Their goal of the conference was to provide a safe space where women could get accurate and easy-to-understand breast cancer information from medical experts, while finding and connecting with each other. She wanted people to be able to talk about the disease, and to not feel as though it was some ugly thing that needed to be kept secret. This disease involves people’s lives — loved ones, parents, siblings, etc. And there is a ripple effect that cancer has, as all those involved with that person’s life have to process and deal with the weight of such a diagnosis. The connections my Mom made with other cancer survivors fueled her drive to survive. She learned about new treatments, testing, and techniques for battling the disease. Mind you, this was before the Internet, when you could goggle about treatment options and medications. She had a sense of power, as she took control of her illness. She was making the decisions, not cancer. And there was support. Support from others who knew exactly how she felt. Who knew the fear of facing the idea that cancer may end their lives. She had friends she could call — this was before cell phones — and ask about wigs and prosthetics. They would help each other delivering meals when someone was home from surgery. They made pretty head wraps so they could still feel beautiful. It became a family. “One of the things my mom was most proud of was being part of the group that organized LBBC 25 years ago.” One of the things my Mom was most proud of was being part of the group that organized LBBC 25 years ago. My Mom would be so proud to see how much LBBC has evolved, how it is impacting so many lives and making them better. She always spoke of maintaining quality of life. And that is something LBBC helps provide. Every time I see an update, or a new event, I know my Mom would be smiling. She would be thrilled to see how far this organization has come. This organization lives on. And for me, her daughter, it is a way I can remember her strength, perseverance, and passion for life. What a gift, as I reflect on her life during this year, the 20 th since her passing. It is something that she helped laid the groundwork for that is continuing to flourish today. I remain a part of this organization because I believe in the mission. And I know all too well, that no one should ever be alone when dealing with something as immense as facing cancer. Thank you, Living Beyond Breast Cancer! As this blog was being coordinated, little did we know that its scheduling would place part two smack dab on what would have been Nancy’s birthday. It’s fitting though, and a wonderful way to honor her memory. If you’re reading this and knew Nancy, or any of the original group of ladies who helped create what would become LBBC, Margaux would love to hear from you. Send a note to mail@lbbc.org and we’ll be happy to forward it along. If you have a special story to share about your history with LBBC that you feel might be appropriate for our 25 th Anniversary Blog Series, contact Kevin Gianotto at kevin@lbbc.org.",0,1,0.2772529299968325
106,23,40,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Nancy Stordahl blogs about why everyone, including those with early-stage breast cancer, need to show support for the issues affecting people with metastatic breast cancer. I am pleased and honored to be part of Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s public education initiative called, Beyond the Breast. The purpose of this effort is to continue to educate the public and those diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer about what metastatic breast cancer is. So many people are unaware that breast cancer can, and too often does, become deadly when it metastasizes or moves beyond the breast, hence the campaign and hashtag, #beyondthebreast. Year after year it continues to boggle my mind that so many people have never even heard of the word metastatic. Such a fact seems unfathomable to me when one considers all the hoopla that has been going on for decades now during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This is not the public’s fault. Rather, this a BIG fail of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and it’s an unacceptable failure. For too long the emphasis every October, in fact, all year-long, has been primarily on early detection, and early diagnosis. Early detection is important, but it is not the whole story. And the whole story matters. It always does. Why should those diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer concern themselves with metastatic breast cancer? Why should we all care? There are plenty of reasons, but I’ll start with these: If you or your loved one has been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, you or your loved one could become metastatic sometime down the road. Just because a person is diagnosed at an early stage, this does not mean her/his cancer cannot potentially metastasize and become stage IV later on. And this can happen even many years later. This is not meant to be a scare tactic; it is meant to be fact sharing. Some women and men are diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer at initial diagnosis. Being diagnosed at any stage is tough, but being diagnosed stage IV right out of the gate is beyond tough. Way beyond. And it does not mean the person did anything wrong. The stigma of not catching it early has to end. It must end. In order to discover effective ways to prevent, detect and treat metastases, we need to extensively research everything about stage IV. We need to try to figure out why some cancers metastasize, how to slow it down when it does happen, or better yet how to stop it in its tracks. We also need to figure out better and less harsh treatment options for those living with stage IV now. We need more research dollars spent specifically on mets-related research. Lots more. It’s only logical to support those in greatest need, is it not? Stage IV women and men deserve MORE support, not less, which ironically has often been the case in awareness campaigns of past and in research dollar allotments as well. We simply cannot allow this to be the case any longer. All breast cancer patients matter. We need to fully embrace, include and advocate for our stage IV sisters and brothers because we are all in this together and because it’s the right thing to do. Advocating for those with metastatic breast cancer is very important to me. My mother died from metastatic breast cancer in 2008. Her cancer was detected early, “only” a stage II cancer four years earlier. A lumpectomy and radiation were supposed to be enough. They weren’t. I have had too many friends die from this disease as well. Too many families have been impacted by metastatic breast cancer, just too many. #DontIgnoreStageIV and #MetsMonday are two popular hashtags on social media that connect people with information and support about stage IV breast cancer. I will not forget. I cannot forget. None of us should. It is the responsibility of all who are able to advocate for our stage IV sisters and brothers. We need everyone’s voice. We need everyone’s efforts to move the conversation and the research efforts along. So this October, or any time of year for that matter, start a conversation with someone. Need ideas on how to do that? Try simply asking, “Did you know?” Help others “know,” Help others understand. Because as so many of us have been saying for quite some time now, Breast cancer awareness without mets awareness, isn’t awareness at all. Join the conversation. Share the hashtag #beyondthebreast. Help make change happen. Read more of Nancy’s insight on breast cancer at Nancy’s Point.",0,1,0.14854818594104305
107,23,41,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Mandi Hudson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. In 2014, the cancer came back and she was diagnosed with stage IV disease. Read her story and learn how you can get involved with the Beyond The Breast Campaign. Breast cancer has been a part of my life for almost 5 years now, it is an unwanted “houseguest”, and I would be happy if it would leave! Alas, I have metastatic breast cancer – this houseguest wants to stay and will take my life. I was diagnosed with stage IIb breast cancer December 30, 2010. The day before my 31 st birthday. I discovered a lump while showering, which is embarrassing because I want to say I was super vigilant and found it! That wasn’t the case. I had had a lump tested in that breast before, so I wasn’t as worried, I was only 30. I knew the process for checking it out and got it going. My husband Mike decided to go with me to the diagnostic ultrasound, we started to fret right before the procedure, so he came to hold my hand. During the ultrasound the tech gave us a panicked look and left the room. The radiologist came in shortly after and looked at it and told us it was definitely cancer. They then proceeded to do my first and last REAL mammogram (we did a fake on years later to look at scar tissue, it didn’t work). I had them take the biopsies and they sent us on our less than merry way. When I finally got to see my medical team they found a tumor in my lymph node and offered me two routes: Chemo first or surgery first. They told me my outcome would likely be the same (I look back at it now and wonder if I should have started with chemo so that I could see what it did to the tumors). I chose surgery because I wanted the cancer out of my body as soon as humanly possible. I had a bilateral nipple and skin-sparing mastectomy with expanders placed. I proceeded to chemo, a few extra surgeries because my mastectomy refused to heal and then off to the burn machine –cough – I mean radiation. I had my breast reconstruction December 27, 2011. That squished everything into one tidy deductible/max out of pocket insurance year. Unfortunately it wasn’t completely tidy. My back started causing me problems, but nothing showed up on the scans. A couple of years later a cough that just wouldn’t stop ended up earning me a CT that showed several lung nodules. They were too small to biopsy and too small to confirm cancer on a PET-CT. So we watched them, and they grew, just a few teensy millimeters every few months. Just enough to mostly know… My back started to get worse and my quarterly CT had more than just lung nodules. It showed actual holes in my spine. The PET-CT revealed tumors in 6 vertebrae, my clavicle, ribs, and lymph nodes in my chest. After my oophorectomy we discovered I had tiny tumors hiding in both ovaries. A new test showed that my cancer not only spread, but it changed. I started as ER/PR-positive HER2-negative, and my metastatic tumors in my bones were now ER-positive, PR-negative, and HER2-positive. My official re-diagnosis was October 6, 2014. We tried letrozole to no avail, new tumors showed up in my spine and I just wasn’t feeling good. We then pulled out the big guns. Taxotere/Herceptin/Perjeta – my saviors for some time. Eight infusions and my tumor markers dropped into the lovely land of normal and most of my mets became inactive. The latest scan of my spine showed the cancer almost completely gone. The ones in my lungs hung on tight though. We recently took me off chemo and my tumor markers are creeping up. The cancer looks like it may be spreading again. In a month we will scan and verify that this is the case and decide what treatment is in store for me next. This is my life. One treatment until it stops working, then the next one. Cancer whack-a-mole. When your cancer is #beyondthebreast you do everything that you can to survive and enjoy every moment. The reality is that approximately 20-30% of women with early stage cancers will end up with metastatic breast cancer. Early detection saves some lives, but not all lives. Until there is a cure for metastatic breast cancer, there is no cure for breast cancer. Donate to research that is focused on metastatic breast cancer, my life depends on it.

108,23,42,21,9,2015,2015-09-21,"Beth Caldwell, on finding out she was de novo metastatic, coping with diagnosis and the benefits of community. Learn more about resources and support for metastatic breast cancer from our Beyond The Breast campaign. Like a lot of women, I found my lump in the shower. At age 37, I was too young for routine mammograms, and I didn’t have a family history of breast cancer, so I did self-breast exams every two months, and of course I’d never found a lump before. This one was clearly something to be worried about – it felt like there was a kid’s rubber bouncy ball in there. I went off to work that day trying to pretend everything was fine, but I knew it wasn’t, and after work, I told my husband about it and let him feel the lump. He told me “We got this,” and hugged me while I cried. The next morning, I called to make a doctor appointment, and the diagnosis process began. Where my story differs from the typical breast cancer diagnosis story is that as I was about to be wheeled in for my port surgery, my surgeon told me that my PET scan had shown that my cancer had already spread beyond my breast, to my hip and sternum. About 6-10% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are what we call de novo metastatic, which means they were metastatic from the start, like mine. For us, that means that when we’re done having all those tests that come with finding a lump, we also find out that our cancer is incurable. As we drove home from the hospital that day, both of us crying, I turned to my husband and said, “How can this be happening? I just found the lump two weeks ago.” And he said, “Let’s ask your doctor that question when we see him tomorrow.” So I did, and he looked me straight in the eye and said, “There is nothing you could have done to prevent this.” It turned out that my cancer was very aggressive and grew very quickly. It came down to this: sometimes these things just happen. It’s just one of those things. It can be hard to wrap your brain around the idea that something so catastrophic as a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer can be just one of those things. Lots of patients search for answers, and too often we blame ourselves. Maybe if I’d had kids younger, maybe if I’d eaten more organic food, maybe if I’d lost some weight, maybe if I’d had that mammogram sooner…the maybes can drive you crazy. But the reality is, sometimes cancer is just this aggressive. Sometimes, despite our best efforts to take care of ourselves, we just get sick. For those of us whose breast cancer was metastatic from diagnosis, we can feel a bit isolated from the broader breast cancer community, because our experience of our disease is different. We don’t get to celebrate the end of treatment, because treatment never ends. We don’t have to try to put our lives back together after cancer, because for us, there is no “after cancer.” We know from the beginning of our cancer experience that we will die of or with our disease. This is why it’s so important for those of us with metastatic breast cancer to connect with others with our disease. It’s so much easier to cope with the challenges and struggles that we face when we can talk to others who face those same challenges and struggles. We come from all different walks of life, but we share an experience that shapes us in similar ways. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer that’s spread beyond the breast, Living Beyond Breast Cancer has some amazing resources for connecting with others who have metastatic disease and I highly recommend checking them out. Although you may feel different from other people with breast cancer, you’re not alone!

We’re taking over social media to talk about an important and often overlooked topic – metastatic or stage IV breast cancer. Because stage IV breast cancer is not the same as stages 0, I, II or III. Metastatic breast cancer means that cancer that originated in the breast has spread to another part of the body – most commonly the brain, bones, liver or lungs. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer and those diagnosed with this stage of disease will be in treatment for the rest of their lives. I know because I’m living with metastatic breast cancer. Like the tens of thousands of others who are also affected by metastatic disease, breast cancer isn’t something I’m “aware” of only during the month of October. For me, for us, breast cancer awareness is every minute, of every day, of every week, of every month of every year. We want our voices to be heard, too. Throughout the day, Beyond the Breast will give voice to what a stage IV diagnosis really means, using the stories of real women and men impacted by it. We need you to help spread word of the campaign and share its messages, as well as your own, on social media and encourage those in your network to do the same while using #BeyondTheBreast. Regardless of the how you have been personally affected by breast cancer, you can help make Beyond The Breast a social media phenomenon. In addition to sharing our information and your experiences, you can also get involved by taking photos with these signs: Visit lbbc.org/beyondthebreast to download and print these campaign signs. After you print the sign or signs that work best for you, hold them near where your breast cancer has metastasized and take a selfie or have someone snap a picture of you. Then post it on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram using #BeyondTheBreast. If you’d like, get friends and family to join you. See Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to discover how others are using the signs. This is really important. We need your help and are calling on all of you to take action. Please check out lbbc.org/beyondthebreast to learn more about this campaign.

111,23,45,15,9,2015,2015-09-15,"Living Beyond Breast Cancer Development Projects Coordinator Christina Meehan on how LympheDIVAs made a difference in her life after she experienced mild lymphedema. Shop at LympheDIVAs to support LBBC! After finishing the majority of my treatment for stage IV breast cancer, I was really looking forward to not looking “sick.” I didn’t need any more people staring at me for being bald at age 31 or for missing a breast at age 32. I wanted to blend in as much as possible and had a hard time looking people in the eye when I was in public. “Yes, I have cancer,” I would think to myself. “Have you never seen someone with cancer or is it that you never saw a 30-something woman with cancer? Either way, please stop looking at me with that pitiful expression.” At a follow up appointment with my oncologist, he noticed that my right arm (same side as my surgery) was a bit swollen and referred me to a lymphedema specialist. I never heard of lymphedema but soon realized that I had a mild case. I had to see the lymphedema specialist three times a week – usually at 6:30 in the morning to fit around my work schedule. She was my age so at least we had that in common. We would chat while she massaged and stretched my arm and when I would use that silly hand bike thing in the gym (I still don’t know what the point of that machine is). Anyway, after a few sessions she told me it was time to order my sleeve. “Come again?” I asked her. She pulled out this brownish sleeve that A.) was ugly and B.) looked like half a leg of a Spanx shaper. To my horrid surprise, I was supposed to wear this hideous thing all day, every day – that is, if I didn’t want to wrap my arm with six Ace bandages (which I did three times and looked like Frankenstein when he walked around with his arms out – but in my case an arm). Talk about options! I was crushed. I wanted to blend in not look like a brown monster. Plus, I had gained weight during treatment so my arm looked like an encased sausage. I hated wearing the sleeve. To be honest, I often didn’t wear it – not only because it was awful but because it was hot and would always roll down my arm, cutting off my circulation. Even though I lied to the lymphedema specialist she could tell from my arm that I wasn’t wearing the sleeve. She told me about another company that makes lymphedema sleeves called LympheDIVAs. When I saw their products, which look like tattoos in my opinion, I was so excited. There were so many fun and feminine designs. I remember saying to the lymphedema specialist, “can I order five?” Trust me when I say it’s soooo much better than the crappy brown thing I originally had. It doesn’t roll down my arm, hence my circulation continues There are so many fun designs that choosing just one is hard Even though it provides enough compression, I’m not nearly as hot wearing it I think I look pretty bad ass wearing it When I’m at the gym it’s not nearly as hot and gross as the “brown thing.” To sum up, the LympheDIVAs sleeve gave me some of my confidence back that cancer took from me. I realized this last month when I was putting my sleeve on in an airport. People were blatantly staring and turning around to see what I was doing. Without any hesitation I loudly and proudly stated, “Nothing to see here people. It’s just a cool lymphedema sleeve, no need for photos.” Take that cancer.

112,23,46,13,9,2015,2015-09-13,"Dawn Bontempo on living life after a breast cancer diagnosis. On my one-year anniversary of finishing treatments, I ran a 5K and got a tattoo…. The 5K was probably not as shocking to my friends and family as the tattoo, but there was something surreal about the days leading up to June 7, 2014, that led me to do something that was symbolic of the new me – the me that kicked cancer’s butt and was leading a fearless life. To understand what brought me to that point, I should probably take you back to Oct 12, 2012; the day the radiologist called to tell me that I had breast cancer. Let me tell you – being diagnosed at 41 years old sucked! There is no history of breast cancer in my family and I knew only a handful of women who were survivors. I was anxious; I was overwhelmed; and I was more scared than I had ever been in my entire life. But, I was still me and this girl uses sarcasm and humor and views the world through rose-colored glasses. Within a couple days of diagnosis, I announced to the world via Facebook that I had cancer. Did you read that? I announced via an ‘I have cancer’ Facebook post. Yes, yes I did! Even I look back now and wonder what I was thinking, but it mobilized a support team and I started my journey. I endured a lumpectomy, eight rounds of chemotherapy, and 34 radiation treatments before declaring victory on June 7, 2013. What have I learned in the last two years? Laugh often and laugh loudly Be bold and be fearless Laugh often and laugh loudly – I come from an Italian family where loud is just expected. I was certainly a positive person before cancer, but each laugh and each moment of joy is so much more precious now. I often tell folks to find something that brings them joy and do it often! For me, that has manifested in mentoring and coaching. It brings me immense joy to encourage and assist folks in realizing their goals and dreams. Be bold and be fearless – in the last two years, I have traveled overseas on a solo vacation to the El Camino de Santiago; I have walked the Avon39; and I have flung myself into many new and exciting experiences. Just go out and do it is my advice! It sounds a lot like a Nike ad, but I can’t express it any better. Every new experience and every new adventure makes me stronger and makes me enjoy life even more. I often tell folks who are recently diagnosed that being a breast cancer survivor is a sorority you never wanted to be a part of, but there are a lot of really awesome women in it. Now, go out and fearlessly fling yourself into the world! Dawn Bontempo is the author of the book, Breast Cancer Mardi Gras: Surviving the Emotional Hurricane and Showing My Boobs to Strangers.

113,23,47,10,9,2015,2015-09-10,"In this installment of The Whole You, Sarita Joy Jordan writes about finding a passion for exercise and maintaining healthy living practices after diagnosis. Read other posts from this Wellness Weekend blog series and join us for this three day event that’s just for you! I was diagnosed with stage I breast cancer in 2005. It was a very difficult road, but I made it through. I had to figure out my new normal. Since 2007, I have participated in many conferences, forums and workshops involving wellness after my initial breast cancer diagnosis. In 2012, I fell off the healthy living wagon and shifted in daily practices that I knew to be normal. Like starting my mornings off with coffee that was way too sweet. Eating fried foods and take-out for lunch and dessert for snacks. And then, to top it off, having a high-calorie filled dinner and plenty of Pepsi. The more I ate, the more pounds I packed on. The more I sat, the more difficult it became to get up and move something. I suffered from depression and was saddened about my inabilities. I joined a Biggest Loser program at my neighborhood Y. I was assigned a personal trainer and began to learn how to be accountable for what I ate. I also was introduced to a nutritionist, who showed me how to make adjustments to my diet. Although, I didn’t win the contest, I completed the weight loss challenge with a renewed zest to live healthy. I joined a running group and began to excel in running; 5k’s, 10k’s and even completing several half marathons. I didn’t know that this wellness choice would ultimately save my life. You see, in 2013, my cancer returned. I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer with metastasis to the liver, bones, skull base, left ovary and right axilla. I truly believe that if I had not been running and made these pivotal changes to my diet, I would have been in a dire situation at this second diagnosis. I had no pre-existing comorbidities. I finally understand the importance of wellness. Facing a diagnosis like this, it was now more important than ever to maintain my overall wellness. Building onto what I already learned from the Biggest Loser program, I participated in Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Eating Well After Breast Cancer program, held in partnership with MANNA. This program increased my knowledge about nutrition after breast cancer, and showed me simple and satisfying recipes I could make in my own kitchen. I just completed 26 rounds of chemotherapy, and I exercised and participated in classes at the gym during treatment. I was able to utilize the Livestrong program (www.livestrong.org), which is a 12 -week program at the gym, specifically designed for cancer patients. I participated in yoga, rowing class, ran on the treadmill, walked the trails, water therapy and exercise, Zumba, etc. I recently spent a week kayaking with a program called First Descents (www.firstdescents.org). in Mt. Hood, OR. This was an adventure of a lifetime. I recently completed a 5k walk/run and a 4.5mile walk/run with my local church, which was a goal that I set for myself. Although I will be in treatment for the rest of my life, movement will also be my medicine. My interest in exercise and healthy living is why I am so excited for the upcoming Wellness Weekend in Denver, CO, with LBBC. I am especially looking forward to Yoga on the Steps: Denver. I participated in Yoga on the Steps: Philadelphia for the first time this year and I joined Jewel Ajibade’s and Amy Lessack’s team, Thrivin’ and Survivin’. Participating on this team with them was life-changing, uplifting and inspiring., I started to understand that mind, body and soul need to be in-sync at all times – Namaste! You know, had I not made the connection between the importance of diet and exercise, I might not be alive today and able to share my experiences with you via this blog. I am looking forward to being reacquainted with my fellow Hear My Voice: Metastatic Breast Cancer Outreach volunteers, at the annual fall conference participants, women LIVING with metastatic disease and being able to connect and encourage other women who may be living with an early-stage diagnosis. We are all on this breast cancer journey together and may just need a little motivation to get off the couch. This September 18-20 weekend can offer the motivation we need. Any movement is beneficial and there are so many options to incorporate wellness while dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis and beyond. Join us for a weekend of connection, information and inspiration. Sarita Joy Jordan is a retired supervisor from the Department of Public Welfare and most recently, Temple University Hospital as a patient navigator. She is more than 9 years past her initial breast cancer diagnosis and was diagnosed with metastatic disease in 2013. Though she is in active treatment, Sarita continues her role as a patient advocate and volunteer, most recently as a Living Beyond Breast Cancer Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer. Her life purpose is to educate, motivate and encourage women to live beyond a breast cancer diagnosis.",0,1,0.20710530141500294

As a healthy, happy, vegan-eating, marathon-running, 39-year-old young mother with absolutely no family history of breast cancer, being diagnosed with the disease in 2010 literally shattered my world. As a health care professional, I very quickly moved from the side of the hospital bed into the hospital bed. This transition from nurse to patient taught me profound life lessons. Lesson #1: Honor the feelings and let them out. Prior to my experience with breast cancer, I was a grin-and-bear it kind of girl who was reluctant to share any feeling other than joy. However, once ‘Roid Rage (the intense feelings of anger brought on by pre-chemotherapy steroids) and Chemo-Sobby (tears at the drop of a hat brought on by the chemotherapy flowing through my veins), and the Freight Train of Fatigue (courtesy of the rads of radiation beamed into my body) entered my life, I had no choice but to let all of my feelings out. I was too exhausted to muster the energy to make them look “pretty.” And you know what? Expressing feelings, all feelings, happens to feel good. Really good. Though I no longer have ‘Roid Rage, Chemo-Sobby or the Freight Train of Fatigue (thank goodness!), I continue to openly express my feelings. And it still feels good! No, actually, it feels great!

115,23,49,13,8,2015,2015-08-13,"In this post for our Wellness Weekend series, The Whole You, Ayanna Kalasunas writes about how meditation and yoga helped her after she learned she had metastatic breast cancer. Understand how cancer impacts you physically, emotionally and spiritually during Wellness Weekend, taking place September 18-20 in Denver, CO. Let’s face it – hearing “you have cancer” is one of the scariest moments of anyone’s life. A metastatic breast cancer diagnosis two and a half years ago on the day I was set to start chemo was downright earth-shattering. I, like many others, asked myself “how the hell am I supposed to handle this?” Having battled depression and anxiety in the past, I was truly concerned about the coping mechanisms I would need. I felt lost, angry, afraid and hopeless. Then I thought about my mother. She too had been diagnosed metastatic after a stage II battle seven years earlier. She maintained a zest for life and continued to be the life of the party despite various bouts of chemo, radiation and multiple surgeries. She had cancer and I was aware of that but she was so much more than her disease. My now husband once commented about her saying “I honestly forget that she is sick. Not in a bad way…she is just so fun and happy all the time.” Thinking about this reminded me that I could do it, too. I was also very lucky to have a few close friends that used meditation and yoga as part of their regular routines. Part of their support as caregivers was offering information and resources regarding meditation, mindfulness, acupuncture and other complimentary therapies to my medical treatments, which I continue to pick up along this journey. Each one has grounded me and brought me to a life that is filled with hope, positive thinking and empowerment. I did not morph into this person overnight. I read a few articles here and there, followed some inspiring people on social media, went to a yoga class with a friend here and there and spent a few Sundays super-souling on my sofa with a cup of coffee. I tried some mediation challenges and apps and slowly have found a sense of power in each of these moments. I learned that I am in fact in complete control. Cancer is in my body so yes, it is real, but I am not my circumstances. Continue reading →",0,1,0.03788197097020627
116,23,5,21,3,2016,2016-03-21,"In 1991, Living Beyond Breast Cancer was formed when Marisa C. Weiss, MD, a radiation oncologist, held a conference with the help of some of her patients. Their goal was to provide a safe space where women could gain accurate and easy-to-understand breast cancer information from medical experts, while finding and connecting with each other. Margaux Jacks (nee Garbowski) is the daughter of one of those patients. This is the first of her two-part story for the Living Beyond Breast Cancer 25th Anniversary Blog Series. It was 1980, and I was four when my parents sat me down at our kitchen table in our ranch home in the suburbs of Philadelphia to have a talk. While I can’t recall everything that was said, one detail that would impact my life in ways I could never imagine at such a young age was when my parents brought up the “c word.” In that moment, my life changed in a profound way. Ahead of me would be a mix of highs and lows, so many sweet moments, and yet so many other terrifying ones. Whether we liked it or not, we were in for the roller coaster ride that is a cancer diagnosis. At the age of four, I didn’t ask about my Mom, Nancy S. Garbowski, living or dying. And I was unaware that Mom could die. I knew she was going to the hospital, and hospitals made people better, right? She would be ok, the doctors would fix her, that’s what doctors do. I drew her a card to take to the hospital, on construction paper, with pretty flowers and signed it with love. I can’t imagine what was going through my Mom’s mind. She always seemed so calm about it with me. She must have been so scared, as her Mom had died of metastatic breast cancer when she was four; her Mom was just the young age of 31. Was history going to repeat itself? When she came home, I saw her scar from the amputation. In my little voice, I called it the train tracks. It was one long red line about one-half to one-inch thick in sections that went from the center of her chest all the way into her armpit. It had equally thick cross lines, same red that gave it the train track look. She smiled at my observation. I’m guessing she enjoyed my innocence. Mom healed and life went on. She didn’t talk about cancer with me. When the next one came, I was a few years older, and understood more. When Mom was not feeling well, we would hunker down as a family — helping each other with all the routine chores of life, while making sure Mom was as comfortable as possible. While Mom, Dad and I bonded in such a profound way, there were also consequences, as it was stressful to be the main support for someone. Plus, I could not relate to how she was feeling. I could not provide any support in the huge decisions she faced with her treatment. My Dad shouldered a lot when it came to being there for my Mom. We handled it together as a family. Her cancer allowed us an opportunity to share many intimate experiences, many girls would not share with their Mom at that age. During chemo I would help her walk outside and together we would blow clumps of her hair into the wind. As the locks of her hair would carry through the air, we would make a wish. I can recall the twinkle in her eyes. She was so proud to have given me life, even as hers was ending. I held the family secret for years. I never told anyone, not a friend, not a neighbor. Finally, one day sitting with one of my best friends playing cards in our cabin at sleep away camp, I said it: “My Mom has cancer.” It felt so weird to utter the words — to see her reaction, her understanding of the seriousness of something like this. And that was it. I didn’t speak of it again for quite some time. It felt awkward to reveal something that was deeply private. My Mom kept it mostly private too. I’m not sure how she processed all that she was enduring. But then she met someone who would help her in ways none of us imagined. Nancy didn’t know it, but she and a small group of fellow patients were about to help in the creation of something that would forever change the way women diagnosed with breast cancer could access trustable information and connect with a community they could depend on. Margaux’s story concludes with the second part of her blog which will be published later this week.",0,1,0.11268911210317462
117,23,50,6,8,2015,2015-08-06,"In anticipation of our August 12 webinar on environmental health, Health Educator Margot White blogs about why she founded The Choosy Chick. I have always believed in the benefit of leading a healthy lifestyle, but becoming a mom inspired me to turn it up a notch. Like most parents, I wanted to provide my children with a healthy foundation and protect them from chemicals that did not belong in their bodies. After my first son was born I began to realize I was only scratching the surface. I had a lot to learn about food additives, dyes, artificial flavors and sweeteners, preservatives and chemicals with unpronounceable names. The more I learned, the more I distrusted the well-known brands that were a major part of our diet. My kids even picked up on my new habit. Imagine my embarrassment when my 6 year old blurted out at a birthday party, “Hey Mom, there’s high fructose corn syrup in these fruit snacks!” By the time my second and third sons came along, I began to learn about the chemicals not just in foods, but in cleaning and personal care products. I became more suspicious about toxins in skincare products when my son became ill during the application of one of those Halloween face painting kits. His throat started to burn and he vomited white foam. When I looked at the back of the product label, I noticed the warning to avoid using certain colors near the eyes or mouth. But wait – this was a FACIAL makeup kit! How could it possibly create this kind of reaction? All along I was experiencing some unexplained rashes, and developed Raynaud’s syndrome. My doctor started to watch me closely for Lupus, among other autoimmune diseases. During that same period several close friends and family members were diagnosed with cancer. I became concerned for the health of my family and myself. I became a mom on a mission committed to reducing our exposure to toxins in foods and household products. I started to investigate the ingredients in diaper creams, lotions, and baby shampoo and again, found good reason to distrust the brands I once thought were safe. I had already discovered that my own makeup and personal care products were loaded with toxic chemicals that are linked to a variety of serious health concerns.

118,23,51,4,8,2015,2015-08-04,"Contributor Joanne Hampton blogs about the importance of speaking up about your concerns and sharing them with your healthcare provider. I moved from New York to Florida 6 years ago and on a recent visit to NY I was compelled to visit my oncologist. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 33. My children were 2 and 5 at the time, the ages where mommy isn’t allowed to be sick. I didn’t know anyone who had breast cancer. I was so alone and scared. I didn’t know what any of it meant or what to expect. This was 11 years ago when I felt it was shameful to say breast cancer and the internet offered little information. What I did know was I had two beautiful children who needed their mom. Joanne Hampton with her oncologist, Dr. Buchholtz. I put my life in the hands of my oncologist, Dr. Michael Buchholtz. He took me into his office for over an hour and explained as much as he could to me. Looking back, I remember the sweet tone of his voice and his kind and positive words. He made it easy for me to understand what was going to happen and what to expect. I realized I wasn’t alone and I wasn’t so afraid. He gave me that. I knew he wasn’t going to give up on me and I was going to be ok. I don’t know how else to explain it except to say I could feel his heart, as strange as that may sound. If you have gone through chemotherapy, or if you haven’t, it’s a place we visit so often for treatment, blood work, follow up, shots, and if I have forgotten anything else, I’ll just blame it on chemobrain. In an odd way, the treatment center becomes almost like a second home, but a positive is you’re on a first name basis with almost everyone in the office. I remember one day when I was having an especially rough time, Liz, one of the nurses, was kind enough to go out to her car and brought me a CD of soothing music and some headphones. It was small gestures and support like this that made a difficult experience a little more bearable. Finally, treatment, surgeries, and radiation were over, and I was a few months out when I felt that I heard a whisper. This whisper gave me the feeling that something was wrong and I wasn’t going to see my children grow up. I shared this feeling with a friend who said that after the scare and all I had been through, it was a normal fear to have. Family members felt it was time for me to close the book on cancer, put it behind me and move on. All this seemed reasonable. I had been through a lot. It was normal to be afraid, and it was over so I should be moving on. But the whisper continued. Was it my own fears? Was it intuition? Or was it a message from a higher place warning me? Honestly, that is what I felt–that someone up there was trying to tell me something. You can imagine how crazy I sounded when I told people, and trust me it was only a select few. When it came time for me to return to my oncologist for a checkup, all tests showed I was perfectly fine. Before he left the room Dr. Buchholtz looked at me and asked how I was feeling. I paused and I thought, well, he might put me on some loony meds, but I had to tell him about my concerns. I said, “This might be crazy, but I am having this feeling that something is still wrong and I am going to die young.” He looked into my eyes and told me I was not crazy. I wish I could remember the exact words he used, because it was beautiful. He told me about a new test that I qualified for. He explained it was a genetic test for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. He had me sit with one of the nurses and go over my family history of cancer. He took my blood and sent it on to be tested. It turned out I was positive for the BRCA1 mutation. With this mutation, the percentage of possible recurrence is about 87%. I was also found to be triple negative which means a recurrence would bring about a much more aggressive cancer. In life, I believe if we all look back we have people that I like to refer to as angels. They are put in our path for a purpose – whether they held our hand or were our source of strength when we needed it most. Dr. Buchholtz was the only one who listened to me and from the very beginning. He touched my heart in a way that I needed most. I’m not just grateful –I love this man with his beautiful soul and heart of gold, and I can’t thank him enough for taking care of me the way he did. I am so glad I had the strength to speak up and voice my concerns. So please, do not be afraid or embarrassed because asking questions and listening to your instinct is not silly or dumb. It could save your life. It did for me.

119,23,52,21,7,2015,2015-07-21,"Flashback Friday: Randi Rentz’s summer 2015 post from our blogging series, The Whole You, which focuses on a side effect that impacts a number of women in treatment for breast cancer– menopause. Get tips for coping with menopausal symptoms during our Twitter Chat on February 24, 2016, Heated Topic: Menopausal Symptoms and You. Ah, summertime. Long, sunny days. Outdoor cookouts. Lounging by the pool. Say what??? Make that: Long, sweaty days. Internal cook-offs. Lunging for the pool. Summer can be difficult if you’re in the midst of perimenopause or menopause. Geez! I first experienced menopausal experiences while receiving chemo. It got worse once I went on tamoxifen. I also had to have a hysterectomy, which totally threw me for a loop. That procedure, of course, put me in permanent SCREAMING and KICKING menopause. For those of you who have experienced menopause – naturally occurring or induced by cancer treatment – you know exactly what I mean when I say that hot flashes absolutely STINK!! Not only do they rock your world in a moment’s notice with absolutely no warning, but they (at least mine) are all consuming and utterly UNCOMFORTABLE! Well, let me be more specific: the truth of the matter is that my mind is a wasteland of emptiness during which I am at a complete and total loss of words when a hot flash comes on. They so overwhelm me. Irritability, mood swings, sudden burst of crying. They’re all part of this new phase in my life. I am now menopause symptomatic (a.k.a. Itchy, Bitchy, Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful and Psycho). The number one symptom for me: hot flashes, cold flashes and night sweats. Now, these aren’t the sweats of relaxation you’d feel in a sauna, or the rewarding ones indicating you’ve just exercised This is more like: OMG, I’m on F%$#ing fire. Call 9-1-1….Nooow!

Almost 3 years ago, my life changed forever when I heard those awful words, “You have stage III invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer.” Breast cancer? Stage III? How is that even possible? Those are the immediate thoughts that raced through my mind. Will I survive? What will life be like after? I’m excited to tell you that in addition to advances in research and care, which have made early-stage breast cancer, mostly curable, there are also many exceptional programs to help you get your life back after diagnosis. Living Beyond Breast Cancer offers many of these programs including webinars, seminars, a conference, and my personal favorite Yoga on the Steps. LBBC has an amazing team that wants to help you navigate life after diagnosis. Many organizations raise money for treatments and to deal with the health aspect, but there are so many additional challenges that a survivor must face including financial and mental health issues. The stress of having cancer and what’s to come can overtake you if you let it. LBBC is here to help you face these outlying issues and treat the whole person, mind and body. I attended my first Yoga on the Steps in Denver, about a year after my diagnosis. At that time, I had finished chemo, a double mastectomy and radiation. I also had the opportunity to share my story, which can also be therapeutic, or at least it was for me. At that point, I still looked like a survivor and didn’t feel like myself, but participating in an event with such a wonderful group of people as the sun comes up is not only refreshing and calming, but a fun way to start your day. I hope that you will join us for Yoga on the Steps in Kansas City and/or Denver. I would love to meet you and hear your story. And if you’re new to yoga or LBBC, I’d love for you to join us for this inspiring outdoor event. Yoga is a great way to not just help you physically deal with some of the new obstacles through stretching and even just getting some exercise, but also helps to relax you…something that is just as important. Someone asked me the other day if cancer defines me. I thought it was an odd question. I responded “no.” Cancer doesn’t define me. It’s a part of who I am now and has changed me, but I get to decide what defines me. Cancer is just one of the many things that have shaped my life. You never know if and when you might here those words, “you have cancer”, and I hope you don’t. If you ever do, you will be appreciative of organizations like LBBC and the sense of community that they bring. Cancer is a lonely disease. Surrounding yourself with others who have been there gives you something that you can’t get from your friends and family who haven’t been there. No matter how much someone loves you and thinks they know what you’re going through, they cannot possibly understand. I love all of those who tried, but I know even with family members who had cancer, I never fully comprehended what the journey was like until I lived it. Please join me in supporting this wonderful organization that gives so much back to the community.

These days I’m a lopsided B-kinda-C cup. Unfortunately, a botched boob job isn’t to blame. Instead, I was diagnosed with the “Big C” in July 2013 at the age of 31. My lopsidedness comes from a mastectomy to remove my right breast and a breast reduction in my left breast. I thought I had a hard time finding bras when I had two DDD breasts; one breast and a prosthesis is even harder! When I was diagnosed I thought two things: there is only one type of breast cancer and young women certainly don’t get it. I soon learned, however, that while I did, in fact, have breast cancer, I had a rare type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer. I never heard of it; my mother, a nurse for 30 years never heard of it, and doctors can go through their entire careers without seeing a case. How can this be? Last month I attended Jefferson University Hospitals’ inaugural Inflammatory Breast Cancer Conference for the Community. More than 80 people attended including other women with the disease and healthcare professionals. Based on information from the conference and my personal experience, here’s what I think you should know: What is IBC? IBC occurs when cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels in the skin covering the breast. Symptoms include: The skin can become thick, red, itchy and dimpled like an orange (peau d’orange is the technical term). The breast can appear swollen, bruised or darkened. The breast may feel heavy or full, warm to the touch, painful or tender. The nipple of the breast can also invert (push in) or appear flattened. These symptoms also describe an infection of the breast called mastitis. Very often women who go to their doctor with these symptoms receive antibiotics, especially those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Continue reading →",0,1,0.02059082892416225
123,23,56,30,6,2015,2015-06-30,"Hear My Voice Outreach volunteer Maggie Kudirka started #TheTurningChallenge to help raise research funds and awareness of resources for metastatic breast cancer. One year ago, when I was 23 years old, I learned that I have metastatic breast cancer that has spread to my sternum, spine, and pelvis. Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from its original location to another body part. It is sometimes called advanced cancer or stage 4 cancer. I am among the 10% of women who are initially diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. It was the last thing I expected. Other than being female, I have none of the risk factors for breast cancer: I am very young, thin, physically active and fit. I have never used any hormonal medications; I don’t smoke, drink, or use drugs; I eat a healthy diet. Genetic testing indicated I do not carry the breast cancer genes. But, I have metastatic breast cancer. Metastasis is what makes breast cancer a deadly disease. It is the leading cause of death in young women with breast cancer. In fact, every day 108 American women die from metastatic breast cancer. This is over 40,000 women each year and this number has held steady for the last 15 years. If a cure is not found soon, one day it will be me. Billions of dollars are raised for breast cancer, but only 2% goes toward research to find a cure for metastatic breast cancer. Most of the money raised is spent on awareness, early detection, and treatments for early stages of breast cancer. Early detection does not guarantee a cure, and successfully treating early-stage breast cancer does not mean that one never has to worry about cancer again. Metastatic breast cancer can occur many years after the patient’s original diagnosis and treatment. Until a cure is found for metastatic breast cancer, no one with breast cancer can ever be certain that they are cured, even after both breasts have been removed and no cancer is detected following surgery. Our current technology cannot detect whether very tiny breast cancer stem cells have traveled to a new body part. These cancer cells sometimes begin growing after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have been completed. In fact, this will happen to about 30% of the women who were successfully treated for early stages of breast cancer. Months, years, or even decades later, they will develop stage 4 breast cancer and die. It is a possibility that no one wants to talk about. It is the elephant in every breast cancer patient’s room. Please help raise awareness and funds for metastatic breast cancer research by joining me in the Turning Challenge. Let’s send a message to breast cancer fundraising operations to turn around and look at us Stage 4 patients; we deserve more than 2 percent. I started the Turning Challenge as part of my work as a Hear My Voice Outreach volunteer for Living Beyond Breast Cancer. I knew I wanted my outreach project to combine a fun activity with my passion for raising funds for metastatic breast cancer and educating people about the disease. The Turning Challenge can be fun for everyone: both dancers and non-dancers. All that you have to do is post a video of spinning or rotating in some fashion. It can be as simple as the Hokie Pokie or as difficult as 32 fouettes. You can hold a spinning object like a pinwheel or film your pet dog chasing his tail. There are no rules! Inspire, entertain, amuse – or just make us smile! Be creative! Please use #TheTurningChallenge and nominate three or more friends. If you prefer not to complete the challenge, please make a donation to METAvivor where 100% of your donation will go to metastatic breast cancer research. Also, visit LBBC.ORG to learn more about metastatic breast cancer and resources available to people living with the disease. Share this information with people living with stage IV breast cancer.

124,23,57,26,6,2015,2015-06-26,"Jessica Karabian is an LBBC Young Advocate. A version of this post appeared in her blog, Eyes up here, this is beyond my breast. Learn about our Fall 2015 Young Advocate Program. My name is Jessica Karabian, and I have Stage IV metastatic breast cancer. It sounds like an introduction to an AA meeting to me, but to others (to the healthy ones) it sounds like a warrior call. For two years, I’ve lived in a world where there were two groups of people: People with cancer and people without cancer. I have a story. It’s long–full of twist and turns. My story has a baby and a separated marriage, good relationships and bad relationships, endless doctors appointments and two separate diagnoses. It is complicated, but so is the story of anyone who has been diagnosed with cancer. Let’s be honest: If you have heard the words “You have cancer,” from that point on, life no longer goes smoothly. So once I heard that life changing sentence, the tug-o-war in my mind began. Every day, every hour, every minute it tugged in my mind. Am I living or am I dying? At 29 years young, I became fixated on if I was living with cancer or dying from cancer. Not the sentence I thought would be replaying in my mind like a scratched record player. So, fast forward to my mother asking me if I wanted to attend a Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) conference. I decided maybe I should. Maybe opening myself up to support, knowledge, and education wouldn’t be the worst idea in the world. It definitely beat the alternative to an all-day pajama commitment I had subconsciously made with myself. After my third conference, I received an email from LBBC letting women under the age of 45 know that they were training for young advocates in Philadelphia for a three-day training weekend. I held no reservation and filled out the application. In fact, I put a lot of hope into it. Due to the conferences I had attended, I started to feel the need to participate in spreading knowledge. KNOWLEDGE vs. AWARENESS… they are two very different concepts. Now all this time the tug-o-war continued. Even through the participation and education, I continued with “Am I dying or am I living with cancer?” After several weeks of waiting and one phone interview later, I received my acceptance email. I was beyond thrilled to say the very least. I knew when I received this acceptance it was something very important to my healing. I wasn’t sure how it would play out exactly, but I knew it would be therapeutic and healing for me. The day I was to leave, I found out an Internet support friend (who was an LBBC Young Advocate) named Sarah Merchant died that morning from metastatic breast cancer. Tug-o-war, please commence. I was so saddened by her passing that I was tempted not to go. I packed slowly–taking frequent breaks to lock myself in the bathroom to shed tears. I knew if I bailed on this opportunity I would regret it later. And so on the drive down, I spoke to Sarah and asked her to give me some sign I was doing the right thing and that this would indeed be purposeful and healing. When I arrived, I checked into my private room. I have to admit, I enjoyed the solitude and silence. I freshened up for dinner and the scheduled meet-and-greet and headed down to the lobby. I sat on the couch making small talk with the other brave women who were selected when I met a very stylish women who wore a fabulous dress. She introduced herself as Sara and she, too, was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. We hit it off from our first conversation! She, like me, was combining Western and eastern medicine to heal her body. We talked all through dinner. She was bold, smart, creative, and sensitive. I knew instantly that Sara was my sign from Sarah Merchant. She connected us through this crazy universe, and by doing that, she was letting me know she was okay and where she was supposed to be and I was exactly where I needed to be in life. I learned so much during that intense weekend. My brain was spilling over with knowledge. But most of all, I made the most intense bonds with some of the most courageous and awe-inspiring women. And slowly throughout the weekend, the tug-o-war ended. That weekend taught me many things, but the most important thing it taught me was that I found where I needed to be in this world. I am not living or dying from cancer, I am existing with cancer. I am thriving with cancer. And like everyone else who is born, I am going to eventually die, but until then, my place in this world is to be involved with the education of and support for any young woman who has heard that crashing sentence: “You have breast cancer.” So, the tug of war in my mind ended, and a gift was given to me. A gift of placement in this crazy beautiful world. The greatest gift I ever received.",0,1,0.16729717813051148
125,23,6,5,3,2016,2016-03-05,"This is the second of a two-part blog written by Living Beyond Breast Cancer supporter, Mark Plamondon. Mark’s story is one of many LBBC will be sharing with you in 2016 as we recognize 25 years of service to those impacted by breast cancer. Mark told the first part of his story earlier this week. Lee’s breast cancer was back. It had metastasized to her bones, liver and brain. We were faced with both the knowledge of how she would in all probability die and the statistics to determine how long we had left together. The luxury we had when first married and starting our family of measuring time in months and years had been replaced by increments of weeks and days. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to stop the voice in my head that kept asking “when.” Treatments began and ended. We had good days. We had bad days. We laughed and we cried. We felt connected. We sometimes felt alone. Remember, this was during the mid-90s. People whose lives were being changed by life-threatening illnesses didn’t have access to the many resources we have today. People had to create them or as in our case, find them through circumstance and luck. We learned about Living Beyond Breast Cancer from Lee’s radiation oncologist, Marisa Weiss. Marisa had started LBBC just a few years before for women to connect with each other to find information and to get support. “It’s strange. So much of that time is committed to memory for me, as clear as snapshots in an album. Yet, I can’t recall any one particular moment or conversation Lee and I had that cemented our commitment to Living Beyond Breast Cancer.” It’s strange. So much of that time is committed to memory for me, as clear as snapshots in an album. Yet, I can’t recall any one particular moment or conversation Lee and I had that cemented our commitment to Living Beyond Breast Cancer. If I had to guess, I’d say it just happened over a period of time. We came to depend on LBBC, for the support we received and equally important for the support we were able to give. As I mentioned earlier, Lee was a great communicator. There are lots of good communicators out there, people who make answers to questions about complex issues and concepts easier to understand. But there are far fewer who actually take the time to listen to the question first. That was Lee. So it’s easy to understand why she found herself drawn to an LBBC resource that continues to this day. In 1997 the Survivors’ Helpline launched nationally, but back then it was a local phone line. It was staffed, a few hours a week, by volunteer women diagnosed with breast cancer for women diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a place where callers could find someone else similar in age or stage of diagnosis. It gave women the chance to learn they weren’t alone and that what they were feeling was valid and real and important. That it was OK to talk about it. To communicate. As a volunteer, Lee found a purpose in helping others. It gave her the chance to use cancer instead of it using her. It helped her assign meaning to it. I supported her and the passion she had for the service because it was contagious. She advocated for it, pushed it, helped grow it. She remained passionately committed to it until the day she passed away. Less than a year after she was gone, I got a call from LBBC’s executive director Jean Sachs. A young man, who’d just lost his own wife to breast cancer, had called the Survivors’ Helpline. He was distraught, mourning a loss he was unable to accept or understand. I was asked to call him. I agreed. When I did, we began our conversation learning more about each other. He was younger than me. Not a huge difference but enough that we were at different places in our lives. He was without children and I had two young boys. Grief was an emotion we both were dealing with, but in very different ways. Yet we immediately felt a camaraderie. Regardless of our differences, we were connected by something that was both horrible and profound and it made me appreciate even more Lee’s passion to communicate with someone who shared an experience that had changed their lives in an unimaginable way. I’d been asked to make a call to help a stranger in need. But somehow, it was helping me. It felt RIGHT. My relationship with LBBC has only grown stronger since then. I served on the Board for 10 years. I’ve worked on numerous projects where my marketing experience was put to use, including expanding the Survivors’ Helpline and establishing it as a core LBBC program. It’s been amazing watching LBBC grow from a local organization helping those in the greater Philadelphia metro to a major player in the nonprofit arena, that helped over 500,000 people in need last year alone. The Survivors’ Helpline is now called the Breast Cancer Helpline. This toll-free service receives thousands of calls every year from people across the country and even offers the option to chat online if it’s preferred. People attend LBBC conferences from every state and even other countries. Yet the more things change, the more they remain the same. LBBC constantly exceeds expectations. Each and every member of the staff is an embodiment of the LBBC mission and their desire to connect those in need to trusted information and a community of support is a passion that spills over into everything they do. They are committed, they want to help and they are great at it. Before I sign off, I’d like to leave you with this. What I’ve shared with you just happens to be the way Lee and I attempted to cope with the hand we were dealt. It’s just one story, one to include with millions and millions of others. But it was our story and now it’s my story and for that reason I hold it close. Being diagnosed with breast cancer is tough. Caring for someone with breast cancer is tough. There isn’t a right way to deal with it or a wrong way. How a person copes can differ in ways really big and really small. It’s important that I recognize that you must find a way through it that works best for you and you do the same for me. I would never suggest there’s one way that’s better than another. But, I will say this. Talking about what’s happening in your life with someone is better than not talking. The Breast Cancer Helpline is staffed by people who can provide advice, and insight and hope. Callers aren’t only women with breast cancer. Diagnosed men have used the service, too. So have caregivers, friends, lovers and spouses. People just like you, who given the chance can share whatever is on their mind with someone who completely gets it. You don’t have to go through this alone. There are people who can help if you take the first step. Call the Breast Cancer Helpline. They helped Lee. They helped me. I’m confident they can help you, too. They may even be able to make things a little more RIGHT in your life. Exclamation point. The Breast Cancer Helpline is a service provided by LBBC. Helpline calls are answered live Monday – Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET. At all other times, just leave a message; calls are returned within 24 hours and often much sooner. Online chat is also available. Both are free and confidential.

In anticipation of our Twitter Chat on June 24, AnaOno Intimates Owner Dana Donofree blogs about her experience regaining confidence and embracing her desirability after treatment. I often compare myself to a broken doll. Not the kind that was so beloved, it was carried everywhere, slowly fading and falling into disrepair over time as if it were aging gracefully. More like the kind that was once beautiful, but its owner decided to take construction paper scissors and hack its hair down to oddly shaped tufts, to accidentally (or on purpose) break off a limb or two, scar the midsection with a Sharpie and leave it half bent and mutilated in in the corner of her closet. Because that’s what breast cancer did to me. It took a perfectly acceptable woman and turned her into a shadow of herself, and when it is all said and done, it made her feel broken, ruined and rejected. When I was first diagnosed, what was about to happen to my outward appearance wasn’t even on my mind. I thought I had it all together, the strength, the attitude, the “let’s do this.” See, I was never terribly attached to my breasts. I never even really thought about them all that much. I was 27. My boobs were small, but perky. They hadn’t done anything hero-worthy like nourish a child. Their biggest accomplishment was being able to exist without a bra. Their greatest time to shine was on weekend party nights when they could hang out in a super low-cut blouse and up my va va voom quotient. So, when the time came to go our very separate ways, my friends threw a “Ta-Ta to Dana’s Ta-Tas” party and they had one last night out on the town in the lowest plunging neckline I could find. I was pretty flippant and casual about parting with my two of my lady parts. Friends and family took bets on which of my surgeons, Dr. McDreamy and Dr. Hottie, was the better catch. I joked that they would be the last to ever cop a feel of my original breasts. I thought I was going to be just fine afterward. That it wouldn’t faze me in the least. But, I never could have prepared myself for what it felt like, both physically and mentally, when I woke from surgery. For something I felt I was completely comfortable with and ready for, losing them, my breasts, shook my world. I took off the bandages, and saw this alien staring back at me in the mirror. I was mutilated. I was swollen. My scars were their own entity purple and protruding like someone had chainsawed me up and stapled me back together. It is not at all what I had imagined. Where was this “We are replacing your boobs with ones just like them so you can feel ‘normal’?” I hadn’t expected to look like a badly-repaired Lego. I expected to kinda come out looking more implanty-boob-job like. This body was the farthest cry from normal I could have ever imagined. Continue reading →",0,1,0.18442460317460324

On October 30, 2008, my mom and dad sat me down on my bed to give me some news. I couldn’t imagine what they were going to say to me, but I knew it was serious. My mom had breast cancer. Cancer? What is that? I was pretty smart for a 9-year-old kid. I knew it had something to do with bad cells in your body and I knew that it was life threatening. I sat and listened. When they asked me if I had any question, I said nothing. I did not know what to say. So when they left my room, I sat there motionless and deep in thought. I went through my days as I usually did, which was going to school, playing basketball and doing my homework. Inside, I felt scared and angry. I did not know anyone whose mom had ever had breast cancer. After some time, I decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to help my family out in any way I could. I helped set up a schedule for our friends to prepare dinner for us while my mom was going through chemo. I also started speaking to my friends about it, but none of them went through the same thing I was going through. Continue reading →",0,-1,-0.047751322751322746

130,23,64,11,6,2015,2015-06-11,"Don S. Dizon, MD, FACP, regularly blogs on ASCO Connection, where this post originally appeared. Learn more about sex and intimacy after a breast cancer diagnosis during our Twitter Chat, Tweets from the Sheets, on June 24. As an oncologist who also runs a sexual health clinic for women treated (or under treatment), I am discovering that my perspective on both issues of cancer treatment (and survival) and life after cancer (and quality of life) is somewhat unique. I am conscious of how difficult it is to bring up cancer therapy and survivorship (let alone sexual health) within the same discussion, yet I have gained a heightened sensitivity of the importance of looking beyond treatment even while we are discussing what to do now. I have benefitted greatly from colleagues in the field of sexual health, such as Michael Krychman, at UC Irvine, and Anne Katz, in Canada, both of whom I have been privileged enough to count as colleagues, co-authors, and contemporaries. I am even more fortunate that one of my friends here in Boston also shares my interest in women’s health. Sandy Falk is a gynecologist and sees cancer survivors for women’s health issues at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In our practices, we both see the adverse effects of therapy that patients have to cope with. However, far from the arthralgias of aromatase inhibitors and neuropathy of some of our chemotherapeutic agents (two symptoms which we as oncologists are comfortable discussing), sexual health is often compromised. There are common complaints encountered by those of us who cover sexual health. They include: “I’m done with treatment, but now I can’t have sex. It is too painful and my sexual desire is completely gone.” “Why didn’t my oncologist warn me about this? Maybe if I had known my partner and I could have worked on this early on. But now, so much time has passed now and my partner and I have lost patience.” “I’m not sure how to go on with my relationship.” Those may be extreme examples, and I hope for most oncologists that they are. However, what I do know is that these perceptions do exist—inside and outside of medicine. When the paper on AI treatment was picked up by several sites, I had read some comments posted and was disheartened to see that some of the thoughts above were reflected: “A woman should be lucky to be alive,” one stated; another said, “You can’t have sex if you’re dead.” I believe most oncologists do not discuss sexual health with their patients and as an oncologist, I understand why. Most clinicians reading this might think (perhaps unconsciously) that the patient is “lucky to be alive.” And of course, she is. And we also know that she probably wouldn’t have had the ability to hear detailed information about sexual health during the diagnosis and treatment planning process—there were much bigger priorities then.

Download the audio recording and presentation from our June 4 ASCO webinar to learn about updates from the 2015 meeting. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has existed since 1964, and has held an annual conference for almost as long. ASCO created the Journal of Clinical Oncology, a publication in which many important breast cancer studies appear, and cancer breakthroughs are often announced at ASCO’s annual meeting. For years, representatives from Living Beyond Breast Cancer have attended this conference in order to hear about the latest in breast cancer research, and to pass that information on to you, to help you navigate life after a breast cancer diagnosis. As LBBC’s writer and content coordinator, I went to this year’s conference, which took place May 29 to June 2, in Chicago. It was my first time at the event and it was an exciting opportunity to join the more than 30,000 people from all over the world who were in attendance. Some, like me, were there as patient advocates, representing people with cancer. But the vast majority of people there were cancer doctors. They came to present their own research and to learn from their colleagues. Over the course of 5 days, thousands of studies, hundreds of which related to breast cancer, were presented; and dozens of educational sessions, in which doctors discussed what recent findings mean for their day-to-day practices, were held. Moving between sessions about surgery, different breast cancer types, quality of life and other topics required quick navigating of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America. I’m certain I walked a few miles as I zigzagged through the crowds! In situations where I couldn’t be in two equally-interesting sounding sessions at once, ASCO’s use of technology and social media were really helpful. Many sessions were filmed, and the Twitter hashtag #ASCO15 helped me see what aspects of the conference people were most excited about. Even though ASCO has been over for about a week, people are STILL using the hashtag to continue the conversation. (Check it out for yourself!) Continue reading →",0,1,0.17452601410934748

Life doesn’t stop because of a breast cancer diagnosis – it goes on. How you decide to approach that life is up to you. Me personally, I never missed a step. After deciding on a treatment plan and scheduling my surgery I was on my way to Virginia Beach with my daughter for the International Junior Miss. Some background information about this trip: My daughter Mikayla is my hero and one of the strongest, most driven individuals I know. I tease her all the time that I want to be just like her when I grow up. At the tender age of 9 she announced she wanted to be a microbiologist and will be attending U.C. Berkeley to earn her degree, and here is the kicker – she wants to pay for it herself! Since those words left her mouth, Mikayla, now 14, has made it her mission to do just that. Besides maintaining a A/B average in school, she competes in natural pageants to earn scholarships, pageants like International Junior Miss. As a pageant mom, I wear many hats: tailor, beautician, coach, travel agent and cheerleader to name a few. Needless to say, my cancer diagnosis was a huge hiccup in my role as her support system. Monetheless, I was determined to work around it. On our way back from an exhausting week of competitions, I received a phone call from my daughter’s new pageant director Christina Sacha Grooms, who introduced herself to us and updated us about the rest of my daughter’s reign. I informed her of my diagnosis and told her that no matter what I would get my daughter where she needed to be. While I was fighting the good fight in treatment, my daughter was reigning as International Junior Miss’ Colorado Preteen 2014. And as promised she was at every event, photo shoot, and appearance as scheduled. Our pageant family was just as supportive as our immediate family and to this day, I thank God for these incredible people. Every time we saw each other it was a family reunion and it touched my heart to know they read and looked forward to my Facebook posts. Every day I tried to share my feelings and thoughts with my family and friends. Continue reading →",0,1,0.13006198347107437

I shared just enough of the bad news with immediate family out of necessity and then retreated. I just wanted to be left alone and even deactivated my Facebook account. Beyond the initial shock I swiftly started to share again. I shared my story with the local newspaper. I shared with my friends. I shared my story on social media. I shared with colleagues. I shared with my 93-year-old grandmother who insisted on knowing what was going on. And I shared with my then fiancée. I didn’t just text or email. I picked up the phone and shared. I shared in person sometimes over coffee or an adult beverage. In retrospect I’m not certain as to why I shared so swiftly and vastly. I just know that I shared my story with almost everyone I encountered. What I was not prepared for the reactions I received or didn’t receive. This is one of the unspoken challenges of being a young woman diagnosed with cancer. No one expects that the news would come from someone so well, young. “No way, you’re so young, it doesn’t make sense,” a lot of friends would say. I’d shrug. Yeah, well. Oh well.

135,23,69,12,5,2015,2015-05-12,"Last week, our Facebook followers shared hundreds of tips for coping with hair loss. Blogger Judy Weinstein wrote this post about her personal experience with hair loss and how she handled the side effect. When you get a cold, you feel sick right away. Strep throat? It’s obvious something is wrong! Kidney stones? You are in the hospital crying in pain. Cancer is different. Cancer silently does its evil damage while you are going about your daily life. You are working, laughing, and likely “sweating the small stuff” while your cancer sneakily divides and tries to conquer. One day you wake up and realize that something isn’t quite right. You have a slightly unusual lump, a little blood where you shouldn’t, or unexplained pain. Then the bombshell is dropped. “You have cancer.” For many women who endure chemotherapy, one of our preoccupations is about becoming bald. I was squarely in that category. I generally don’t wear make-up and I don’t spend a long time pondering what to wear. I did, however, spend a lot of energy over my lifetime thinking about my hair. I will always remember the very first time I cut my long hair up to my chin. I was in 6th grade. One of my parent’s best friends said “Today we lost our little girl.” I puffed with pride that a shorter haircut could make me look all grown up. Soon after, I grew it out and curled the front in a desperate attempt to look like Farrah Faucet. Then later came the big hair stage… even with a perm my straight hair didn’t cooperate! After my third baby was born, my hair began to change. I started to become gray and over time my hair became more wavy, frizzy and unruly. And did I mention gray? Those wiry gray strands were the worst! Figuring out a style that was best became a monthly challenge. What was the right color for my changing hair? This time it was too blonde…this time too red. Should I go short? Long? Bangs? No bangs? One style was good for the winter and another for the summer humidity. One style worked for pulling it back when I played tennis but wasn’t flattering at other times! My patient hairdresser, now a close family friend, made whatever changes I asked for, knowing that I would always second guess my hair decision. Once I had a cancer diagnosis and knew I was facing hair loss, thinking about becoming bald was admittedly terrifying. How humiliating to lose what I thought played such a heavy role in defining my looks and by extension, who I am. My cousin told me about the penguin caps one can wear during chemotherapy that works to prevent hair loss. Suddenly my emotions began to shift. The only thing I could think of worse than losing my hair, was to sit for several hours, being infused with toxic chemicals, wearing an ice-pack on my head. I was NOT willing to do that to prevent hair loss. So maybe, just maybe if I wasn’t willing to go to such great lengths to prevent hair loss, perhaps it wasn’t as important as I initially thought. I began losing my hair on January 1. While I had the rest of my uncomfortable treatment ahead of me, I also had the hope and wonder that comes with any new beginnings. What would this year bring? Finishing treatment, my middle son graduating from high school and starting collage, my youngest son starting high school and thanks to this treatment, celebrating my half century birthday! Never before did I deeply appreciate the thought of reaching this milestone. As my grandmother used to say “It’s better than the alternative!” Continue reading →",0,1,0.011171138910109499
136,23,7,3,3,2016,2016-03-03,"We’re launching a three-part Q&A series beginning today, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, featuring blog contributor Natalie Gamble. Learn more about TNBC during our live Web stream, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer 360: Waiting for the Future, taking place today, March 3 at 6 p.m. ET. Living with triple-negative breast cancer sometimes feels like you’re walking on a tight rope. That’s at least how Natalie Gamble, 44, of Denver, Colorado describes her initial feelings after she finished chemotherapy. Unlike estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive disease, no targeted therapies exist for TNBC. Although chemotherapy has been shown to be the most effective treatment, people like Natalie sometimes feel overwhelmed dealing with the uncertainty and the lack of access to a targeted therapy. “Once I finished chemotherapy, I felt like I was left to deal with these feelings by myself,” Natalie says. “Feelings you don’t necessarily have unless you have triple-negative breast cancer.” In this Q&A with Digital Media Specialist Josh Fernandez, Natalie discusses fear of recurrence, support for TNBC and more. Josh: Fear of recurrence is a significant concern for people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. How do you manage these fears in your day-to-day life? Natalie: Writing has been a big help. I write a lot – poetry, blog posts, short stories – to try to get my mind off this diagnosis. Meditation has also been a huge help. It keeps me calm and in a positive frame of mind. I’m about to participate in a study through the Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers called “Valued Living for Survivors”. It’s a study where, with a group, you learn how to manage your feelings after completing treatment. I heard about it and thought dealing with this stress in a group forum would help. Josh: Could you share with our readers some tips on how they can get support for TNBC? Natalie: Different approaches work for different people. The Internet was really helpful to me, but you have to be careful – not all information is created equally. The information and stories I found on social media and the Web were sometimes very disheartening and scary. When I was doing research and Googling, websites like LBBC.ORG and MyBCTeam were so helpful. MyBCTeam, which is like a breast cancer social media, let’s you tell your story to others affected by breast cancer. When I’m having a really bad day, I hop on and ask question, look for input from my peers or just vent about my day in an update. Another activity that’s been helpful for me is therapeutic gardening with a bonsai tree. Denver Botanic Gardens and Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers offer a program for people with cancer, where you use sheers and gardening techniques to care for the tree and almost illustrate your cancer journey as you trim and shape the tree. At the end of the program, you get to take your tree home. And you’re with others who’ve experienced cancer, so you’re not alone. Josh: On TNBC Awareness Day what are one or two important takeaways for readers to know about triple-negative breast cancer? Natalie: It’s not a death sentence. Someone living with this diagnosis is always going to have in the back of her mind that the cancer might come back one day. I have that thought from time-to-time. If you’ve just finished treatment or are years beyond, try to reflect on how far you’ve come. Hold on to good memories, anything that can help you believe you can overcome the fear. It’s not over just because there’s no targeted therapy. You can get through treatment, get through the fear. You can do it.

137,23,70,11,5,2015,2015-05-11,"This blog post by Liz Barker originally appeared on ChangedbyChance.com on April 28, 2015. It was reprinted here with the author’s permission. I volunteer at numerous Living Beyond Breast Cancer events through the year. Spring brings an all-day yoga event called Namaste`Day to Philadelphia. LBBC is an advocate of yoga because of its mind, body, and spirit connective healing philosophy. They appreciate that healing a life threatening illness such as breast cancer needs to be addressed with all of the body’s senses. And so, they had a booth at Namas Day and I volunteered because I love yoga. Typically, there are at least 2 of us survivors at an LBBC event and it is always nice to meet someone new and to hear their BC story. Well, this encounter turned out to be extraordinary! (Of course, it should have been no surprise given the spiritual nature of Namas Day.) So, my fellow volunteer that day is Elizabeth Howanski. As usual, we swap our Breast Cancer stories. As usual, I expect that when I tell my new friend that I am a 24 year, young survivor, she will be wowed by the survivor-ship years. Which I am grateful for every day folks. However, much to my surprise, Betsy tells me that she is a longer survivor! Although we are both the same age (58), Betsy was diagnosed younger, at age 26. Therefore, she is now a 32 year survivor! Neither of us has a family history of BC. Our name and age similarities don’t end there. Betsy was also diagnosed while she was pregnant, at about 5 months along with same timing – diagnosed in May and due date was early October! We were both given the same trite, horrifying advice by our doctors – “terminate your pregnancy to save your life.” Sadly, our parallels end here. Betsy followed her doctor’s advice and reluctantly terminated her pregnancy. (Remember, there was no Internet and not much history of BC at young ages or during pregnancy back then. Without question, doctor knew best.) I almost followed that advice but, I was fortunate that a family friend, a doctor himself, (an angel I call him), intervened and saved my baby’s life. Betsy and I wept and hugged as we shared our stories. I felt a bit guilty and humbled, that I was touched by an angel and that Bryan was saved. More importantly though, I felt a kindred spirit with Betsy, not only due to our similar past, but also because of our futures and our philosophies of “living beyond breast cancer.” Betsy bravely moved on with an enthusiastic and positive spin on life. She adopted 3 wonderful children from Korea who are now 21, 29, and 31. She is a long time professional working at Drexel University’s development office. We both echoed the same sentiments about our lives – that the BC experience was a life lesson. It taught us both some sage advice. That we need to be self-advocates and to educate ourselves when we are faced with serious obstacles in our lives. It’s the 3 R’s that I talk about in my book – Recognize, Research, and then React. Live and learn. Another day, another journey… Namaste~ Liz Barker is a longtime LBBC volunteer.

138,23,71,6,5,2015,2015-05-06,"Welcome! We are excited to share our theme for Yoga on the Steps 2015: Your Love Story. When we say “Your Love Story” we’re not talking about romantic love, nor are we talking about love for family, or friends, which is all valuable and essential. When we say “Your Love Story” we’re talking about a theme for the Yoga on the Steps practice which features you at the center of your own love story, honoring your own experiences and journey. Because ultimately, self-acceptance, self-care and self-respect is the love story a yoga practice promotes. What is your love story? All love stories begin with something happening or not happening to you. Your expectations and world changes and your perception of “Who you are” is challenged. There are 3 basic elements to process change: Choose a lens to view your experience. You have a choice. Do you choose to feel victimized? To fall into the trap of ‘worst case scenario’ thinking? Or will you choose to be the heroine of your destiny? Choose the lens, the perspective of yourself that empowers you. Advocate for your self-care and investigate what draws you fully alive. Will you reach out into your community for support and education? Will you love yourself enough to make yourself a priority and advocate for your personal care and joy? Choose your joy and respect your own process. Simplify and love. Clean house, unclutter, and eliminate what crowds or blocks you from doing what you love. Simplify and distill your life down to what really matters to you. Instead of talking about it, do what you love. Love is a verb, an action. You love baking, love dancing, love being with friends, love the outdoors, etc. Get engaged to what you love. Do what you love. We invite you to come to Yoga on the Steps with the intention to empower Your Love Story in new and exciting ways. We look forward to seeing you on the steps! ~ Jennifer Schelter & Yvette Pecoraro Jennifer Schelter, MFA, is the founder of Yoga Schelter, Inc., and co-founder of our signature fundraising event, Yoga on the Steps.

139,23,72,5,5,2015,2015-05-05,"Written by Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer When you hear DeAnna Chenoweth lives in Miami, it’s reasonable to think she could find excellent cancer care at the large hospitals or centers near her home. That’s understandable to assume until you learn she lives in Miami, Oklahoma – not Miami, Florida. Living in a small town or rural area can make finding breast cancer care challenging. There was a cancer center about 45 minutes away from DeAnna. “That was where most people went for treatment,” she says. At the time of her breast cancer diagnosis, however, the center and its hospital, in Joplin, Missouri, were shut down from severe tornado damage. DeAnna, a sonographer at a small local hospital, was determined to locate breast cancer specialists – experts more often found in larger hospitals and cancer centers. In her small town, DeAnna felt “everybody’s treated with the same recipe,” she says. She wanted to be sure her doctors would give a young woman the appropriate treatment, knew the latest research and would talk with her about it. It was important to her to find a team of providers she could trust and develop a relationship with throughout her experience. She also wanted access to all treatment options. Long-distance treatment DeAnna began searching for care. Diagnosed at age 41 with stage IIB hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive disease, she first saw a breast surgeon 90 miles away, in Tulsa. She left that office feeling displeased with the uncaring attitude she encountered. “I didn’t like the way they treated me or the other patients being seen that day,” she says. The other surgeon she could see was not in her health insurance network, so hercosts for care would be much higher. A Tulsa cancer center also was not covered, her insurance company told her, but a related location near Chicago, about 600 miles away, was in-network. She decided to make the trips to Chicago for treatment because she couldn’t afford out-of-network costs at the closer facility. So, instead of driving 90 miles for care, DeAnna drove 90 miles, then got on an airplane and flew for every treatment or procedure. The center in Chicago covered her flights because she could not get in-network coverage at their Tulsa hospital. Flying to another city for care saved her money over out-of-network costs. “It’s crazy, but it’s the game you have to play,” she says. “When you’re talking about these hospital bills, that difference of even 10 percent makes a huge difference.” As a Native American of Cherokee descent, DeAnna also received help with co-pays from the Indian Health Service (IHS). She now picks up most of her ongoing medicines, with no co-pays, directly from a nearby IHS facility. Traveling for treatment was rigorous. Since her 20-year marriage ended shortly before her diagnosis, DeAnna was a single parent, raising a 12-year-old and 16-year-old twins, plus had a full-time job. “I felt like the ringmaster,” she says. “I asked myself, how do I keep all these things going?” Creating support Some of DeAnna’s co-workers donated vacation or sick days to supplement hers. A large bake sale and Zumbathon event raised funds for her expenses. Now 44, DeAnna thinks the number of affected young women living near her is unusual. She joined a breast cancer support group for young women when a friend of hers set it up. Her friend works in a Joplin mammography center. After 6 months, the group had about 40 members. They meet online and in person. “I think I’m the oldest,” DeAnna says. One other woman is single. Most work, a few are at home with children. Members have varying diagnoses and are at different points in their care. DeAnna recalls helping one 32-year-old woman who was about to have a mastectomy. “I showed her my drains and let her touch them. I said, “This is what you’re getting ready to do. Don’t be afraid.’” When a member posted online about having her final chemotherapy session that day, another member dropped in and sat with her. The group holds evening and daytime meet-ups, to let people attend when they can. They’re planning a weekend “slumber party” getaway to Branson,Missouri. Having the group, says DeAnna, “is nice, because in my situation, I didn’t want to burden the kids.” She appreciates knowing other women affected by breast cancer who share her viewpoint and help each other. “Some ladies will say, ‘My husband just doesn’t understand.’ And we say, ‘You don’t have to be all fuzzy and cupcakes here.’” This article was supported by the Grant or Cooperative Agreement Number 1 U58 DP005403, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

140,23,73,1,5,2015,2015-05-01,"Sometimes your doctor may recommend a clinical trial, a new approach that is being compared to standard treatment to see which is more effective. New LBBC Blogger Judy Weinstein writes about weighing the pros and cons of a trial she joined, ISPY2. When I think back to the weeks following my breast cancer diagnosis, I picture myself in the middle of a tornado moving along at a frightening speed. One day I was pondering what to pack for my upcoming 25th wedding anniversary trip to Italy and the next I was in a swirl of medical appointment mania. I had to choose a hospital, an oncologist, and a surgeon, endure a slew of medical tests, take it all in emotionally and then break the news to close friends and family. Along the way, as all newly diagnosed cancer patients do, I took a crash course in understanding breast cancer and my particular type so I could make informed choices about my treatment. Just the vocabulary alone was enough to make my head spin! Words like triple-positive, HER2-positive, and neoadjuvant therapy were thrown around and I needed to understand it all. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, another new word was put in front of me that I needed to learn: ISPY2. No, this was not the fun game you play in the car when you are bored and you say, “I spy with my little eye something blue,” and the other person has to guess what you are seeing. ISPY2 was a Phase II medical trial that, because of the exact nature of my cancer, I was eligible to be a participant. Questions came flooding in. Aren’t trials for people who are dying and have no other options? I know that trials are important to advance research but do I want my body to be the guinea pig? How could I live with myself if I found out the experimental medicine I was on actually doesn’t work, or has long term side effects that the doctors didn’t find out about until years later? Facing chemotherapy was scary enough. Did I want to be a part of a trial that had so many unknowns attached? I learned that the goal of the trial is to pinpoint how each individual tumor grows and target treatment to a specific tumor type. Today, most women affected by breast cancer receive standard chemotherapy. Some breast cancers respond to this treatment. Others do not. This study screens promising new targeted medicines that could increase success rates while reducing side effects. After much reading, talking to my doctors and to LBBC, and pondering it deeply with those closest to me, I decided to take the plunge…. well, only halfway. I found out that I could be screened for the trial, told which drug I would be getting, and THEN decide if I wanted to continue. At any point in the trial I could opt out.

141,23,74,29,4,2015,2015-04-29,"Written by Erin, Rowley, Writer and Content Coordinator As a former pastor in a church whose members were largely gay and lesbian, Patricia Voelker has counseled couples who have faced discrimination in different areas of life, including health care. Her advice to at least one couple: “Get a new doctor.” In 2013, Patricia, a now 74-year-old Lexington, South Carolina resident, had to deal with two breast cancer diagnoses – hers, and her daughter’s, who was diagnosed a few months before Patricia. In the past, Patricia has encountered healthcare professionals who were insensitive to, or ill-informed about the gay community. But as a lesbian woman in treatment for breast cancer, she says she hasn’t experienced discrimination from her cancer care team. Any problems she’s had with them have been strictly medical. Patricia only came out to herself as a lesbian at age 39. Though she is open about her sexuality, (“I know who I am and I’m fine with who I am,” she says), it’s not something she declares when meeting a new doctor. It didn’t really come up while talking with her cancer care team. This is due, in part, to her single relationship status: She didn’t have to explain a same-sex partner at appointments. Her therapist knows about her sexual orientation, as does her nurse practitioner, who Patricia has been going to for years. Her advice for other LGBT people with breast cancer is the same advice she’d give to straight people with breast cancer: Make sure you have doctors you trust, because ultimately, you have to be your own best advocate. “Make sure you’ve got a good relationship with [healthcare professionals],” she said. “If you don’t, don’t feel bad about asking for another opinion or for changing to somebody else.” Patricia says that being open and willing to talk about her sexuality is what feels right to her, but she knows that can come with risks for some people. “I can’t guarantee you that you won’t lose a job, or you won’t lose a friend, or you won’t lose a family member,” she said. “All I can say is I’m out and it works for me.” Patricia doesn’t have any plans to start dating, but she says breast cancer shouldn’t stop others from doing so. Neither she nor her daughter, nor anybody else, Patricia says, did anything to bring the cancer on themselves, so there should be no sense of shame associated with the disease. “[Cancer] might bother somebody else enough that they would not want to be involved with you, but that would be their problem,” she says. Today, she and her daughter are both doing well. After having a lumpectomy followed by radiation, Patricia sees her nurse practitioner every 3 months and is on daily hormonal therapy to treat the hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. She says she wanted to share her story to show what a wide spectrum of people there are in the breast cancer community – and even in the smaller, LGBT breast cancer community.",0,1,0.1482003710575139
142,23,75,23,4,2015,2015-04-23,"Written By Robin Warshaw, Contributing Writer After finishing her family medicine residency at age 29, Breck McCarty felt “as if I had been going to school forever.” That was about to change, as she and her husband-to-be prepared for the next step in their careers: moving from South Dakota to join a medical practice in a small Wyoming town. When she felt a breast lump, Breck let it go for a few weeks. “It persisted, so I saw a surgeon who was one of our preceptors [teachers] in our training and requested that I get a biopsy.” He told her she was young and he didn’t think it was cancer, but would biopsy it anyway. “He came to my house to deliver the news,” Breck says. The new doctor was diagnosed with stage IIA breast cancer. She had a mastectomy just days before moving to Wyoming. Pregnancy planning At first, she didn’t think about how treatment might affect her fertility. Then a friend, also a family doctor, asked her about it. “I would not have even thought of it if she hadn’t mentioned it,” Breck says. “I was so overwhelmed.” She had no children and wanted them in the future. She learned it was important to have fertility preservation, storing embryos or eggs before chemotherapy, to avoid damage. Fertile Hope, now LIVESTRONG Fertility Services, helped Breck get discounted rates for fertility preservation services. She had eggs taken, then embryos created from them and the resulting embryos frozen. After initial breast cancer treatment, Breck received tamoxifen because her disease was hormone receptor-positive. Tamoxifen cannot be taken while pregnant. She worried whether taking it for 5 years ( 10 years is now recommended) might be too long to wait for pregnancy. She looked for research, joined online groups and talked with other women about her concerns. “My oncologist was very science- and data-oriented and he did not have scientific information or adequate data to help me,” she says. After almost 3 years of tamoxifen, she decided to stop and try to get pregnant. She had to wait 3 months for the medicine to leave her body before starting the embryo implantation process. She became pregnant with twins, lost one, but the other did well. Jacob was born in April 2011. “I chose not to breastfeed and went back on tamoxifen the night I had him,” says Breck. Second diagnosis The family moved again, to a larger town and new practice. In 2013, Breck felt a painful nodule on her mastectomy side. “I really wasn’t that concerned, other than it was new.” She promptly went to a radiologist, who advised a CT scan. Later that day, he showed her and her husband worrisome areas on her liver. A biopsy confirmed she had a metastasis: that the breast cancer had spread to her liver. “Being a doctor and knowing the statistics, I thought this was about the worst news I could receive. I didn’t anticipate ever getting my life back after that,” she says. She was referred to an oncologist in another city who specializes in young women. They met a week later, which helped. “I left her office thinking I would get some semblance of my life back. Having her tell me she has many women living many years with metastatic breast cancer, knowing she was actively seeing women who had lived several years, gave me some hope,” recalls Breck. She went back on chemotherapy, which shrunk some of the liver tumors, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) for HER2-positive disease. Later, she was switched to a new anti-HER2 medicine, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), when it received FDA approval. Her uterus and ovaries were surgically removed and she began taking an aromatase inhibitor. Breck says she found more support after her metastatic diagnosis than the first time. After recurrence, she met another young woman affected by breast cancer and they became close friends. There are no local support groups, but she reaches out to area young women who are diagnosed. “As a physician, my experience is widely known in the community. All my patients are aware – I never hid anything that was going on,” she says. “Some people come to me because of it.” Breck has also found – and given – help through Casting for Recovery, other organizations and an international Facebook group for women with metastatic breast cancer. “I try to be there for support and encouraging words,” she says.

143,23,76,22,4,2015,2015-04-22,"Written By Erin Rowley, Writer and Content Coordinator Graduation is a proud time in a woman’s life. But for Sherry Lawson it was also a stressful time. In 1996, two weeks before she was set to graduate with a Master of Social Work degree, she found a lump on her right breast. The day after the ceremony, she had a mammogram done. That led to a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, cancer that travels to another part of the body – in this case, her bones. Cancer was found in her ribs as well as her breast. The timing couldn’t have been worse. Sherry had just graduated; her partner had just started a new business. The couple had a 2-year-old son and was thinking of having another child. Sherry’s stress was increased by the fact that, as an out lesbian woman in a long-term relationship, she sometimes felt alienated by healthcare providers. “We had to out ourselves each visit. It’s uncomfortable and it sets you apart,” she said. Over the almost two decades that she’s had breast cancer, Sherry, now 59, has been thrilled to see her fellow Americans become more accepting of gay and lesbian people — the cultural landscape, she says, was much less friendly 20 years ago. But for Sherry, staying in the closet wasn’t an option. This was partly because she had decided shortly before her diagnosis that she wasn’t going to hide her sexuality from anybody, but also because her partner came to her appointments to support her. Though she doesn’t have any “horror stories,” she says healthcare providers often wouldn’t acknowledge her partner, directing all information at her instead. Sherry would sometimes see them acting warmly toward others, only to notice their tone change when they talked to Sherry. Sometimes, she says, she felt like she was no longer “Ms. Lawson in room 204,” but “the gay woman in room 204.” She also felt different and separated from other women with breast cancer — if there were other lesbians in the support groups she attended, they weren’t out about it. “Yes, we had breast cancer and yes, we were females, but it would have been so much nicer for me if I could have connected with a lesbian who was going through breast cancer as well,” she says. The stress of maintaining a relationship while dealing with cancer is experienced by straight and gay couples alike. It strained the relationship between Sherry and her partner. The pair eventually split up, but the support that her partner provided while Sherry was going through treatment still means the world to her. Sherry says both the person who has cancer and his or her partner face many difficulties, which can lead to ugly behavior. It’s important for both people to be understanding of what the other person is going through. She says partners of people who have breast cancer do the tough job of having to constantly be supportive, while receiving little support themselves for what they’re going through. She’s not sure she could do it if she was in the other person’s shoes. Sherry had a quadruple heart bypass in 2009 and was diagnosed with a new breast cancer in 2011. That, along with lymphedema, swelling that develops in tissues under the skin of the hand, arm, breast or torso as a result of some breast cancer treatment, slowed her down and led her to retire in 2013. Despite the many challenges she’s faced, Sherry says dealing with breast cancer has made her a stronger person. It’s taught her the importance of forgiveness, loving herself and using what she’s learned to help others. She’s also learned to ask for, and accept, help from others, and she’s realized just how many people in her life care about her. Her answer when asked if she’s thriving, in spite of cancer? “You better believe it.”",0,1,0.16072214822214823

Digital Media Specialist Josh Fernandez interviewed Caryn about her interest in LBBC, what she loves most about volunteering and why she thinks others should volunteer. Josh: You’re a longtime volunteer for LBBC. Why do you choose to donate your time to us? Caryn: When I was first diagnosed 17 years ago, I used to crawl into my bedroom after chemotherapy and go online to look for any type of information that could help. I stumbled upon LBBC. The resources, even back in their infancy, were the best I had found. I knew it was a trusted source of information, and I knew this was the organization for me. I started attending community meetings first and then I just felt a connection to the organization and the people who work there. I knew the fit was there. I knew it very the very beginning. Their arms were always outstretched and they always had an answer to the questions I had. Volunteering seemed like the least I could do. Josh: What are some of your favorite activities to do as an LBBC volunteer? Caryn: I do many activities for LBBC. Each one has its own special meaning to me. I enjoy coming into the office and helping during office hours. I enjoy attending events and representing LBBC in speaking engagements at places like Fox Chase Cancer Center. I spoke for the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) for a few years. I love doing the Breast Cancer Helpline. I love being an empathetic listener for the callers and giving them resources. Some need to really get ‘it’ out of their system. Others just need resources and a place to turn. I just did the Hear My Voice : Metastatic Breast Cancer Outreach Volunteer Program, which is going to be a great program – it’s already in action as we speak. It’s a wonderful way to spread the word about the need for research and creating more public awareness of what metastatic breast cancer means. I like any type of advocacy work I can do, especially if it’s for LBBC. Continue reading →",0,1,0.3169312169312169

We’ll be posting lots more about the conference in the coming days, but here’s a quick look at some of our participants during the event. LBBC’s Hear My Voice volunteers organized a group to depict the need for greater awareness of what metastatic breast cancer really means and to gain insight and support from those around them.

Learn more about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk during our April 26 community meeting. My cancer “journey” began last June on a gorgeous spring day after my daughter’s confirmation at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel. I left my daughter’s confirmation service that morning filled with tears of joy and happiness; I didn’t realize that in a few hours, there would be different tears coming my way. That afternoon, I had a mammogram and breast ultrasound appointment. A few weeks earlier, I felt a small lump in the shower and wanted to make sure all was OK. As a busy mom, I honestly didn’t know the last time I had done a self-exam. I have since learned that most women find their breast cancer, not doctors. Early detection made my “journey” a little easier and according to my doctor, saved my life. With dense breasts, the results of my mammogram turned out to be negative, but the ultrasound showed a mass in my right breast. A week later, the biopsy confirmed that I had stage I breast cancer. When I heard the words “cancer,” my whole world turned upside down. I was supposed to plan my son’s upcoming Bar Mitzvah, not have cancer. I called my rabbi and asked how to handle cancer and still be “mom.” She said “let your kids know that your job is to still take care of them, that doesn’t change with having cancer.” The next day, I received a phone call from my primary doctor who was shocked to hear of my cancer diagnosis. He has known me since I was a teenager and knows I try my best to live a healthy lifestyle. I am a vegetarian, exercise every day and don’t smoke. After learning I had breast cancer, my doctor thought maybe I carried a BRCA gene and told me to get tested. If I was a carrier, my daughter, son, brother and nephew would have a risk of developing breast cancer, too. My heart sank hearing about this. I was already concerned about my family’s emotional health, and now I was worried about their physical health, too. Continue reading →",0,1,0.18472531436817152

Throughout the year, we’ll be featuring not only the stories of the women and men who have turned to LBBC for help, but also the stories of individuals whose commitment to the work we do have made an indelible impact on furthering our mission of connecting people to trusted information and a community of support. Mark Plamondon is one of those people. You know that feeling you get when things in your life are RIGHT? Not the kind of right when you answer a question correctly or still make it to work on time even though traffic was horrible. I’m talking about the kind of right when life is RIGHT. All caps. Maybe an exclamation point, too, for emphasis. If you’re like me, you’ve probably come to find out that the times RIGHT happens are few and far between. But they do happen. For me, one of them was my wife, Lee. When I was with Lee, things were RIGHT. Exclamation point. We met while working at the same advertising agency, where we were introduced to each other through a mutual friend. Lee was fun and smart, had a great laugh and was a fantastic communicator. “Lee was fun and smart, had a great laugh and was a fantastic communicator.” She could talk to anyone about anything all while making them feel like they were the only person in the room with her. It made her great at what she did professionally. More importantly, it made her great to be around personally. People gravitated to her, myself included. Amazingly, the courage needed to ask her out on a date returned later when I asked her to marry me. Lucky for me she said “yes.” Both times. And off we went. In 1994, Lee was nursing our second son when she noticed something that made her uneasy. A visit to her doctor led to a series of tests which led to the news she had breast cancer. My 34-year-old wife, the mother of my two young boys, had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. We were told Lee’s best option, at the time, was chemotherapy. So that’s what we did. We hoped for the best, of course. She was young and healthy but for the breast cancer. Which tests indicated was early-stage. So, you can imagine our shock two years later when it was discovered that the cancer in Lee’s breast had metastasized. To her bones. And liver. And brain. My 36-year-old wife, the mother of my two young boys, had been diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. Earlier, I shared with you that Lee was a communicator. What made her so amazing at it professionally (her marketing jobs) and personally (everything else) was an understanding of its power. She was amazed, even dumbfounded at the lack of anything she found to be of value to help her make sense of her diagnosis and what she could expect. And then she found Living Beyond Breast Cancer. Be sure to to read the second part of Mark’s blog to learn how Lee used the power of communicating to help establish a core LBBC program and inspire Mark to use his experience to help LBBC grow in ways neither of them expected.

Marisa reflects on how this journey led her to Living Beyond Breast Cancer and Yoga on the Steps. After my shocking diagnosis in April 2014, I immediately went into survival mode. I hyper-fixated on getting through the current phase of treatment and onto the next phase. It was a whirlwind of getting a port, quickly followed by starting chemo, managing chemo side effects, finishing chemo, then on to a 9-hour surgery comprised of a double mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and free flap breast reconstruction. Soon, I was home recovering from this massive surgery and then stumbling into radiation daily for 5 weeks. Then, I woke up one morning in January and suddenly realized that active treatment was all over. Now what? In this frightening journey, I was missing a sense of community of others with similar experiences, both past and present. The endless support from my husband, family, and friends, did not fill the entire void. I heard about Living Beyond Breast Cancer right after my diagnosis. When I happened to be looking for local office space, my tour of commercial real estate ironically took me right through LBBC headquarters, which I toured. The office was warm and full of young, vibrant people. I wasn’t ready at that moment to reach out. I was reintroduced to LBBC in December, when I tried frantically to interpret the results of the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT). This major trial will likely change the standard of care for me and other women under age 35 with ER-positive breast cancer, by recommending induction of early menopause (as if we haven’t been through enough) and possibly switching from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor.

When PBS’s three-part documentary based on Siddhartha Mukherjee’s The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer debuts tonight, the public will get to know cancer as a shadowy and deviously brilliant historical figure that has been killing and maiming men, women, and children since the beginning of recorded history. Understanding and finding cures for cancer has obsessed generations of healers, scientists, fund-raisers, politicians, and entrepreneurs. As a patient advocate and someone who has watched cancer steal and forever change the lives of family and friends, I hope the film will help redirect some of today’s damaging conversations about, for example, which cancers are “better” to have and whether people with cancer ought to share the graphic details of their experiences publicly. Such conversations distract us from where we should be focused: on promoting research while showing compassion for all people going through treatment and its short- and long-term consequences. While other diseases, such as typhoid and tuberculosis, have been controlled or cured by hygiene and sanitation, Mukherjee notes that cancer has been elusive because its processes are locked in our genes and in the complex interplay of genes and their environment. Progress, while very real, has been relatively slow and uneven. As we now know, cancer can’t be cured in one fell swoop. Cancer is personal. Continue reading →",0,1,0.03588235294117646
150,23,82,23,3,2015,2015-03-23,"New LBBC blogger Joanne Hampton posts tips for offering the best possible peer support for people newly diagnosed with breast cancer. My journey has consisted of nine surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, and a positive diagnosis of BRCA1. I am an 11 year survivor. I have spoken at numerous events, sat on different committees, ran many successful fundraisers, and yet, I still feel awkward talking to someone who is newly diagnosed. They look up at me like I am about to reveal some great secret advice to get them through this. Tears begin to form in their eyes they ask me questions like “What now?” Even though I, too, am a breast cancer survivor and have traveled a similar path, I don’t always know what to say. Because of this I was inspired to do some research for myself and other breast cancer survivors who want to offer that glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel for someone recently diagnosed. I want to focus on some tips to think about when you are asked to speak to someone who is diagnosed with cancer. So that you can make it easier by giving them strength, make a difference by inspiring, and help by holding a hand. Tip #1: Each person’s reaction is different. This is very important. I can’t stress this enough. The most miniscule thing to one could be earth shattering to another. To me, losing my hair was the least of my worries. But, I have met a lot of women who were devastated and felt they had lost their dignity along with their hair. A person can’t always help or control how they feel. There’s no rhyme or reason, there’s no right or wrong but, they are real feelings and people will react differently, based on those feelings. Not all wounds are so obvious. Walk gently in her life. Tip #2: It is not all about you and your journey or the journeys of others. Be sensitive to her journey. Make sure you do not compare. Try and avoid saying things such as, “I know how you feel,” or “I know how hard it can be”. She needs to be herself and take her own journey. The secret is changing saying “I know” to “I understand”… because to an extent you do. As for comparing, most of the time people don’t even know they’re doing it. We don’t want her to feel bad if she isn’t living up to the expectation she sets for herself based on your experience. Continue reading →",0,1,0.11477945477945473

Meet Dr. Dizon at our Ninth Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer in Philadelphia, PA. Mom. Dad. Happy. Sad. Friend. Trust. I remember playing this game. A friend would say one thing, and then I would say the first thing that came to my mind. For some reason, it would pass the time. I remember how some words would spark an emotion or a memory. Sometimes happy, sometimes not so happy. But, playing that game was one of the first ways I learned the power of words. I started thinking about this one day when a group of colleagues were discussing palliative care. Despite how we all believed in the benefits of palliative care, we each recalled experiences where the mere mention of those words to a patient caused them to become defensive, even angry. “I remember taking care of an older woman,” someone had said. “She was on her fourth line of treatment for metastatic breast cancer, and her scan had showed some progression. She had been having issues with pain as well, and we had to adjust her medications several times in the past month. I mentioned that she would benefit from palliative care, and I was surprised about how upset this made her. She accused me of giving up on her, telling her she was dying. It was really upsetting.” Hearing that story made me more convinced that the associations of palliative care have not evolved, even as the evidence that palliative care benefits patients far before they are deemed terminal has accumulated. It made me think, perhaps the way to increase utilization of this service is to sever the “palliative care means hospice” connection. Yet, how to do that? Continue reading →",0,1,0.08958333333333335

Register now for this program and discover more about how you can help young women learn about fertility after breast cancer. Providing care to young cancer patients who wish to pursue fertility preservation prior to initiating cancer treatment requires the collaborative efforts of oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists, nurses and many more within a short time frame. Being able to effectively communicate and educate patients about the potential gonadotoxicity of cancer therapy, or damage to reproductive organs caused by treatment, and the available options for fertility preservation is essential to improve patient care. Many of the treatments we use to treat cancer for adolescent and young adult (AYA) women can decrease the likelihood of having biological children. High dose alkylating agents and pelvic radiation can destroy the ovarian reserve; radiation to the brain can harm the way the brain communicates to the gonads and surgical resection of reproductive organs can all make family building more difficult for patients.

Learn about our Ninth Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer, taking place April 11-12, 2015 in Philadelphia. Motivating, exciting, empowering, community building, love, strength, laughter and unity – these are the words that describe how I felt during and after I attended my first Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer. For me, this conference was a game changer on how I viewed my diagnosis. The event gave me a new hope and a new beginning. I determined then that I would fight and continue to fight and to encourage other’s to attend this conference so they too can make lifelong friendships and get all the updates on research, treatment and support for people living with a stage IV breast cancer diagnosis. I was diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in December 2009. I had to ask my doctor, “Well how many stages are there?” My doctor responded, “Sheila you have the worst one.” As you can imagine, my heart felt like it had exploded and my whole body went numb. I needed to know more about metastatic breast cancer and meet women like myself who were living with this diagnosis, and learn if they felt the same way I did emotionally and physically. I was a total wreck when I learned I had stage IV breast cancer. I knew nothing about stage IV and I didn’t have anyone I could relate to. Living Beyond Breast Cancer has been a true blessing in my life. I was introduced to LBBC by my support group, the Young Women’s Breast Cancer Program in St Louis, Missouri, and what a joy it’s been! I soon learned about the amazing conferences LBBC hosted, and I thought attending one would be a great opportunity to meet those who understood the same battle that I faced every day. I wanted to ask other people living with stage IV breast cancer questions like how they deal with side effects and what questions I should ask my oncologist.

LBBC’s Arin Ahlum Hanson, manager of the Young Women’s Initiative (left) and YWI Program Coordinator Ingrid Mapanao (right). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend all premenopausal women diagnosed with breast cancer be informed about the potential impacts of treatment on their fertility and asked if they would like to have future pregnancies. LBBC’s national needs assessment of over 1,500 young women affected by breast cancer found that only half of the young women surveyed reported discussing fertility issues with their healthcare providers. Of those women who did discuss fertility impacts with their providers, the majority of those women initiated this important discussion with their healthcare providers rather than having their healthcare providers bring up the subject. LBBC is working to close this communication gap by educating healthcare providers through an upcoming webinar. Healthcare providers participating in this webinar, Fertility and Breast Cancer: Educational Opportunities and Preservation Options , will learn about fertility preservation options available for young women and how breast cancer treatments impact fertility. The webinar will be held on March 18 from noon-1pm ET and the guest presenter will be Kristin N.

Guglielmino, MA, concludes our TNBC Aware series with this post about LBBC’s survey findings and the needs of women diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. One morning several years ago, an LBBC colleague rapped on my office door. She was distressed. She had just spoken to a woman with triple-negative breast cancer, a term we had only recently started using after it appeared in scientific journals. The caller was crying, despondent. She had gone online to learn more about her diagnosis, which websites described as “rare,” “aggressive,” and “difficult to treat.” Someone she trusted had asked her why she couldn’t “just take one of those drugs I keep hearing about on the news.” Why, the caller pressed, does it feel like there is nothing and nobody out there for me? That call was not the first LBBC had received about triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, a subtype that does not respond to therapies targeting estrogen, progesterone or HER2 receptors. Almost daily, we heard from women who felt deeply anxious and worried about their future. Those with early-stage TNBC feared recurrence, while women with stage IV demanded research to expand their limited their treatment options. All clamored for more, better, evidence-based information that could guide them through diagnosis, treatment, and beyond. It was clear LBBC needed to take action. We partnered with the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation on a Guide to Understanding Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and a two-part webinar series, held each April. We developed a website section on TNBC, posting subtype-specific research news and clinical trials. But we knew we needed to do more. We needed evidence we could share with anyone who serves people with TNBC. So in 2012 we sought funding to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of women with TNBC, modeled closely on LBBC’s previous studies for women with metastatic disease and premenopausal women. Working with researcher Kathleen Swiger, MPH, we recruited an executive committee of advocates and prominent clinical professionals with a research interest in TNBC. We interviewed seven healthcare providers and women about their experiences, and held focus groups in four regions. We then designed an 80-question online survey, informed by these activities, to answer one key question: Do women with TNBC want education, information and support tailored to the cancer’s triple-negative status?

156,23,88,3,3,2015,2015-03-03,"Blogger Anna Craig wrote this original post about living with stage IV triple-negative breast cancer for our TNBC Aware series. I am 38 years old and I have stage IV triple-negative breast cancer. This is the bad kind of breast cancer that no one really talks about. It is incurable and will ultimately take my life. Triple-negative breast cancer is defined by what it is missing. It is the left over breast cancers that do not have one of the three known receptors; estrogen, progesterone and HER2. More likely to occur in young adults, triple negative makes up 15% to 20% of all breast cancers. We are a minority. Living with metastatic breast cancer is like playing a game of Whack-A-Mole, where each person has a finite bag of mallets. When a metastasis shows up on a scan you try to whack it on the head with a mallet. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. When it doesn’t, you grab a new mallet and keep whacking until you run out. As you can imagine, the bigger your bag of mallets the more likely you are to extend your life. Unlike HER2- and hormone-positive breast cancer, triple negative does not yet have targeted treatments like Herceptin. My treatment options, outside of clinical trials, are limited to chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. This means my bag of mallets is much smaller. Having metastatic breast cancer in your 30s is complicated. As with most young people my age, I am in the thick of my life. I have two small children and a budding career as an architect. Until cancer, I was healthy, active and ambitious. I had patiently begun to build my life. I had even started to discover things that inspire me to dream without limits. My life was just starting to take flight, when in an instant, cancer happened and my world crashed at my feet. I’ve always been a person who embraces the idea that life is a journey. I pictured my career as a long twisting road of discovery. My twenties and thirties would be about understanding how buildings work and how materials come together. I would take time off to have a small family. I would balance my career and my ambition with parenthood. Life would be thick, active and vibrant. In my forties and fifties, I would start to come into my own. I would create a body of work that was imaginative and inspiring. My buildings would have spaces full of light, texture and meaning. In my sixties and seventies, I would travel the world and work on a few special projects. My buildings would reflect my wisdom and grace. I would be an eccentric old architect with lots of grey hair, wrinkles, colourful socks and brightly patterned clothing. Triple-negative breast cancer with its never ending toxic cycles of chemo derailed that life. Instead of balancing my career with my family, I have spent days and weeks in bed. Cancer can be very isolating. Sometime I get so trapped in my illness and my discomfort that I struggle to relate to the people around me. The more time I spend in bed, the more my dreams and passions drift away. Often I feel very alone, vulnerable and angry. Continue reading →",0,1,0.05943237796686073
157,23,89,3,3,2015,2015-03-03,"Speaker and Integrative Cancer Care and Wellness Coach Eileen Fuentes on how triple-negative breast cancer connected her to her cultural roots. Eileen also included a recipe below! Wellness and healthy living has become very trendy. It seems as if everyone is sipping on smoothies and doing yoga. While I have always been health-conscious, the messages I was receiving in the media confused me about what to eat and how to live. Like many women, I thought low-fat anything, artificial sweeteners, and highly processed foods were good for me. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) at 34 years old that I made it a point to really understand how to eat and live in order to reduce my risk of recurrence. What makes TNBC unique is that there are no targeted therapies to treat it and it has a poorer prognosis as compared to other breast cancer subtypes. While I’d agree with you that this cancer is definitely “negative”, the name actually refers to the fact that the cancer is estrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (ER-), and HER2/neu negative. This disease also disproportionally affects premenopausal women and those of African-American and Latino heritage. The fact that I fit into both categories and had no family history motivated me to look closer at what I could do given my limited medical options. Below are 5 lifestyle changes that I made that were beneficial: No matter how I felt, I always exercised regularly including simple movements like walking or more vigorous activities like qigong. I began my spiritual journey to learn more about myself, my purpose, and to seek guidance on my post-cancer life. I maintained a journal, which later turned into a newsletter for my loved ones, and ultimately a blog. I stopped using toxic products on my body and reduced the toxic thoughts I allowed to entire my mind. I used to food to reduce the side-effects of cancer treatment and to connect me to family/caregivers. Continue reading →",0,1,0.09738433441558439
158,23,9,14,2,2016,2016-02-14,"In anticipation of our Feb. 24 Twitter Chat –and Valentine’s Day– we’re reblogging a post from Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Mandi Hudson. A version of this post appeared on Mandi’s blog, Darn Good Lemonade. It was reblogged with permission by the author. When you are faced with cancer decisions, there are certain levels of expectations: surgery, chemo, maybe radiation. One of the unexpected bits is that hormone receptive cancers change a lot. If you were on birth control that could get shoved out the door. Your menstrual cycles end up all wacky and then there is menopause. Menopause from chemo, menopause from removing your ovaries, menopause like symptoms from taking medications like Tamoxifen. They also don’t warn you that along with everything your body has gone through and changes in learning to love your body that is left at the end of treatment (or during the never-ending ups and downs of metastatic treatment)… blocking your estrogen impacts your intimacy. Things change down there that you just don’t expect. I have dived into various ways to be a wife in her 30’s that is physically close to her husband, but it is a part of life that you just don’t prep for emotionally. There are different ways to improve the situation, although I sometimes just wish I could bathe in pools and pools of estrogen. There are a variety of ways to create intimacy in your relationship. Being close. Holding each other. Finding what works for you and what works for your partner. Communication is key. Kissing is fun. Enjoy my blog post: ____________________________ This isn’t my first brush with menopause. I did a temporary version when I was in chemo, my doctors expected it to be temporary since I was under 35. I have electronic access to my medical records and labs, so when new ones go up I get an email. I didn’t realize my oncologist had ordered a test to check on my menopausal state (measuring estrogen). The results look like I was still pretty pre-menopausal – I guess a 30 would have been extra-super-duper pre-menopausal: Needless to say, the last minute check that my ovaries were still working before my surgery suggested that they were. Tamoxifen also gave me every side effect they could list related to menopause, so it will be interesting to compare the two in the upcoming future (blocking estrogen vs. complete lack of estrogen… hmmm). Of course we were intentionally putting me into menopause. So I guess that makes it a little different. The surgery I officially had was a “unilateral salpingo oophorectomy.” This means they removed my ovaries and fallopian tubes from both sides. My oncologist and OBGYN at Huntsman felt like a full hysterectomy was an unnecessary risk – and now that I had surgery I am glad it wasn’t a bigger surgery. I am surgeried out. While we waited for me to go into the operation room we did one last final wave goodbye to my ovaries. Mike was not present just yet, since he needed a root canal and ended up having to get it while I was in pre-op (teeth grinding at night from stress is dangerous to your teeth folks). Apparently I wasn’t supposed to have my blue hat just yet (they took it off when they saw our photo brigade). I was hiding my bedhead. I had showered the night before and rolled out of bed to head to the hospital. Plus it gives the extra “surgery chic” look. I did not feel amazing right after surgery. I wasn’t about to hop on any stages, sing, do jazz hands or any of those things I normally avoid after surgery anyway. I warned them my nausea can be a tough one, but they seemed to keep it under control while I was at the hospital. We got me home and I went to bed for awhile. I eventually woke up and relocated to the living room for a bit. Everything was making me nauseous. Water. Looking sideways. I kept carefully hobbling to the glass doors (holding a pillow around my belly) and poking my head out into the cold gulping for air. I took my anti-nausea medications and after I ate dinner (my friend’s dropped off my favorite ramen soup) and it all just came up. Gross. I complained to my mom in true grown up style and she explained that my digestive system was probably still paralyzed post operation. … The first couple of days I started to wonder when menopause was going to kick in. I felt fine. Hot flashes hadn’t started back up since I had stopped Tamoxifen. Emotions felt ok. I was wondering if everything was magically going to be easy. Two days after surgery I remembered I still had a uterus and that I was going to have a final cycle. FIRE SALE! Oy. I think that is about when my body realized estrogen was gone. Today I discovered I lost a $50 bill that Mike had left for me on the counter. This started with me searching the house fervently super pissed off that I lost it (and grouching at Mike for having left it out when I couldn’t put it away in my purse) and ended with me in huge tears and sobbing that I had lost it (with Mike comforting me and talking me down from my hormone induced craze) – I still haven’t found it but, oh goody, menopause… I found you!

159,23,90,3,3,2015,2015-03-03,"Julie Wolfe blogs about the emotional impact of her diagnosis, learning about triple-negative disease and genetic testing, and beginning chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer. It is amazing how important dates stay in your mind. They become part of your narrative, your story. If you hear the story of my diagnosis without the dates, it does not convey the level of intensity. And I am a really intense person. On Friday morning, December 27, 2013, I had a mammogram and was asked to stay for an ultrasound. As a really big busted 40-something woman, this was not uncommon. What was originally a relaxed ultrasound jumped into high gear. There was something wrong, I needed a biopsy. “Ok, let’s go!” I said. But I couldn’t have the biopsy without consulting with a breast surgeon. I was told to come back the following Monday at 8:30 a.m. My plan was to do the biopsy alone. As my husband took radiographic images for a living, he understood better than I did how bad this could be. By the time I told him about the biopsy he could not take off work on Monday morning. Maybe retail therapy with my visiting sister, a cancer survivor herself, would keep my mind off of it. Nope. Several hours later, at the end of shopping, I say, “By the way…” but she knows the tone and has had the worry. Without discussion, she decided she’d come with me for the procedure. Before the end of the weekend, half my family knew, but not my two other living siblings, my parents, or my stepson. On December 30 , I had the biopsy and it was official, I knew I had CANCER. Not what type; that would come later. With the holiday and a big storm rolling in, I convinced my doctor to expedite the test results. It was January 7, 2014 at 4:55 p.m. before I finally found out what type of breast cancer I had. It was a quick conversation over the phone with no additional information. After the biopsy I had no choice but to tell my parents and most of the immediate family. But I didn’t want to scare my parents too much so my husband, sister, and I went together to tell them. It was very reminiscent of the January day 2 years earlier when all the siblings and spouses went to tell them their son, my brother, had died. The next night, New Year’s Eve, my husband and I stayed in. He was so stressed and worried that he went to bed at 9 p.m. I stayed up, hugged my dogs, and cried. When family and friends texted my Happy New Year messages, I texted back with smiley faces and wishes for a happy year, never letting on about the worry and anguish I felt. I wanted so much to tell them all but did not want to ruin their nights with something they could do nothing about. Without a doubt it was one of the worst nights of my life. Based on the advice of my doctor and the desire to stay as sane and calm as possible, from December 30 which was my diagnosis of cancer to January 7 when I found out I had triple negative breast cancer, I decided to do no research. There was, and is, an unbelievable amount of information online, much of it depressing. When I started to research I made the decision to only visit web sites that ended in .org. And at the beginning I did not read blogs or comments, only information from reputable sources. The very first site I visited to find out about triple-negative breast cancer was www.nationalbreastcancer.org. The site had a very easy to understand graphic and description of TNBC. It was also terrifying. As an overachiever with a sense of humor, I read the site and thought to myself, “Of course I have an aggressive and difficult to treat cancer.” The first few pieces of relevant information I read are the ones that have become fixed in my mind: TNBC is a very aggressive, fast moving, and difficult cancer; of all the breast cancers it had the lowest 5-year survival rate at 77 percent. Since I was young and of Ashkenazi background it could mean I had the BRAC 1 or BRAC2 gene mutation. Continue reading →",0,1,0.04196834415584416
160,23,91,3,3,2015,2015-03-03,"For our TNBC Aware series, Helpline volunteer and LBBC blogger Ronda Walker Weaver discusses her experience coping with and understanding a TNBC diagnosis. I have been a volunteer for LBBC’s Breast Cancer Helpline for about 18 months. Interestingly, I often receive calls from women who have triple-negative breast cancer. Typically they are scared – lots of negative stories about TNBC, and they wonder what is ahead of them as far as treatment and survival. Triple-negative breast cancer can seem like a life-sentence to many women. The triple-negative means our cancer is not responsive to “typical” breast cancer treatments that target other subtypes.(Although, really, what is typical? – all women should have individualized treatment plans.) The biggest, most generic difference is that other breast cancers are hormone- or HER2-positive. So in addition to treatment like surgery, radiation and chemo, women with these types of breast cancer receive some type of therapy that targets the hormone or protein growth (this may be taken daily for 5-10 years). TNBC is not hormone or protein responsive, so we usually have some combination of surgery, radiation and chemo, regardless of the size of our tumor, and that is it – we have one chance at killing our aggressive cancer rather than a prolonged chance. Typically if TNBC doesn’t not reoccur in 2-5 years, we’re considered NED (no evidence of disease), but those first 5 years are filled with careful monitoring/screening and fear.

Sheryl (left) with her sister, Triple Step Toward the Cure founder and CEO, Lori Flowers (right). Cancer does not run in my family. But general health and longevity do. Both sets of my great-grandmothers lived to be almost 100 and were largely independent even into their last days. My grandmother is 97 and sharper than many half her age and both she and my mother look younger than their years. I always attributed this to our Caribbean heritage. So naturally I expected that genetics along with the salsa dancing and the patacones we grew up eating would help carry my sister, Sheryl, and I into ripe-old age. However, that legacy was not enough to protect my beautiful and brilliant sister who was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in January 2008 at age 40. I had no idea what was required of me but I immediately went into action mode, and assumed a role that was a constant mix of caregiver, therapist, comedian, and cheerleader. Despite the circumstances, there were many wonderful moments and lessons learned. As the eternal “little sister,” I now had an opportunity to step up for my shero.

I was diagnosed with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer in October 2012. I was visiting with my daughter in Florida with my fiancé in September. While showering, I felt a mass in my left breast – it was hard and I was terrified. When I got back home I called my primary care doctor and went to see her. During the appointment, she said she didn’t think it was anything to worry about. With that I was supposed to be appeased, but I wasn’t – I knew something was wrong. I insisted that I wanted a script for a mammogram and ultrasound. I went for these tests the same day and the radiology technician said preliminarily that the lump looked abnormal – the technician suggested I see a specialist. I went back to the doctors very upset. I saw another doctor and he referred me to a breast specialist whom I saw the next day. The specialist was wonderful and comforting and insisted it was early and “we caught it.” “How do you know that?” I asked. I wanted to make sure. I semi-digested the news and was ready to begin my treatment plan. Then I learned that my PET scan showed the breast cancer had metastasized to my lymph glands and liver. I didn’t even know what that word metastasized meant or what any of this meant. Tests also revealed that I was diagnosed with triple-negative disease. Another term I had never heard. That was scary.

163,23,94,3,3,2015,2015-03-03,"Roxanne Martinez contributed this blog post for TNBC Aware. She reflects on her experience from getting diagnosed after learning she was pregnant, to becoming a triple-negative breast cancer advocate. Triple-negative breast cancer. I was devastated to receive the diagnosis in November 2010, shortly after learning I was pregnant. My entire life flipped upside down. With a rollercoaster of emotions, I turned to the Internet to learn everything I could about the disease. None of what I read was encouraging about triple-negative breast cancer – the particularly aggressive type that is more likely to recur than other subtypes of breast cancer. Prior to my diagnosis, I didn’t even realize that there were different types of breast cancer. With no family history of the disease, I was left to navigate the unknown and forced to become my own health advocate. Fortunately, I found online resources and support networks, such as the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation and Living Beyond Breast Cancer, that connected me with other women battling the disease. I knew I had found the right medical team to treat my breast cancer when I shared my intent to carry out the pregnancy and my oncologist informed me that there were options to do so. Timing would be everything in my case. Based on the size, grade and aggressiveness of my tumor, my medical team recommended a treatment plan that included an immediate mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy — all while pregnant. I would begin chemotherapy during my second trimester, when research has shown to be safe for an unborn child. After much research, soul-searching and prayer, I proceeded with treatment. Though it was a rough pregnancy, my baby’s resilience, along with fellow cancer survivors and a nationwide support network nicknamed Team Roxy, kept me going strong and inspired me through my journey. The physical side effects of treatment were only part of the battle. Coping with breast cancer while pregnant made me an emotional wreck. There was absolutely nothing any doctor could tell me that would alleviate my fears. I wouldn’t be at ease until I could physically see and hold my baby. That time would come sooner than I imagined.

Melissa discusses how she coped with diagnosis and treatment, what it was like adjusting to her “new normal” and how she gives back to others with TNBC. My name is Melissa Stukenborg Paskvan. I’ve been married for over 22 years to my high school sweetheart and our son just turned 13 years old. I am very involved in the breast cancer community here locally as well with social media with sharing information and reaching out to women in their fight with triple-negative breast cancer. I also like to travel to meet several of my TNBC sisters. My breast cancer experience began in August 2009. My husband and son had just left for vacation when I found my lump by chance. I felt something along my bra band line under my breast and my heart sunk. I was in disbelief that my worst fear was now happening to me. I reacted fast and two days later I got in for a mammogram followed by an ultrasound. My 2 cm lump did not show up on the mammogram images because I had dense breast tissues. It was thought to be just a cyst but I insisted on a needle biopsy right then and there. Another two days went by, and I received the call from my doctor. I was 41 and diagnosed with cancer… I was numb. I never cried, I wasn’t angry but I was really scared, scared of the unknown. Suddenly, nothing else mattered, I couldn’t see pass “today”. Can you imagine all the fear racing through my head and trying to keep myself together, especially since my husand and I did yet tell our son? Two long weeks later, I met with my surgeon who told me that I have a rare and aggressive form of cancer that doesn’t respond to hormone therapy. My surgeon told me that my tumor was invasive ductal carcinoma with negative receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER2 but, she didn’t use the term, triple-negative breast cancer. It wasn’t until I met my oncologist a month later that I learned my cancer was actually referred to as triple-negative breast cancer, when she told me that my cancer was aggressive and we’re going to be just as aggressive fighting it with dose dense chemo every other week. I turned to the internet to learn more about this tumor of mine, and I was really frightened with what I read about its aggressiveness. So little was known about this disease 5 years ago. What I learned left me feeling defeated before my battle even started. Continue reading →",0,1,0.003026801629742811

Jennifer Stringer Staggs kicks of our series with a post about being newly diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, worrying about her daughter and sister, and finding support and community online. When my provider told me that I had triple-negative breast cancer, I was overwhelmed. Before learning my diagnosis, I Googled the different kinds and triple negative scared me the most. I read a lot about this type of breast cancer, and was told a lot of things that scared me. For example, I heard that if I had triple-negative that my chances of survival would be less than if it was hormone-sensitive, and that there was more of a chance it was genetic and could be passed on to my children. My provider gave me a lot of information, but I found the best information going on Facebook and finding breast cancer forums. Diagnosed at age 29, I did not want to go to a local support group that had a huge age gap. It was a lot easier for me to get information and support online because everyone there either wanted the same information or already went through it. It felt more like a sisterhood in the forums. Nobody judged the questions I had and they were able to tell me what to expect from the treatments I was about to receive. I got some of the best information going to Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Fall Conference. I listened to professionals explain what triple-negative meant and what kind of treatments and side effects to expect. They also had an expert speaking about young women going through all of this and what to expect from “chemopause” and changes in your sex drive. I learned so much information there that none of my doctors covered. Having triple-negative breast cancer made me very concerned for my daughter and my sisters and their kids. I worry they could still get cancer, even though I tested negative for the BRCA gene. I don’t want any of them to have to go through what I have had to endure.

166,23,97,2,3,2015,2015-03-02,"A metastatic breast cancer diagnosis can be overwhelming. But no one needs to face it alone. In 2014, Lesley Glenn attended LBBC’s Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer after learning of her diagnosis. Lesley, a wife, mom, daughter, friend, artist, blogger and metastatic breast cancer “thriver” is an arts integration specialist with Students Pursuing Literacy through Art Together (SPLAT), an initiative that she created for the City of Long Beach’s Afterschool WRAP programs. This year, she is training to summit 14,500 feet on Mount Whitney for her 50th birthday. And, she “loves her life.” This is her story. Lesley Glenn My name is Lesley Glenn, and I am a metastatic breast cancer “thriver.” I call myself a “thriver” instead of a “survivor” because I choose daily to flourish and prosper in my life despite cancer. I was first diagnosed with stage IIB ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in November 2012. What words are there to describe this life changing event? Jolted, rocked and rattled are just a few. However, I resolved in my mind that I could give 8 months of my life to treatment, because at that time, this is how long my doctors told me it would take to “beat” this. And I was in it for the fight. It never crossed my mind that they might find other suspicious “spots” in my body, and when they did, I was still committed to my 8-month plan. However, chemo took its toll on me in the first 8 weeks of treatment, and I found myself spending a good portion of a month in the hospital, with a life-threatening case of sepsis. It was at this very low point that I knew something was not right, and after getting out of the hospital, I stopped all future chemo treatments and demanded a second opinion. Through the course of what I call serendipity, I was led to a team of amazing doctors at Kenneth Norris Cancer Center at USC, who offered a treatment plan that nurtured my whole person, body and soul, back to health. It was during this time that I was diagnosed with metastatic disease – meaning the breast cancer had spread to another area of my body, in my case the bones in my right shoulder. My 8-month plan was now erased with what could be a life-long condition. The learning curve got a little more confusing. “Allow yourself to feel every emotion that comes your way, knowing that you are not alone in the journey and there are others who are going through the same thing.” I no longer fit in with the women who had stages I-III of the disease, and sometimes felt like the “elephant in the room” when it came to sharing my experience with others whose breast cancer had not progressed to metastatic. While starting to make sense of my stage IV diagnosis, I found an online group called Club BC Mets, which was created specifically for women with metastatic breast cancer. As part of this group I began a dialogue with others who shared the same journey as me, most of whom were further along in their diagnosis, and had been thriving for years with metastatic disease. It was here that I learned about LBBC’s Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer in Philadelphia. I read up on it and thought it might be good for me to be with other women, women who understood what I was experiencing. At first, considering the costs involved I didn’t think I could attend. But then, I happened upon their travel grant and fee waiver program and decided to apply. LBBC has made the process to apply for this financial assistance so easy, and within just a couple weeks I was given both the travel grant and fee waiver. I went back to my online support group, asked if anyone else was attending and if so, if anyone was looking for a roommate. This was my introduction to Jill, who was the moderator of the group. She was also attending on a travel grant, and we decided to room together in Philadelphia for the conference. I flew into Philadelphia very late the Friday night before the conference was to begin, excited, nervous and a little apprehensive. When I got to my room, Jill had already checked in. She graciously greeted me and we talked for a few hours before calling it a night. Saturday morning came, and we made our way downstairs for the start of the conference. It was at that moment as I entered the main conference area that I started to feel very overwhelmed. I was catapulted into a sea of women, who were all at different stages of metastatic disease. I remember taking a deep breath, and giving myself a mental pep talk…”You can do this, Lesley.” But then, seeing all the other women around me led to the following thought: Did any of us really want to be here? Because this is not the kind of conference one might typically say “HEY, I want to attend this!” Attendees at last year’s conference enjoy a moment of fun. Yet, we were all there for a purpose – to know we were not alone. As the day unfolded, as providence would have it, I met several women who also felt the same way I did: overwhelmed and just a tad guilty. Guilty because we were a percentage of those with METS who are called oligometastatic, or those having 5 or less areas of metastatic disease. Having these women to dialogue with was an encouragement. However, what was more inspirational were the women who were 5, 10, 15 years in, who cheered us on and made us feel normal. As if there was or is a normal with cancer. My roommate Jill was literally my Godsend for the weekend. Every thought, every question, every time I wanted to hide, she gently pulled me up and helped me to make sense of all it. While I took away lots of meaningful information from the LBBC Mets Conference, it was the relationships that were forged that made the difference for me in my first year attending. “You are not alone in the journey and there are others who are going through the same thing.” One year has gone by, and I have grown so much in my quest to thrive with mets. I believe that if I were to attend again this coming year, I would be more prepared as to what to expect, and what I would be looking to get out of the conference. If I were to encourage first timers, my best piece of advice is “Expect everything, expect nothing. Allow yourself to feel every emotion that comes your way, knowing that you are not alone in the journey and there are others who are going through the same thing. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and give yourself mini time-outs for when you feel overwhelmed. But mostly, know that this tribe of women are all on your side, willing and excited to cheer you on through your journey with mets and beyond. This year, you can connect with other women at LBBC’s Annual Conference for Women Living with Metastatic Breast Cancer. The event takes place April 11 – 12 at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel and travel grants and fee waivers are available for those who qualify.

I came out to my primary care doctor when I was 16 years old. I had come out to a few close friends in the weeks before, and they didn’t handle it well. After that, my anxiety gradually increased. I had been meaning to make a doctor’s appointment for other reasons, so this anxiety pushed me to schedule a visit. There were words before and after “I’m gay,” but I couldn’t help but focus on those two. After I said them, my stomach and chest felt as if they twisted into knots. My doctor’s face didn’t change; she maintained her relaxed facial expression and asked me questions about the anxiety I had. We then talked about what was going on. Before the end of the appointment, she told me not to hesitate to contact her if I had other questions or concerns, or if I needed someone to talk to. My doctor was affirming, which was something I really needed at that time. That’s not always the case. Among the different barriers and disparities lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face when seeking health care, getting quality care that’s sensitive is a major one. Forms in the doctor’s office or a hospital sometimes offer very limited ways to describe your relationship or gender identity. Providers may make assumptions. Biases may directly or indirectly impact a provider’s approach to care. This is why it was important to me to write Breast Cancer inFocus: Getting the Care You Need as a Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual Person for Living Beyond Breast Cancer. There are advocacy organizations and other institutions working hard to educate, inform and train healthcare professionals on adequate care for LGBT people. Things are improving – just look at the Healthcare Equality Index – but there is still much work to be done. LGBT people with breast cancer cannot afford to wait for this work to be finished before receiving care. I wanted to create a resource that could empower and help LGBT people while that systemic work continues. I also wanted this publication and related online content to include personal stories of LGBT people affected by breast cancer, so that readers know they’re not alone.

169,26,1,10,4,2016,2016-04-10,"Published at: 02:04 pm - April 10, 2016 Me, about a zillion years ago. “My heart is not any age. It is a baby, an elder, a dog, a cat, divine.” — Anne Lamott, ‘This is the last Saturday of my fifties’ Two years ago, thanks to a friend, I stumbled on the fact that writer Anne Lamott and I were born on the same day. We were both about to turn sixty. Since I like her writing, and her attitude, and since I share a lot of the same attitude, I’ve found it quite helpful to share my birthday with her. If I’m stuck for thoughts about life, I can look up some of hers, and find that we’ve often reached the same conclusions. When I was trying to come up with a title for this post that summed up how I feel about being sixty-two, I remembered the above quote. People sometimes say that the key to growing older is to be young at heart, but I find that notion inadequate. Sometimes I feel young at heart, like when I’m laughing with friends, or singing to my cat, or drawing for hours on end, or marveling at the wonders of the universe. But sometimes, I need to be old at heart, old in wisdom, old in lessons learned, old in kindness and compassion, old in perspective. I distinctly remember feeling old at heart when I was seven, and facing another example of my mother’s mental illness. Feeling old enough not to take her craziness personally kept me sane. I was sixteen around the time the above photo was taken. It was not a sweet sixteen. I was struggling, like every teenager, with that roiling stew of hormones, self-consciousness, and insecurity. But I also realized I was drowning in depression, and my friends were worried about me. With good reason. My parents were fighting nearly all the time, hurling threats about leaving each other as soon as I was out of high school. If I’d had anywhere to go, I might have left home there and then, just to call their bluff. I’d also fallen deeply in love in that mind/body/soul way for the first time, and then been abandoned after several months without explanation. I was shattered. But I was still resourceful. I found out about a health clinic in Harvard Square in Cambridge, at the other end of the train line from where I lived, that offered free counseling services. I decided to get some. Among the mostly young, mostly nervous souls in the waiting room was a friendly, suspiciously cheerful young man who struck up a conversation. He was tall, blond, long-haired and buff, kind of rock-star hunky, but he didn’t act like he thought he was god’s gift. He was just a sweet dude who, I’m pretty sure, was high on weed, but was nonetheless engaging and unassuming. I think his name was Kevin. We shot the shit about music and life and what-all until he was called in for his appointment. A few minutes later, I was called in for mine. When the counselor sat me down and asked me what was wrong, I cried wordlessly for about ten minutes straight. That was my baptism in the arduous, cathartic ways of psychotherapy. When my fifty-minute visit was done, and we’d made another appointment, I felt wrung out but lighter. And a little less alone. As I left the clinic and walked toward the subway station, Kevin was coming toward me from the opposite direction. “Hey!” he said, raising his arms in greeting like I was an old friend. “Hey, yourself!” I said, smiling. Before we could, presumably, resume our previous conversation, he caught me up in his arms, bent me over backwards, and laid a long, passionate, enthusiastic kiss on me. A serious lip-locker. A literal traffic-stopper. Even my toes tingled. Drivers honked their horns. Pedestrians applauded. My life became a scene from a movie. When Kevin was finished, he righted me, told me to have a fantastic day, and strolled away. I stood there, breathless, not sure whether I should run as fast as I could to the subway or turn around and go after him. I like to think wisdom prevailed, and I decided instead to get myself a chocolate-chip ice cream cone at a nearby Brigham’s. I sat in the sun while I ate it, smiling at life’s mysteries. I never saw Kevin again, but that was okay. I didn’t need to. “You wandered down the lane and far away Leaving me a song that will not die.” from “Stardust,” lyrics by Mitchell Parish, song by Hoagy Carmichael A lot of my life has been like that day, rife with heartache and struggle, but punctuated by some moment of astounding balm and unexpected clarity. Recently, I was treating a young woman who was recovering from a complicated orthopedic surgery. We had a lot in common. We both worked in science-based professions, but liked to write and make art. One day, she was talking about the pressure she felt since turning thirty to figure out what to do next in her life. She loved her job, for which she got paid to write, and her employers were kind and accommodating. But she felt unsatisfied. Like me, she had an undergrad degree in the humanities, but wondered if she should she go back to school and get a science degree. But in what? She loved art, too, but would it make sense to get an art degree and not be able to get a job in it? She had a boyfriend she loved, but didn’t know how she felt about the whole marriage/kids thing. She also suspected that recovering from surgery left her with too much time to think and that perhaps she was driving herself crazy, something she was only too good at doing. Still, she worried that she had wasted too much time just falling into things without a clear game plan. I told her how I’d felt the same way at her age, how I think that our thirties are like that, a decade when we feel pressure to figure out this adulthood thing once and for all, and get a move on. Then I told her how I felt like I’d always been a late bloomer, but that it turned out to be a good thing in the long run. I told her how I’d spent my twenties, trying on and discarding several identities and potential career options, from rock star to painter to poet to magazine editor to would-be academic. I told her how I’d ended up deciding to go to grad school to become a physical therapist, and didn’t finish my degree until I was forty. I told her how, at fifty, I finally spent some serious time making art, got into a lot of juried art shows, and won awards for my photography. I told her about starting a blog, teaching myself to write code, breaking into Photoshop’s mysterious depths and using it to create a few infamous memes, and finally landing a side gig getting paid to write now and then for a healthcare website. “Holy crap!” she said. “How old are you?” “I’m going to be sixty-two in a few weeks.” “Shut UP!!” she said. “First of all, you so don’t look it. Or act like it. Wow. You don’t know how much better this makes me feel. I’ve got all kinds of time, don’t I?” A little stardust. Being Silver Today, on our birthday, Anne Lamott re-posted something she’d shared on Facebook on last year’s birthday: “Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared, even the people who seem to have it more or less together. They are much more like you than you would believe. So try not to compare your insides to their outsides.” Amen to that. My insides and outsides still bear the marks that cancer has indelibly left behind. Last year, right before my annual physical, I decided to try yet another strategy to see if I could kick more of this beast I’ve been living with ever since treatment, the beast known as fatigue, a little closer to the curb. Trust me — I’ve tried everything in the last seven-and-a-half years. This time, I decided to try to eliminate most of the sugar I was consuming. Not that I consumed a lot, but I’d been relying a bit too much on a mid-morning muffin to give me enough of a rush to get through the rest of my patient visits, and a post-work cookie or three to get me through my patient notes. I wondered if I’d feel better if I stopped spiking my energy level with sugar, only to have it plummet later on. So, I stopped eating desserts — muffins, ice cream, cake, pie, Dare Chocolate Crème cookies. I still ate a little dark chocolate every day, but none of that other stuff, except as a rare treat. Long story short, since last June, I’ve lost that last ten pounds of post-cancer-treatment weight-gain I never thought I’d get rid of. And yes, my energy has evened out. I still need naps, and I still need my days off to recuperate from my job, but I feel much more like my old self. I also decided to start letting my silver hair grow out. I took a long, hard look at my roots, which now appear to be about half silver, enough finally to make a statement. So, at last week’s appointment, my splendid hairdresser stripped the color from a massive pile of strands, toned them silver, and left my roots to do what they will. Part of me wishes I could have Emmy Lou Harris’s hair right away, and be all silver. But I realize this is a long-term project. A lot like life. There’s a lesson in all this about growing into myself — reclaiming some of my old self, embracing my present self, preparing for my future self. One of my best friends called me last night to talk to me “while you’re still sixty-one.” I told her I was looking forward to being sixty-two. She asked me why. I told her I didn’t know really, but I just wanted to be myself, whoever that is. I told her how wonderful and symbolic it was to be able to fit into some of my old, favorite clothes again. I told her about that thirtyish young woman I’d visited, and how I’d described to her that my being a late bloomer had allowed me to do all kinds of amazing things long after being thirty. I told her how she’d said I’d helped her feel better about herself, and how I realized that telling her my own story made me feel better about myself, too. “Who knows what I’ll do next?” I said to my friend. “But for now, I just want to be fabulous at being sixty-two.” That’s enough. That’s plenty. Posted in: Attitude, Fatigue, Life & Mortality, Survivorship by Kathi 14 Comments birthdays, cancer related fatigue, growing older",0,1,0.10368426886583308

174,26,14,22,7,2015,2015-07-22,"Published at: 03:07 pm - July 22, 2015 Like nearly all of us with a breast cancer history, I’ve read (quite a lot, maybe too much) about the now-infamous latest study on mammography and mortality, published July 6, 2015 in JAMA. If you want to slog through the original, it’s at this link: Breast Cancer Screening, Incidence, and Mortality Across US Counties. Like many of you, I imagine, it makes my brain hurt. In particular, the study appears to have the most disturbing implications for those of us at either end of the breast cancer spectrum, namely, those of us initially diagnosed with DCIS, and those of us initially diagnosed with advanced and metastatic breast cancer. For women like myself, who were diagnosed with and treated for DCIS, we have to wonder if the whole blasted sleighride was pointless and unnecessary. For those whose initial diagnosis was late stage breast cancer and even metastatic breast cancer, we must all feel shock, dismay and extreme frustration that these cancers were not detected earlier. How is that even possible? What the everloving heck?? Earlier this week, I was contacted by a journalist to ask me if I’d be willing to be interviewed about it. She had already reported on the study when it was published, and was looking to talk to a few folks who’ve been diagnosed with breast cancer to discuss our reactions. At first, I wasn’t sure I was up to it. But I decided to agree, after checking out the journalist herself and the magazine for which she writes. That interview was scheduled for today, but it’s been postponed while she and her editor do some further thinking about the direction of the piece. The good thing about agreeing to be interviewed was that it forced me to pull some of my thoughts together. And I decided to share them here. I am frankly not equal to reinterpreting the study directly. But now that I have read the thing, as well as reports on it, a number of issues — old issues, in fact — have been brought to my mind that have been reinforced by my reading, issues I hope do not get lost in the fray. Non-Invasive Breast Cancer: Overscreened and Overtreated? Frankly, I’m a little tired of all the flap in recent years about DCIS. When I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2008, I did get pathology reports that interpreted the nuclear grade of my lesions. But the implications of these grades was still fuzzy at the time, and my reports did not all say the same thing. The only thing they stated unambiguously was that none of my lesions were low grade, and that they were somewhat widely scattered. This NEJM study report, published about six months after I was diagnosed, stated that both high nuclear grade lesions and widely scattered lesions were found to be more likely to recur invasively. It also reported that 13% to 24% of women who got stereotactic biopsies of DCIS lesions were found to have invasive cancer in those biopsies. Another study, published after I had surgery and was just finishing radiation, identified new genes in DCIS lesions that were potentially involved in the malignant transformation of DCIS. So, that’s the state of play I and my doctors were dealing with back then. In the years since, pinpointing which DCIS lesions may turn invasive — and which probably won’t — has been the subject of much research that has yet to achieve certainty. So far, researchers have only been able to determine that some DCIS can and does become invasive if left untreated, and that even if treated, can and does recur in invasive form. But widespread agreement on how to predict its behavior has yet to arrive. A lot has been written about the overtreatment of many, if not most, DCIS lesions, and the trauma attendant to this overtreatment, up to and including women who opt for having bilateral mastectomies. While I would be the first to admit that I would gladly have avoided my entire treatment extravaganza and its aftermath, until we know for certain how to assess DCIS thoroughly and accurately, much of the flap about it, including whether to call it cancer or not, strikes me as premature, if not downright unhelpful. To quote Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist better known to fans of his blog as Orac: We can overcome the problems of overdiagnosis and overtreatment due to cancer screening. Developing better screening tests will not be sufficient to achieve this end, however. What will be required is the development of predictive tests that tell us which lesions found on mammography or future screening tests are likely to progress within the patient’s lifetime to cause death or serious harm and which are unlikely to do so. Such information would allow us to stratify cancers into those that need to be treated promptly and those that can safely undergo “watchful waiting.” This will not be an easy task. In the meantime, we do the best we can with the data that we have—and its uncertainty. Couldn’t have said it better myself. In the meantime, could everyone please drop the hype and hyperbole about DCIS? I don’t know about anyone else, but it has not made me feel any better. The long-term damage that I live with since being treated for DCIS was not caused by the fact that the stinking calcifications, whatever their potential for invasive recurrence, are gone and have thankfully stayed gone for seven years. It was caused by the collateral damage and long-term side effects of the treatment that made them gone, and it’s the sort of damage that every cancer patient endures, not just those of us with DCIS. In the meantime, I can happily live without being subjected to further shrill, ill-considered discussion of DCIS. To quote Shakespeare, “it is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing.” And What About That Collateral Damage? This has been the subject of many, if not most, of my blog posts. We all know what it is. Virtually all of us have some. There is more research these days, but probably not enough research, in my humble opinion, about how to mitigate it after the fact, make it disappear entirely, understand it in the first place, or even how to get oncologists and other physicians to acknowledge that it bloody exists at all. Thank goodness, there is also more research being conducted these days about how to avoid it. Which leads me to my next topic. Could We Have Better Treatment, Please? Another blog post. Or six. Better treatment means more targeted therapies; less collateral damage; smarter drugs with fewer side effects; better surgical techniques; better access to clinical trials; better sharing of data; more accurate statistics for all types of breast cancer; better tumor tissue registries; better health insurance and healthcare access; better treatment protocols; improved standards of cancer care; treatment and drugs that do not bankrupt the people they are supposed to be helping; etc., etc., ad infinitum. Better-Trained Radiologists? Not unexpectedly, many of the objections to and criticisms of this mammography study, as well as others that have questioned its efficacy, have come from radiologists themselves. However, as many of them would admit, not all radiologists are created equal, nor are they all as well-trained and experienced as they ought to be. It is documented elsewhere (another blog post in the making) that American radiologists do not employ the same criteria for mammographic interpretation as, for instance, their colleagues in Europe. That includes the interpretation and follow-up of findings for dense breast tissue. I have also read articles stating that European radiologists report fewer false positives than their American counterparts, suggesting that they read breast images more accurately in the first place. My own current breast surgeon shakes his head in disgust at the local disparity of competence among clinicians, not only in the interpretation of mammograms, but of MRIs and breast ultrasounds. Come on, people. Don’t we have enough certifying organizations in the U.S. that define competency and provide continuing education to get you all up to speed? Oy. Better Imaging Tools Let’s face it: mammograms are so last century. And while there may be criteria for suggesting when to follow up a mammogram with something else — like diagnostic or 3D mammography, MRI or ultrasound — that doesn’t mean that these criteria are consistently followed, or that the imaging is conducted competently, or that these options are even readily available to all. There still continues to be disagreement about the efficacy and accuracy of these tools, along with breast thermography and nuclear imaging. Seriously? This is 2015, and we still don’t have better imaging tools? What’s up with that? Other Screening & Diagnostic Tools Lots of research is being done to develop predictive and diagnostic blood tests. Very interesting, very promising. Fingers crossed. Here are some links: Blood Tests to Detect Breast Cancer & Monitor Response to Treatment New Test Predicts Breast Cancer Recurrence Blood Test Could Be More Accurate Than Mammograms Blood Test Can Predict Breast Cancer Before Occurrence Blood Test Shows Promise in Breast Cancer Detection The Really Bad News For me, the most alarming, unbelievable, disheartening and intolerable implications of the mammography and mortality study are these two: (1) that, apparently, more mammograms did not result in fewer deaths from breast cancer, perhaps because (2) more mammograms did not lead to finding fewer incidences of advanced and metastatic breast cancer, which one might expect if all this stepped-up screening was working as promised. The first of these conclusions is a thorny subject, rife with a variety of interpretations and disagreements, and must be understood within the context of the study limits and parameters. The study’s researchers have themselves taken some pains to make these clear. So has Dr. Gorski, aka Orac. In the first place, the study subjects were diagnosed in the year 2000, and a lot has changed since then. Also, other similar longitudinal studies of mammography and the reviewers who have interpreted them have come to very different conclusions. However, the tendency of these types of studies in recent years has been to support the conclusion that mammography has not decreased breast cancer deaths, or not enough deaths to justify using it as widely as we have been used to for many years now. The controversial 2009 recommendations published by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force are themselves undergoing revision, but appear at this point to mirror the mortality study — namely, mammography is still useful, but not as useful as we thought. And it’s really not so useful to women under age 50, usually not even mentioned to women under age 40 unless they have a family history, and that individuals must discuss the whole thing with their doctors, who themselves may not know what to conclude. But, it’s what we’ve got, and we can’t go tossing it out until we have something to replace it. Great. Where does this leave all of us? Where does it leave women without a family history, who develop metastatic breast cancer in their thirties? Where does it leave minority women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of breast cancer at a younger age? Up the blasted creek? It seems to me that we are left almost exactly where I concluded we were left a few years ago: stuck with diagnostic tools that are flawed and inadequate; making the best of treatment that is imperfect, damaging, and too costly in every sense of the word; and very much in need of a far deeper understanding of a complex, still-deadly disease.

176,26,16,31,5,2015,2015-05-31,"Published at: 02:05 pm - May 31, 2015 When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, I felt like I was stepping down an indifferently-lit staircase into the Vast Unknown. At the time, the notion of nurse navigators was relatively new in my locale, and there were as yet none available. I could have used one. There was a dedicated breast health center, where clinicians from all the area hospitals who treated breast cancer could see their patients, along with a multi-hospital weekly tumor board where they could discuss treatment plans. Thus, my breast cancer surgeon, my radiation oncologist and my medical oncologist each worked for different hospitals, but I could see them in the same area and coordinate communication with them through the breast health center. Theoretically, that is. In practice, things didn’t work out that way. Instead, as I struggled to make treatment decisions, I also struggled with poor access, poor communication, poor coordination, and incomplete information. If I’d had a nurse navigator, she might have smoothed some of the bumps. Now, as a homecare physical therapist with a specialty in oncology rehab, I deal with oncology nurses and nurse navigators regularly, from various cancer treatment centers. And they do help, especially when I or my patient just doesn’t know who the heck to call about a particular issue. But the road to coordinated cancer care is still bumpy for many patients. When I began doing some research for this post, I was surprised to learn that the concept of cancer patient navigators was first conceived in 1990 by Dr. Harold Freeman and his colleagues at New York’s Harlem Hospital [Efficacy of Oncology Nurse Navigators]. And in practice, oncology nurse navigators have been around since the late 1990’s [Report on a Study on the Role of the Oncology Nurse Navigator]. Since then, defining their role has been a complex, ongoing issue, as well as defining the knowledge they need to perform their jobs. To add to the challenge, not all cancer patient navigators are specially-trained nurses, and some are not nurses or even clinicians. Some navigators are social workers, and some are lay people. As such, they may fulfill somewhat different roles in cancer care. In a study published in February, 2012 in the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved [Cancer Patient Navigators & Their Role in Cancer Care], the role of a navigator is defined as “an individual trained to help identify and resolve real and perceived barriers to care, enabling patients to adhere to care recommendations and thus improve their cancer outcomes.” These barriers may be economic, as well as lack of access to basic information about symptoms and preventative care. Thus, navigators may play a role across the spectrum, from screening to acute cancer treatment, to palliative care and survivorship care. Recognizing this need to improve cancer care and to reduce cancer incidence and treatment disparities in the U.S. healthcare system, in 2007, the National Cancer Institute launched a pilot program [NCI Community Cancer Centers Program] in community hospital-based cancer centers to “support cancer research and enhance the quality of cancer care at the nation’s community hospitals.” Part of this program was to require cancer patient navigators. The hospitals that have taken part in this program have been studying ways to: •Reduce cancer healthcare disparities •Increase patient participation in clinical trials •Improve quality of cancer care •Enhance cancer survivorship and palliative care services •Expand use of electronic health records and connect to cancer research data networks •Promote collection of high-quality biospecimens to support genomically-informed research (also known as personalized medicine) [quoted from the previous link] In 2014, this program was replaced with the NCI Community Oncology Research Program in order to “conduct multi-site cancer clinical trials and studies in diverse populations in community-based healthcare systems across the United States and Puerto Rico” in order to allow “access to a larger and more diverse patient population in a variety of ‘real world’ healthcare locations.” Meanwhile, cancer patient navigation continues, as well as efforts to refine the definition of the navigator’s role and the knowledge base needed by oncology nurse navigators in order to perform their jobs. So, what do they do? Here’s a summary from Cancer Patient Navigators & Their Role in Cancer Care: In my clinical experience with navigators, particularly nurse navigators, what they generally do when one of my patients has been diagnosed with cancer is to accompany them to each doctor visit, to help fill in the blanks about their treatment options and the potential risk vs. benefit of each option, to provide emotional support and facilitate practical support, to help coordinate care, and to serve as a go-to person when problems arise. In particular, I think one of most meaningful roles they can play is to help ensure that patients understand their treatment options and understands their efficacy and potential harms. I say this because I find that it is still too often the case that cancer physicians themselves either do not have the time to explain everything and answer all questions, or that they present only one treatment recommendation and do not inform the patient that there may be others. Patients are usually and understandably so overwhelmed and shocked by the reality of their diagnosis, they don’t even realize sometimes that they have a right to ask questions. Many patients are intimidated by questioning their doctors at all and may not feel brave enough to disagree with them or insist that their doctors address quality of life issues. A nurse navigator can really make a difference in such situations, so that the patient can arrive at treatment decisions that are truly informed. Not all oncologists are alike, nor are navigators. Recently, I came across an article [You Have Nothing to Lose] by Lee Newcomer, who runs a cancer care center, about how an oncologist recommended treatment to a friend’s wife that did not reflect complete and current evidence-based information about this woman’s particular breast cancer. It underscored how important it is to have a thorough and honest discussion about risks versus benefits of treatment, and of the need to get a second opinion. We all want to be able to trust our doctors, but we also want the best treatment for us as individuals, with a full consideration of the impact of treatment on our lives. I could write another post entirely about recommended best practices for oncologists. Also recently, I discovered that two of the navigators I deal with, who work in the same cancer center, see their roles differently. One of them tends to stick to the party line, as it were, explaining the side effects and efficacy of the particular treatment an oncologist recommends, but not offering information about other options that the oncologist may not have mentioned. The other is much more likely to encourage a patient to get a second opinion, to outline other options, and to emphasize that the patient has the right to disagree, question and be fully informed before making any decisions. It can be uncomfortable for nurse navigators to know that a certain oncologist, with whom they must regularly interact, may not be disclosing all the information a given patient needs for informed consent. It’s important for all navigators to have a consistent understanding of their role, as well as the support and education they themselves need to fulfill that role. Another incident occurred recently when a patient attended her first chemo infusion. Her chemo nurse found that this patient had only a rudimentary understanding of the potential side effects of each of the drugs in her chemo cocktail, and immediately called a pharmacist to the scene to help her explain them to this patient and to the family member who accompanied her. This patient had a navigator, but somehow did not understand what she needed to deal with the treatment she was about to undergo. There can be a lot of reasons for this. As many of you know, it’s extraordinarily difficult to obtain and understand all the information you might need to make treatment decisions, and to understand all the ramifications of those decisions. It often feels like we are required to take, in effect, a crash course in clinical oncology in order to understand what is going on. Not every patient is equal to such a task, nor are her family members. Many patients still prefer to just leave all the decisions up to their doctors and endure the consequences. In the meantime, researchers continue to study the efficacy of oncology nurse navigators, sometimes struggling to come up with parameters that truly reflect the value of the role they may play in cancer care. One such study reviewed the current research on this subject [Efficacy of Oncology Nurse Navigators]. Looking at 18 studies, it organized data by “rationale for implementation of nurse as navigator, study patient populations, navigator educational preparation, and measurable patient outcomes such as the time to diagnosis and treatment, effect on mood states, satisfaction, support, continuity of care, and cost.” Among other things, it outlined the difficulty of measuring navigator effectiveness in terms of cost of care, but also found that “nurse interaction with patients and families to mutually identify unmet needs; inform, teach, and support; and coordinate and promote the continuity of care” represent a valuable service that can improve patients’ experience of treatment and its outcomes. I hope those of you who have had a patient navigator will comment and share your experience, and that those of you who did not have one will share how a navigator might have improved your experience. Personally, I think we need all the help we can get. All the links mentioned in this article, plus some resources, are listed below.

I used to joke that I was drawn to you because you were ‘an older man,’ not by much, but still, twenty-four was ‘old’ for a sophomore.

178,26,18,28,3,2015,2015-03-28,"Published at: 09:03 am - March 28, 2015 When I was seven years old, my mother decided to impart some previously undisclosed details about my birth. I’d already heard, many times, along with several relatives, how much I’d weighed, that I was a happy baby, that I’d slept well, that I was the first grandchild on my father’s side of the family. Birth itself was still something of a mystery to me. I knew that babies grew in their mothers’ bellies, but I wasn’t sure how they emerged from them. My friend Suzie’s big sister had recently informed us that giving birth was sort of like peeing, except it hurt more and took a lot longer. I didn’t think any further information was necessary. I also already knew that my parents had been married for three years when I arrived. By the time I was seven, they’d been married for ten years. My mother once told me that she’d had a number of miscarriages before I was born. She didn’t say if she’d had any after. She never told me what a miscarriage was, but I figured out it was some kind of unexpected, physical cancellation of pregnancy. She’d also told me several times that she’d always wanted to have more children after me. “It’s your father’s fault I haven’t had them,” she’d said. “He hasn’t been — romantic enough.” Once, when she was in one of her states, she told me it was my fault she hadn’t had them. But that happened later, when I was a little older. Whatever the cause, the consequence of all this was that my parents had no other children. This did not seem advantageous to me. Being an ‘only’ put me under too much pressure. It was, however, nice to have a spring birthday. Easter was always near my birthday. For my seventh birthday, I’d gotten a very large Easter basket and an orange kitten. I’d named him Sweetpea. He liked sleeping on the paper grass in my Easter basket. He was also not averse to letting me wheel him around in my doll carriage. Since my birthday, my mother had been fond of pointing out that, at seven years old, I had attained the Age of Reason. Whatever that meant. Just an excuse, I thought, for telling me more things I really didn’t want to know. I believed that there were just some things that mothers should not tell their children, whatever their age. It was okay for Suzie’s big sister to tell us a few home truths. She was one of us, after all. But mothers, I thought, should just keep some things to themselves. Normal mothers did, I was certain. But my mother was not a normal mother. Sweetpea was asleep in my doll carriage when my mother announced, in mythic tones, that she had A Few Things to tell me. Sometime in the hours after I was born, she said, her doctor had told her that he believed I’d had a twin who didn’t make it. Something about the afterbirth, he said. It had not been, he thought, an identical twin. I was stunned. I wondered how the doctor might have figured that out. In those days, they didn’t have ultrasound machines to determine prenatal womb occupancy. What was the something about the afterbirth, I wondered. Was there a tiny dead body in it? My mother didn’t say, and I didn’t ask. She also didn’t say what an afterbirth was exactly. She did tell me now that, missing twin aside, after all those previous miscarriages, she was just relieved I’d made it with all my working parts intact. I wondered if all those miscarriages had involved tiny dead bodies. Still, I felt somewhat reassured. I was afraid she might have been disappointed that she’d only ended up with me, and not with both of us. It seemed a little cruel to me to end up, say, with chocolate ice cream, only to find out you were meant to have both chocolate and strawberry, but that the strawberry had been cancelled at the last minute. She admitted that she was unconscious during the crucial part of the proceedings. “Knocked out,” was how she put it. Once again, she mentioned that I’d weighed nine pounds, seven ounces. Before, I’d thought my higher-than-average birth weight was a point of pride, like an athletic achievement. Now, I wondered if I should feel guilty about it. Then she said that, despite my birth weight, she hadn’t had to have a C-section, which, I gathered, was some kind of surgical procedure conducted to remove extra-large babies. The reason she hadn’t needed one was amusing, she explained. When the nurse first placed me in her arms, she thought perhaps they’d made a mistake and given her someone else’s baby — not her newborn girl, but some one or two-month-old who was visiting the maternity ward. I weighed a lot, she said, but I was also twenty-three-and-a-half inches long. She sat back, grinned at me, and folded her hands. I stared at her, not grinning, and hoped there was a punchline.”Don’t you see?” she said. “You were so long and skinny, you just slid right out!” Sometime after I was considerate enough to just slide right out, that ominously suggestive afterbirth followed me. Certainly, I was relieved that I hadn’t forced my mother to have a C-section. But why she was telling me all this? What was the point? How was I supposed to react to such information? I couldn’t tell. I also knew that my reaction was not uppermost in her mind. It never was. She just had to get this off her chest. Again, I wondered why she chose to unburden herself to me, and not to some grownup. Was there a subtext? Perhaps it was because I had evidently continued to be a rather considerate child. I was a good listener. I didn’t ask a lot of difficult questions. Perhaps it was because I was just there. Whatever her reasons, for now, her story was done, and, as usual, I was left to ponder it unaided. I wheeled Sweetpea into my room and shut the door. I began to wonder about my missing twin. I imagined it was a brother. It could have been a girl, a non-identical sister. But I was sure it was a brother. I wanted it to be a brother. How was I supposed to feel about the fact that he hadn’t survived? Did that make me a murderer? Had I committed infanticide in my mother’s womb? Had I somehow robbed him of nutrition, elbowed him out of the way, and gobbled it all up for myself? Is that why I weighed so much at birth? Why didn’t he defend himself? Was it just the size difference? Was my zygotic self always bigger than his? Did I accidentally or deliberately kick him to death with my long, skinny legs? Did we get tangled in a sibling embrace that choked the breath out of him? Or, due to my overwhelming volume, did I just smother him to death? Or was it even my fault at all? Was it possible for a woman like my mother to have a sort of partial miscarriage? Did my mother’s body decide, by some mysterious process, that it could only handle bringing one baby at a time into the world? Was I the product of some Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest contest over which I had no control? Wow. My options appeared to be that (a) I was a murderer, (b) I was a clumsy, unwittingly dangerous oaf, (c) I was too competitive, and (d) I won some contest I didn’t know I was participating in. Ultimately, I couldn’t decide which one applied. And it almost didn’t matter. Whatever happened to him, I felt bereft. I wondered what life would have been like with a twin brother. Would my mother have divulged so much unsavory information to both of us, or to just one of us? Or to each of us one at a time? We could have at least compared notes afterward. It would have been helpful to have someone with whom to discuss the states my mother sometimes got herself into. Like the times she was convinced that the neighbors, or my father’s fellow ushers at church, or the women of the neighborhood coffee klatch, were all conspiring against her. I wondered what my brother would have looked like. Would he have dark blond hair and blue eyes like me? Or brown hair like my mother? Or hazel eyes like my dad? Would our parents have liked one of us more than the other? Would my dad have recruited my brother, and not me, to help him develop photos in his darkroom? Or would he have put us both to work, hanging negatives and uncurling prints off the photo dryer? Would I have been spared the boredom of having to hand my father various tools while he tinkered with the car? Would I have gotten a kitten for my birthday? Would we both have gotten kittens? Would we have the same friends? Would the boy next door, who’d kissed me on the cheek one day in his back yard and then run away, have been my brother’s friend instead of my first romantic interest? Would my brother have slugged him for kissing his sister? Would my brother and I be on the same side in our epic neighborhood snowball fights? Would we even like each other? Of course we would, I decided. We were twins, after all. Maybe he would play with trucks while I played with dolls, but we could still play games and build forts and do puzzles together. We could push each other on the swings. We could still be allies when our parents had one of their screaming matches over dinner, ducking our heads together when they threw dishes at each other. I wouldn’t have to run, alone, to my room to cry afterward. I wouldn’t be an ‘only.’ All the pressure wouldn’t be on me. It was really too bad that he didn’t make it. I missed him. A lot.

179,26,19,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Published at: 11:03 am - March 24, 2015 There are a lot of folks out there who manage to get back to their pre-cancer fitness after treatment. Some of them even exceed their pre-cancer fitness. They run marathons, practice yoga regularly, take up kick-boxing, do spin classes or zumba, or walk three miles a day. I admire these folks unreservedly, but I am not one of them. This post is not for them. This post is for the rest of us, for whom just getting out of bed in the morning is often a struggle. Personally, my greatest athletic feat after cancer was going back to work. I used to work full-time. I’m not up to that anymore. First, I worked half-time, then eventually I crawled my way back to working four days a week instead of five. I had bills to pay, after all. I work as a homecare physical therapist. For a long time, I had to take neuro-stimulant drugs to combat fatigue and brain fog so I could get through my work day. Now, I manage on caffeine. I once got myself a pedometer to see how much running around I really did. The results were somewhat ambiguous. So, I got an accelerometer, but it burned through batteries too quickly. Basically, a pedometer measures movement in 2D, while an accelerometer measures it in 3D. My advice to the average person about getting such a device? Save your money. Here’s my own advice to patients about exercise: don’t fuss about how far you walk or how many exercise reps you do. Just do something, and keep track of how long you spend doing it. Time is the most pertinent measurement anyway when you’re just trying to mitigate the effects of all those hours that you can’t pry yourself off the couch. As far as doing something goes, I will admit that my job has its advantages. I see six patients on an average day. I schlepp a heavy bag loaded with a laptop and medical accoutrements. When I visit someone at an apartment complex, I usually have to park far from the door and hoof it to the entrance. I take the stairs between floors when I can. I’m not one of those physical therapists who sits and watches her patients laboring away. I always do the stuff with them. One demo is worth a thousand words of instruction. Conservatively, I’d say that I spend at least a quarter of my average work day engaged in significant movement. That’s about two hours out of eight. And it’s probably more than that. No wonder I’m exhausted when I get home. Exercise after work? I don’t think so. It’s what I do or don’t do on my three days off a week that’s the problem. All these years later, I still catch myself comparing my current energy level and activity tolerance with my pre-cancer self. Big mistake. I was a ball of fire before cancer. Now, when I’m not jacked up on coffee while slogging through work, I’m more of a limp noodle. I’ve tried all kinds of things to entice myself into getting more exercise on my days off. I get paid to invent exercise programs, after all. A few years ago, I even bought myself a rowing ergometer, which used to be my favorite cardio machine at the gym. I still enjoy it now and then, but there are a lot of days when I just don’t have the wherewithal to unfold it and turn on the monitor. I also know I’m not alone. Not only am I not alone in the Cancer Club, but I spend every day figuring out how to teach recently-hospitalized people who don’t feel like getting out of bed how to get up and move. Finally, it occurred to me to take some of my own advice to them. And to pass it on to you. Hence this post. I should also say at this point that, if you’re at all unsure about what you can or should do, especially if you have pain or lymphedema, ask one of your doctors to send you to a physical therapist first. Or get one sent to you at home. When You Don’t Feel Like Getting Out of Bed, Don’t. You can do a lot of exercise while lying down. Really. Even without throwing the covers off. If you’re reluctant to get up, just lie on your back (which is supine, as we PTs call it), stretch your arms out sideways and inhale deeply. Then hug yourself while you exhale. Repeat a few times. Then, pump your ankles up and down, slowly and methodically, several times. Next, tighten your butt muscles, hold for a few seconds, relax, and repeat. Then do likewise with your knees, straightening them as much as you can. If you feel friskier by now, you can try sliding your legs apart and back together a few times. Next, you can try to bend one knee and slide your heel up. Then slide it down. Repeat with your other leg. You might think all this is no big deal, but this is basically what we PTs teach all our patients who have just had joint replacement surgery. And it works. If you feel capable of throwing off the covers, you can try the supine exercises diagrammed on these two PDF’s: (1) simple back/leg exercises and (2) slightly less simple back/leg exercises. I put them together for people with sore backs, but you don’t have to have a sore back to do them. If you do have a sore back, I’ve put the links to the original posts at the end of this one. Upright and Taking Nourishment If you’ve managed to get up, crawl to the kitchen, eat some breakfast, and sit in a chair, there are lots of other things you can do. One of them is to stand up and sit down again several times in a row. This is essentially a squat, but easier and safer than a full squat sans chair. It’s a great, effective strengthening exercise, and there are several versions. If you need to use your arms to push off, no problem. Just try to stand up as straight as possible for a few seconds before you sit down again. If you can do it without pushing off, you can brace your hands on your thighs to help you stand. You can also try standing up from your chair with your arms folded across your chest. Or with your arms raised straight out in front of you. The main thing is standing up straight once you’re on your feet, making sure you feel your back, butt, knees and lower legs doing their thing. The magic is in repeating it two or three or ten times in a row. Honest. Simply amazing. Another thing you can try in a chair is to lean over your own lap, let your arms hang down, and try to touch the floor. Don’t worry if your belly gets in the way or your shoulders are too tight to reach that far. It works better if you sit with your knees and feet apart. It’s a great way to stretch out your back. Just hang there for ten or twenty seconds, and when you get over the headrush, suck in your belly muscles and roll yourself upright again. And, of course, try repeating a few times, reaching further each time, if possible. You can mix things up by stretching your arms over your head as you sit up. Sort of like doing the Wayne’s World ‘We’re not worthy’ wave, but without the rock stars. Say you’ve been sitting up for a while, checking your email, your Facebook page, your Twitter feed, and uploading a few pix to Instagram. Probably an hour or two has gone by. Time to move again. Don’t be afraid: you can still stay in that chair. Just push that laptop away, let your arms hang down by your side, and shrug your shoulders up and down. Shrug them ALL the way up and ALL the way down, slowly and thoroughly. Five times or ten times. Then squeeze your shoulderblades together, hard, several times. Hang your head forward and let your neck stretch out for several seconds. Then look straight ahead and slowly, gently, turn your head to one side and stretch it, and then turn to the other side. Slide your feet forward so your heels are resting on the floor, and pump your ankles up and down methodically. No ‘flapping.’ You want to feel your calf muscles working. Maybe try standing up a few times. Maybe even try standing up, moving your laptop to the kitchen counter, and checking your social media while standing. Just for a few minutes anyway. Taking A Stand Don’t worry. I’m not going to go off on you and load you up with a lot of fancy standing exercises. Really, I’m just going to encourage you to stand. There have been a lot of articles published about the benefits of simply standing, so I’ll let you do your own search for them. In one article I found, a physician claimed that, over a year, standing for a cumulative total of three hours a day had the same health benefits as running 10 marathons. I’m not sure if I could pull off standing three hours a day myself, but the point is that being a couch potato is detrimental to our health. In an excellent post by Carolyn Thomas, who blogs about women and cardiac disease, she quotes a leading cardiologist who shares some astonishing info. Even if you manage to perform that much-touted 30 minutes of exercise a day, if you spend most of your day sitting and not moving, as many people do, you’re still in much worse shape overall than people who get off their butts periodically. The point is NOT to slump motionless on the couch all day, but to move around now and then. I’m also not talking about standing rigidly in one position. In fact, I don’t recommend that, especially for people with back problems. I’m talking more about doing a little something when you stand, something you’d normally do while sitting, like sorting your snail mail. One of my tricks is to turn on the radio and see if I can stand for the duration of the average song or news story. You could just stand there and listen while texting your friends. If you feel ambitious, you can add some further movement by loading the dishwasher or unloading that carton of canned cat food you ordered for your favorite fur baby. In fact, any attempt at those much-dreaded household tasks while standing is helpful. Like sorting or folding laundry. Or polishing the silver. Whatever. I worked on some of this blog post while standing. You get the idea. The Bottom Line The point of this post is not to flog you into doing something you really can’t do. I’ll save the complicated stuff for a subsequent post. The point is that, whether you’re vertical or horizontal, using your muscles some of the time, even just a little, is better than not using them at all. Pretty much any and all movement of any joint larger than your thumb will work. Or just using most of your major muscles to fight gravity by standing will work. It all counts. It doesn’t have to take longer than a few minutes. In fact, the other point here is that lots of benefits accrue by doing a little at a time, but doing it several times a day. Do keep track of it, too, and add it all up at the end of the day. You might be surprised. Two minutes here, five minutes there, it adds up. Recently, I visited a patient just home from having a few stents placed to make it easier for her heart to pump blood through her body. She felt like she’d been run over by a truck. I got her to agree to take a five-minute walk around her house each day. By our next visit, she said she’d spent the last few days taking two five-minute walks around her house each day. It wasn’t exciting — it was a small house. But, she felt enormously better. In fact, we ended up taking a walk outside that day. It really doesn’t take much. Just move your bottom.

180,26,2,23,3,2016,2016-03-23,"Published at: 03:03 pm - March 23, 2016 Where’s my cancer GPS? For those of us who have completed initial treatment for breast cancer, what to do next may be a big question without a ready answer. Often, it gets harder to answer that question the further we get from the date of our original diagnosis. We may get some kind of screening every year. We may be told we are still NED. We may still be taking some kind of hormone suppressors or we may have quit taking them. We may have managed to get on with life despite the continuing fear of recurrence or mets. And yet, we may very well still feel like utter excrement and not know what to do about it. Some of us may continue to see one or more of our cancer doctors on a regular basis. Some of us may be followed mainly by our primary care doctors. But many of us have never discussed with them any sort of overall strategy for what, for lack of a better word, has come to be called survivorship. We may not even get asked about long-term collateral damage, and if we bring something up, we may get a shrug or a prescription for a lab test. But what we don’t get is a road map. I was prompted to write this after reading a post written by my friend Eileen about how she’s been doing lately. Still plagued by fatigue, she describes how she is being followed mostly by her current primary care physician, who doesn’t seem to know how to help her and is not receptive to her suggestions. What the ever-loving heck? Back in 2010, I wrote a few posts about the existence of survivorship care plans. The first post highlighted the publication of a book by the Institutes of Medicine called From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition. Yep. Pretty much says it all. Later that year, I followed up with another post that described in more detail the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control, which began in 2003 to formulate, with the help of several other organizations, a national action plan to develop and implement the use of cancer survivorship care plans. A pdf of a patient-centered brochure describing the plan may be found at this link. 2003?? So, what happened? In 2011, The Oncologist published an article about how to maximize the benefits and effectiveness of these plans. The most obvious conclusion to be drawn from this piece was that the healthcare system was still figuring out how to do them in the first place. A few years later, the Journal of Cancer Survivorship published a study that assessed the status of the CDC’s national action plan. The organizations included in this assessment were the American Cancer Society; CancerCare; CDC, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control; Livestrong Foundation; and the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. Twenty-two people were interviewed for this assessment, a group comprised of organization directors, clinical supervisors, and staff who directly managed relevant activities. The study did not specifically mention the inclusion of physicians or oncologists, nor were any actual cancer survivors interviewed. Table 2 lists the priorities identified by the original action plan. They all sound good, but the study found that implementation was a lot more complicated. Overall, it seemed that most recommendations were put into place, but that there was a lot of room for improvement. One feature of the action plan was the use of patient navigators, who may play a role during acute care as well as survivorship. One of my previous posts, written last year, discussed the availability and effectiveness of these navigators. In 2014, a study conducted by the University of Ottawa questioned the cost-effectiveness of the survivorship care plans used with breast cancer patients. The study found little difference between standard follow-up care and care provided according to a survivorship plan. Survivorship care plans were, in fact, found to be slightly more expensive, but the authors suggested that their cost-effectiveness might be improved by better identifying patient needs, using health information technology, and improving data collection. Another study was completed in 2015 at UCLA to look at the use of treatment summaries and survivorship care plans for underserved breast cancer patients at two public county hospitals. Results have not yet been published. I feel more lost than ever. Meanwhile, one of the original goals of the CDC’s action plan was for each of us to get a written survivorship care plan. I’m still waiting for mine. And I am still wondering whether our doctors even know how to write one. To that end, I unearthed a few resources to help our doctors help us. The simplest one appears to be a template designed by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO). The details, aimed at healthcare providers, are described here. A description geared toward patients can be found here, and recommendations specific to breast cancer patients are described here. The template itself is about two-and-a-half pages long, and I’ve included it as a downloadable pdf here. You could perhaps bring it with you to your next appointment with the doctor of your choice. You could probably even fill in a lot of it yourself. And, naturally, there’s an app for this. JourneyForward provides a downloadable program which can be used by you or your doctor for building a survivorship care plan. The link to this software is here. Yes, I did download it, and, yes, I started filling it in. But to do a good job of it, I would have had to look up a bunch of crap I didn’t feel like looking at right now. Maybe later. I hit the motherlode when I visited the website for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Never an organization to leave any stone unturned, NCCN provides an evidence-based tome for practitioners describing how to assess any and all cancer survivors and what elements to include in a survivorship care plan. If you thought ASCO’s two-and-a-half page template was long, the NCCN’s guidelines are a whopping 179 pages. A pdf of these guidelines can be found here. I suggest clicking on the link for the Survivorship Table of Contents on the upper right and going from there. It’s really quite impressive. The guidelines discuss the role of primary care doctors (page 98), and list the elements that should be included in a summary provided to cancer patients upon the completion of treatment (pages 98-99). These include: a personalized treatment summary information on possible late and long-term side effects information on signs of recurrence guidelines for follow-up care identification of providers recommendations for healthy living identification of supportive care resources Looks perfectly splendid, doesn’t it? The chances of getting all this from our doctors? Not so much. However, as long as we cancer patients can read, at least we can use these guidelines as tools to help us look after ourselves. And hope our doctors will want to go along for the ride. In the meantime, I’d love to hear from you about your experience with this. Did your doctors provide any sort of plan or summary of your treatment? Who do you see now for follow-up care? How is it going? Are you getting what you need? Me, I could use a winning lottery ticket. It wouldn’t fix everything, but it would surely help.

181,26,20,31,1,2015,2015-01-31,"Published at: 10:01 am - January 31, 2015 ‘A focal point for visitors today, the gateway sign says “Work Will Set You Free,” a monstrous lie told to the men, women and children imprisoned there. (Maciek Nabrdalik)’ [Smithsonian.com] “…tolerance cannot be assumed …. it must be taught. And we must make it clear that hate is never right and love is never wrong!” — Auschwitz survivor Roman Kent, speaking at the memorial ceremony for the 70th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz I am writing this on a cold January day. On the ground are the remains of the nearly two feet of snow that fell here a few days ago, on January 27th, 2015. That day was also the 70th Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, perhaps the most infamous concentration camp, and surely one of the most evil monuments to hatred constructed by the Nazis during World War II. The weather on that long ago day in Poland may well have been like this one in southern New England: the wind gusting strongly, cutting through skin and clothing like a frigid knife. “At least 1.1 million people were killed here, most within hours of their arrival.” — Andrew Curry, writing about Auschwitz for Smithsonian Magazine, February, 2010 As I sit here, I am warm, safe, and well-fed. I am still alive, despite cancer, grief, the viscissitudes of occasional misfortune. I am doing two of the most powerful things any of us can do in the face of bestial human cruelty — I am remembering and I am writing. I am remembering a small handful of friends and their parents, Jewish friends of my generation, and their parents who were imprisoned in concentration camps and managed to survive. I am remembering the cordial, dignified father of one of those friends. He scarcely ever spoke of his experience in the camp, but it was always there, like a base note humming underneath his posture, his demeanor. It vibrated with the conflicting emotions of survivors’ guilt. With every intention of preventing his children from feeling that guilt, they inherited it anyway, a burden of helpless sorrow and wordless resolve that infused their perspective, their self-esteem, their choices. I am remembering a woman I met several years ago. I was visiting her to perform a home physical therapy evaluation. She had recently come home from the hospital and was feeling weak and unsteady. She was a charming lady who spoke with an accent that sounded Eastern European. Her house was cluttered with old furniture and memorabilia. In the background was the sound of soft clucking from the hens she kept in a large coop behind her house. I petted her sweet old dog. And I admired a large, elaborate cage full of vividly colored Australian finches, a gift from her son, who was present to help. She offered me tea, coffee, lunch, egg salad, cake, each of which I politely refused. Her son and I discussed ways to rearrange some furniture to create safer pathways for her and her walker. She was tiny and bent with arthritis, but fiercely alive, her face crinkling throughout our visit into an irrepressible smile. She resisted several of our suggestions, but always with charming persuasiveness. “I’m old, but I get around okay,” she said. She again offered me a drink, a sandwich, cake. Again, I declined with a smile. As we were wrapping up our visit, I asked her about her accent. “Where are you from originally?” I asked. “I am from Auschwitz,” she said. And as she said it, I noticed that one of her sleeves got rucked up, and tatooed on her arm was a row of numbers. My eyes instantly filled up, but somehow I managed not to cry. We gazed intently at each other for a few eternal seconds. Finally, I said, “I am very glad you are here.” “Every one of you is the guardian of the memory…” — Bronisław Komorowski, the President of the Republic of Poland, at the Memorial Ceremony for the 70th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz As I was packing up to leave, she insisted that her son fetch me a dozen eggs. “Fresh,” she said, with her remarkable smile, “very good hens. You take.” I hoisted my work bag over my shoulder and accepted the carton. “I’m very glad to have met you,” I said. “Thank you,” she said, patting my hand. “You a good girl.” I managed to get into my car and drive to the end of her driveway before I had to stop the car. I sat and wept for several minutes. Every day over the next few weeks, I would tear up whenever I cracked an egg, and say a silent prayer. Today, this week, I weep again and I remember. I will always remember. It is the very least I can do.

182,26,21,14,1,2015,2015-01-14,"Published at: 03:01 pm - January 14, 2015 First, a few general remarks. I didn’t write many posts last year, but I kept a lot of notes for future topics. A lot of those topics combine the knowledge I’ve gained and explored from the major aspects of my life: my cancer experience, my personal life, and my work life as a healthcare clinician. I like that. It makes me feel like I’m finally integrating the messy, fragmented existence I’ve led since I was diagnosed into some kind of whole. This post covers one of those topics. Medical Alert Services: Communicating Your Medical Reality Back when I was helping METAvivor publish their blog, I published a great post written by Susan, of The Uppity Cancer Patient called Medical Emergencies and the Single Girl. Lots of my homecare patients wear medical alert bracelets, but Susan’s post provides a lot of information about how to use this service in ways I did not then know about, but which I have since passed on to many people. Most of us probably regard these bracelets and necklace pendants as simply notifying emergency personnel that the wearer has diabetes or a significant medication allergy. But, as Susan found, that’s just the beginning of the story. It can also enable medical personnel “to quickly find my emergency contacts, talk to my doctor, find my living will, and receive an up-to-date list of all my medications and conditions.” In other words, the message engraved on the medallion is meant to be quick shorthand only, detailing the most crucial information when you cannot speak for yourself. But it also identifies a means by which clinicians and EMTs can rapidly find whatever information you decide they might need to provide you with appropriate care according to your wishes. A list of services is provided here, on the MedicAlert website: My MedicAlert Services To initiate MedicAlert, one needs to purchase a bracelet or necklace. There are many more styles available than ever, and on Susan’s post, you can find links to other sources of more fashionable versions. Generally, an initial bracelet with a year of services can cost as little as $24.99, and after the first year, the services can be renewed for $19.99 a year. You can find complete information on the MedicAlert Foundation website, at MedicAlert.org. Emergency Alert Services: When You’re At Home “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up.” In homecare, this now-iconic phrase is no joke. Every year, up to a third of adults over age 65 will suffer a fall, for all kinds of reasons. And older people are not the only people who fall or find themselves having a sudden health crisis. “I think I might be having a stroke,” “I can’t breathe,” and “I think I’m having a heart attack” comprise many a health crisis. Many of the people having a health emergency will be at home alone at the time. Many of them will have a cellphone that is nowhere near them, and can’t be readily found when they most need it. When we admit a new patient to home health services, we provide them with printed information about personal emergency alert services. Basically, this is a service that provides a communicator that is hooked up to a landline phone, along with a button that you wear. If you are having a crisis, you press the button, which automatically communicates with a response center. They will respond immediately and try to talk to you though the communicator speaker to determine the nature of your crisis and initiate the emergency services you might need. But if you cannot respond, they will automatically initiate those services that you specify when you sign up, such as notifying emergency services and friends or family members who can come to assist you. Probably the best known provider of this service is Phillips Lifeline. Standard monthly services usually cost $30 per month, and an auto-alert service that is automatically triggered by a fall costs $45 per month. There may be discounts available for these services through local home health agencies or other elder service agencies. Emergency Alert Services: No Matter Where You Are Perhaps the most helpful advance in emergency alert services has been the variety of devices, apps and services now available for mobile alerts that can be activated wherever you are. Phillips offers a Response App for your smart phone for $13.95 per month which does not require a long-term contract. They also offer a service called GoSafe which provides alert services anywhere you are if you don’t have a smart phone. One of the most interesting developments in this realm has been the development of ‘smart jewelry.’ An article by Charlie Stevens for PFSK, about Artemis Smart Jewelry, describes how one company is taking emergency alert services to another level. Marketed primarily to women of all ages, a company called Sense6 Design is working on a comprehensive emergency service called Artemis that they plan to have ready by the end of 2015. The service works with your smartphone by means of a clip or a pendant that you can tap in any kind of emergency — health, assault, fire or other kinds. The rechargeable communicator in the clip or pendant “uses a wireless connection with your smart phone to send an emergency transmission to our private security agency which is available 24/7.[…]The security operator uses live audio from your necklace, coupled with GPS data and your personal profile to determine whether to contact police, fire or medical staff to help you [and] simultaneously sends a text message to your choice of loved ones with your current location and a request for help.” The cost of a pendant starts at $49, and various emergency service plans cost from $1/month to text or email three friends, to $19/month for the full security service described above. By December, 2015, they plan to have this service fully functional for people who have an iPhone 4 or later, and by mid-2016 for those with Android smart phones. Further information can also be obtained at the main website for Artemis smart jewelry at Artemis by Sense 6 Design. Other start-ups working on similar smart jewelry include Cuff and First Sign Technologies, summarized with Sense6 Design in this article in WearableWorldNews, published in February of 2014. Cuff is offering smart bracelets that will include Fitbit-style health and activity tracking and text/call notification, along with emergency notification. First Sign Technologies offer a variety of products, including hairclips and pod devices attached to your keys, paired with services similar to to those offered by Smart6 Design’s Artemis products. Device options allow you to choose either an assault alert or a fall alert option, but apparently not both at once. First Sign’s services are geared primarily to providing personal security in the event of a violent crime, even detering attackers by emitting an alarm, collecting and storing audio and video evidence for police and responders, along with contacting emergency services. The security service that will work with one of their products costs as little as $5/month and works like that offered by Artemis, as a smart phone app that will operate with Apple iOS 4.3 or later and Google Android 2.1 or later. The communicator pod in your hairclip or keychain tag will contact a security operator who will be able to communicate with you, gather real-time information about your emergency, including your GPS location, and notify the appropriate responders. I could not find a clear target date on their site for when their full services will be on board, but the article posted on the WearableWorldNews site stated that First Sign was already well on their way to funding their services as of a year ago, and their site suggests that their services are operational now. An Ounce of Prevention… I have to admit to feeling like this is the most dire post I’ve written so far, and that it makes me want to get in bed with my cat and pull the covers over my head. However, as anyone who’s ever been diagnosed with cancer knows all too well, shit happens, and there’s nothing wrong with providing ourselves with some useful assistance in case more shit happens in the future. It may require us to wear a little more jewelry, but it’s a crazy world, my friends. Stay safe, okay?

184,26,23,12,11,2014,2014-11-12,"Published at: 01:11 pm - November 12, 2014 The graphic above links to an article by David A. Fahrenthold, published in The Washington Post a few months ago about a particular Medicare scam involving power wheelchairs that has gone on for years. Scammers made millions of dollars by employing the following strategies. First, they were able to get lists of stolen Medicare ID numbers or pay someone to round up patient names. Then, they were able to buy copies of doctors’ signatures or use the signatures of deceased doctors. They filed false claims for these chairs, because the profit margin was potentially huge. And they counted on the fact that Medicare cannot check every single one of the over four million claims it gets every day. The Justice Department has begun to prosecute these particular scammers, but there is always some other type of equipment or medical supply that scammers can use to file fake claims and make beaucoup bucks. Recently, I became aware of yet another one of these apparent scams. I got a message from the doctor of one of my patients, asking me to provide a limb measurement for a splint so that the doctor could fill it in on the form she got, sign it, and send it off to complete the order. Thankfully, my employer has trained me well as far as patient documentation goes, and I’ve had a great deal of experience over the years filling out forms to justify the need for patients to obtain medical equipment. In this case, I knew, for example, that there was no diagnosis in the patient’s chart that related to this splint. You can’t buy supplies or equipment without a diagnosis that pertains, so I started by asking my patient about it. Neither my patient nor my patient’s family knew anything about any new diagnosis that would warrant a splint. But her family reported that my patient had lately received a number of phone calls offering ‘free’ medical equipment. After catching one of these callers in the act, they had concluded they had been made by telemarketing companies. Just to be thorough, I then assessed the limb in question, with ambiguous results. Next, I called the doctor. Turns out that the order had not originated with her at all. She had received this order form at her office, which stated that the patient had requested the item to relieve a set of symptoms in this particular limb. The form bore the name of a generic, but plausible-sounding medical supply company and looked legitimate. I told her that the patient and the family knew nothing about this, and described the patient’s inconclusive symptoms. Finally, the doctor and I concluded that this was an attempt at fraud. The doctor also told me that their practice had received similar fraudulent orders before. She planned to report the company to Medicare. The world is full of asshats, people, and they seem to have an endless supply of imagination when it comes to scamming our neighbors, our elderly parents, our disabled family members, or even ourselves, especially if we have experienced any significant health issues. Or even if we haven’t. Sometimes, all it takes is our phone number, and the illegally purloined knowledge of what insurance company we do business with, to be the potential victim of a fraud. A web search for fraud involving medical equipment and supplies yielded pages of results. Among them were these: The recent arrest made by the U.S. Justice Department of the owner of a durable medical equipment company which filed 24 million dollars in fraudulent Medicare claims for items including wound care supplies. The August, 2014 article mentioned above published in The Washington Post. This list of Healthcare Fraud Investigations for 2014 posted by the IRS. An article by Dr. Yul Ejnes of the American College of Physicians that was published by KevinMD about scams involving knee braces, diabetic supplies and other items. To fight back, here are a few links about how to recognize this crap and how to report it: StopMedicareFraud.gov. Self-explanatory. The Hotline for The Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to report Medicaid fraud. And the fraud reporting section for Blue Cross Blue Shield. It’s also a good idea to make sure your phone numbers are current and listed with the National Do Not Call Registry. For more information about how the Registry works, and how to file a complaint, visit the Federal Trade Commission site. Finally, you might want to talk to your doctors. And question everything. With a little less diligence, both I and the doctor I talked to this morning could have been hoodwinked into ordering something our patient didn’t need. The item in question is relatively small, commonly used, and doesn’t cost that much in the scheme of things. But if enough false claims were filed for this item by scammers, the profits could be considerable. And the doctor and I would have been unwittingly involved. It sure pays to be skeptical.

185,26,24,9,11,2014,2014-11-09,"Published at: 10:11 am - November 09, 2014 Ray & Tom Magliozzi The Good News Garage About thirty-two years ago, I decided I needed to find a reliable auto mechanic. I was still in my twenties, but I had finally gotten tired of relying on my dad and his local mechanics out in the ‘burbs to service my car. I was by then a card-carrying citizen of the city of Boston, in a neighborhood called Jamaica Plain. I worked across the Charles River in Cambridge, at MIT. Much of the time, I took the subway to work. Across the street from my apartment, I’d hop on the T at Forest Hills Station on the Orange Line, take it to Downtown Crossing, switch to the Red Line, ride to Kendall Square, and walk to 77 Massachusetts Avenue. There I would enter the huge, iconic main building of the MIT campus, and stroll down the infinite corridor to my first-floor office in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where I was a secretary to a small group of faculty members. New England weather being what it is, however, I found myself driving to work more often. And when I drove, I listened to the radio, often tuning to WBUR, a radio station housed at the campus of my previous employer, Boston University, and one of the two NPR stations in the city. On Saturdays, WBUR broadcast this local, call-in radio show called Car Talk, moderated by a pair of MIT grads who were brothers and who happened to run a garage near their alma mater. Inevitably, my poor, tired old Toyota Corolla needed another oil change, and maybe a prayer or two, so I decided to take it to the Good News Garage and see if these dudes were as helpful in person as they were on the radio. My first visit was straight-forward enough. I was greeted by Tom, who looked much as he did in the photo above, sort of an aging hippie type dressed in oil-stained work clothes. I knew from the show that he was a wise-ass. But though he took down my info with a certain wry efficiency, he was mostly all business that morning, and told me to come back after work, and to ask for Ray if he wasn’t there. This was back in the early eighties, when my musical tastes ran to the Pretenders, the Clash, the Ramones, Elvis Costello, and some former, local RISD art students known as the Talking Heads. My hair was asymmetrical, clipped close to my head on one side, with a longish sweep on the other. I was known to wear a small, red, enameled safety pin in one ear. I was not known to wear tasteful business suits to work with sensible pumps. My MIT office was across the hall from a materials science facility identified as the “Creep Testing Laboratory,” the source of much sniggering humor among myself and the several graduate students who wandered into my office, looking for a professor. While my car spent the day at the garage, I passed what was no doubt a typical eight hours, generally consisting of typing up arcane research reports or grant applications. Our department didn’t run to the new, dedicated word-processors that had recently come on the market, so I had to type on an IBM Correcting Selectric typewriter. Which was okay, except that I had to keep switching out the element ball to a Greek character one, so I could fill in the correct symbols for the calculus equations that were often liberally sprinkled throughout these documents. One of the professors wasn’t too careful about proofing his equations. Since I’d had a year of getting A’s in calculus in my thus-far unfinished college career, I used to correct them, thinking that I should get some kind of bonus for having such a skill, which was certainly not in my job description. Eventually, I wandered back to the Good News Garage to pick up my car. Tom wasn’t around, so I was greeted by Ray. “Well,” he said, “we changed the oil. But you might want to think about getting a new car in the not-too-distant future.” “Why? What’s wrong with it?” I asked. Ray seemed to have to ponder this question carefully before answering. “Let me put it this way,” he finally said. “Your car is a piece of crap.” It was only a car, after all, but still, my feelings were a little hurt. I swallowed, took a deep breath, and said, “Well, can you fix it?” “We can probably keep it running for a while. But you are rapidly approaching that point where spending any significant cash on this thing will just be throwing good money after bad.” “Shit,” I said. “I can’t afford a new car.” “Where do you work?” he asked. “At MIT.” “Figures. Where do you live?” “In Jamaica Plain.” “Oh, good!” he said. “My advice is, take the T and start saving up.” I drove home that day in a state of mild despair and not a little irritation at Ray’s bluntness. Still, I did let the Car Guys keep my car going for a while, but was ultimately forced to take their advice and junk the thing for a newer model. I also finally finished my bachelor’s degree, got a new job, and had to find a new mechanic closer to that job. I called the show a few years later, looking forward to reminding Ray of how he insulted my old car, and to reminding Tom that I spelled ‘Kathi’ with a ‘K’ and an ‘I.’ I got accepted into the call queue, but I didn’t end up getting on the air. After that, I used to run into them occasionally. By then, their show had been picked up by NPR, which increased their celebrity status. They often served as MC’s for some of the local concerts and events I attended, like the fundraiser for the non-profit Passim’s Coffee House, held at the Somerville Theatre. The program featured several musicians who had played at Passim’s, including the then not-yet-famous Shawn Colvin, who played a poignant, acoustic version of a Talking Heads song that eventually made it onto one of her later albums. The song was called “This Must Be the Place,” but most of us just referred to it as “Home.” Which brings me to a fitting way to end this remembrance. Tom and Ray may have come to be loved and enjoyed internationally once Car Talk made it onto the NPR program list, even earning a Peabody Award in 1992. But to us natives of metropolitan Boston or of Cambridge (“Our fair city,” as Ray & Tom called it), the Magliozzi Brothers have been always and ever our local boys. As MIT alums, their fame earned them an invitation to deliver the 1999 MIT commencement address. But long before that, they brought their sterling credentials and intelligence to a blue-collar profession that has come more and more to need the likes of MIT grads to do it properly. They came from an essentially urban, ethnic background, like so many of us, whose parents wanted us all to make something of ourselves. Their particular brand of smart-ass but affectionate humor is as familiar to us as Fenway Park, because our families had it, too. Consequently, listening to Tom’s laughter and errant silliness over the years has always been like coming home. Tommy, I know I speak for a lot of your original, long-time fans and friends when I say that we’ll miss you like a brother. ~ ~ ~ Tom Magliozzi died on November 3, 2014 at the age of 77 of complications related to Alzheimer’s disease.

189,26,28,21,6,2014,2014-06-21,"Published at: 06:06 pm - June 21, 2014 This is sixty? I’ve been sixty for about ten weeks now, and I still don’t know what I think of it. For the past ten years, I’ve been steadfastly tossing membership invitations from the AARP in the shredder. Wouldn’t be strictly accurate for me to join. The initials, after all, originally stood for the American Association of Retired Persons. And I’m not a retired person. Not yet. Mine is the generation whose members are mostly unable to afford to retire as soon as we might wish to. We might live for 2, 3 or even 4 more decades yet, heaven help us. We occupy the Sandwich Generation. Some of us are still helping our kids pay off college loans while looking after elderly parents who can’t live alone any longer. We tend to be over-mortgaged and under-pensioned. Some of us try to retire and then have to return to work because we have trouble making ends meet, even with Social Security. It’s not pretty. But it’s not all dire either. After all, a lot has changed since my mother was my age. She would never, for instance, have gotten a tattoo for her 55th birthday, or for any birthday in fact. I recall that menopause seemed to hit her a lot harder than it hit me. She hated the insomnia. When I had insomnia, I’d just get up and teach myself a few more tricks in Photoshop. When her back started bothering her, my mom took yoga classes. Me, I took tango and salsa lessons. I would take three one-hour classes in a row on Friday nights, Beginning Tango followed by Beginning & Intermediate Salsa. One night, a tall, rangy lad in Salsa II was sharing a new double twirl move he’d figured out in a Salsa club. I’d been getting twirled for two-and-a-half hours by then, but I practiced the double-twirl with him till I had it down. And then suddenly had to sit down and remain very, very still for several minutes so I wouldn’t hurl. It was a fantastic evening. A few weeks ago, I noticed that my kneecaps have started making a funny, crunchy noise when I bend them. We physical therapists have a word for this noise. We call it crepitus. The word is as hideous as the sound it makes, but it’s not necessarily the end of the world. Not yet. I can still get up from a full squat, but sometimes it does hurt a little. With an air of wry tragedy, however, I called one of the local orthopods I know and left a message for his secretary to book me an appointment. Meanwhile, I’ve given myself a physical therapy regimen — strengthening and stretching exercises. I’d like to have an X-ray so I can see if there’s anything ugly going on in there so far. Just to have a little advanced warning, you know. Forewarned is forearmed and all that. For years, one of my bellwethers has been Rene Russo. Rene and I were born in the same year, although she turned sixty about seven weeks before I did. I’ve always liked her attitude. She was 45 when she starred with Pierce Brosnan in ‘The Thomas Crown Affair.’ I found it encouraging at the time that another middle-aged white chick with longish, reddish-brown hair could still be such a hottie. This photo of her was apparently taken when she was 59. I notice that, like me, she’s added some blond highlights to her hair coloring. Helps hide the gray roots better. She’s got those neck lines like I have, and that extra half-chin when she smiles, and crow’s feet. Still, she looks wonderful. And normal. And human. Rumor has it that she’s had a little facial plastic surgery, but that hasn’t been confirmed. Judging by the absence of vertical lines between her eyebrows, it may be true that she’s had a little botox and some laser work. No matter, though. I have no doubt that the back of Rene Russo’s arms start to look like wadded up crepe paper if she goes without moisturizer for a day. Some things are just unavoidable. I’m not likely to resort to botox, but I bleach some of my sun spots. And if I slather on enough baby oil, that crepe paper thing goes away. You do what you can. One interesting thing I’ve noticed is that I’ve suddenly decided that I have too much stuff. Well, except maybe books and music. And since they can, if one prefers, be had in e-form, and thus don’t need extra shelf space, technically, they don’t count as ‘stuff.’ No, I mean everything else. Clothes, picture frames, gewgaws, dishes, furniture. Even power tools. I just have too much stuff. I’ve spent much of this year unloading as much of it as I can. The Big Sisters are quite fond of me these days. My neighbors look forward to what I’m going to leave at the end of my driveway. Speaking of clothes, I have begun to hear myself asking a truly ghastly question as I sort through my drawers and closets. That question is: ‘Am I too old to wear this now?’ Dear gawd. This is applied to everything from certain hemlines to tank tops to anything that is too clingy. The bikinis got tossed decades ago. But there’s a lot of stuff that’s hung around, waiting for me to decide if a certain item makes me look extremely fortunate or like a damned idiot. I’ve kept my tight jeans and my red high heels. I’m not so sure about that paisley, halter, mini-dress. In the meantime, to get down to what truly matters, I’m very grateful to have known so many kind, lovely, funny, intelligent, creative people over the years. And I do want to thank those of you who’ve hung in there with me through any portion of the past sixty years, especially the last five or six since the you-know-what suckage. I very much appreciate those of you who still genuinely care about me, and who don’t get on my nerves, and who employ decent grammar, and who aren’t ill-informed gits who get their health advice from people like Dr. Oz. Oh, I kept all my lipstick, by the way. So, a big mwah from me. I’ll let you know when I get around to throwing the party.

192,26,30,21,12,2013,2013-12-21,"Published at: 04:12 pm - December 21, 2013 In many ways, my mom and dad were very brave, remarkably tolerant parents, bless them. For instance, perhaps against all common sense, I was allowed to learn how to cook, by myself, by the age of seven. It wasn’t Cordon Bleu cuisine, but I could manage quite edible scrambled eggs, bacon, French toast, and even pancakes without burning down the house. The deal was that I could mess up the kitchen as much as I found necessary, but I had to clean it up afterwards. At the age of ten, I decided it was time to try something more complicated, something that involved chocolate, something ‘from scratch’ — that exciting phrase that meant a cook had truly arrived. Cupcakes from mixes and instant pudding from boxes no longer satisfied my ambitions. Somewhat unwisely, I chose to try an old recipe that my great-aunt May had cut out of a newspaper decades earlier for chocolate meringue pie. No instant anything. A single pie crust was involved, which of course stuck to my hands, but managed to fit the pie pan nonetheless. I also had to learn to separate eggs. The egg yolks went into the chocolate pudding, along with the melted baking chocolate. The whites went into the meringue. I liked the culinary balance of that. It seemed at the time that cooking chocolate pudding from scratch took an eternity of stirring over a hot stove, but I pressed onward, and magically, about a year later, the pudding thickened. The final results — rich, dark, melt-in-your-mouth pudding, topped with fluffy clouds of meringue, perched in a flaky, albeit uneven, crust — were a revelation. Subsequently, I could only sneer at boxes of Jello instant pudding and store-bought pie. There was no turning back. By the age of thirteen, I was an old hand in the kitchen. And that grand opportunity for culinary excess, Christmas, was around the corner. I found an ad in a magazine for a lovely set of copper Christmas cookie cutters, with a recipe book for various options, including decorated roll-and-cut sugar cookies, plus a set of frosting tips and a pastry bag for decorating them. I sent in a money order, and about three weeks before Christmas, my package arrived. The cookie cutter shapes were supposed to represent an international theme, with designs from various European countries. That added to their cachet, in my opinion. No snowmen or bells or wreaths or even Santa shapes. Instead, a reindeer for Finland, a fleur-de-lis for France, a windmill for Holland. I’ve forgotten what countries the other shapes were supposed to represent, but one can make some educated guesses. The following I decided to try everything out. Wisely, my mother decided this would be a good time to get out of the house and do some grocery shopping. The cookie recipe stated that the yield was for 2 to 3 dozen cookies, which hardly seemed enough, so I doubled it. Later, it occurred to me that perhaps the yield prediction was based on using much larger cookie cutters. In any case, I proceeded to assemble my ingredients. I was reasonably organized about it, and since the cookies only took about 7 minutes to bake, I had quite a production line going along the kitchen counter, with a rolling and cutting area, a baking sheet area, and a cooling rack area. Very soon, I ran out of counter space, so I began to move racks of cooling cookies to the dining room table. Six or ten racks later, the dining table was full, so I placed the last few dozen cookies to cool on the credenza in the living room. I’m not sure how it happened, but some sort of biblical miracle appeared to have taken place, and I ended up far exceeding the expected cookie yield. By the time my mother arrived home from shopping, there were 12 dozen cookies cooling all over the house. With a full brown paper grocery bag in each arm, my mother shoved her way through the back door and into the kitchen. Not unlike Mary and Joseph, seeking accommodations in Bethlehem, she surveyed the kitchen counter and realized there was no room at the inn. She was not overly alarmed at that point, and deftly took a right turn into the dining room. And halted. I still endeavored to be a considerate child then, and rushed to her side to wrestle a grocery bag from her arm. “Um, I, um, ended up with a lot more cookies than I thought I would,” I said, somewhat unnecessarily. My mother remained speechless for a very long minute, while several emotions played over her face. We made our way into the living room, where my mother looked at the credenza, then at me, then back at the dining table, then at the grocery bags, and back at me again. I’m fairly certain of the gist of the conflicting thoughts running through her mind at that moment. They were not new thoughts. One of them was, “I should be used to the way her projects take over the house by now.” Another was, “Well, I’ve got to hand it to her, she’s ambitious.” Still another was, “I don’t know where she gets it from. She doesn’t take after me.” The final amalgam of these thoughts produced an expression of bemused resignation. I’d seen this look many times. As usual, I didn’t know whether to apologize or grin. “I’ll just clear some of the cookies off the dining table,” I offered. “They should be cooled by now.” “Oh, never mind. We can just put the bags on the dining chairs,” she said. “You don’t have cookies on the chairs, do you?” “Uh, no.” “Well, that’s a relief. Here, take this bag and put the milk in the refrigerator.” Eventually, the groceries got put away, and the cookies got carefully arranged in layers on a couple of large trays, between sheets of waxed paper. Naturally, I had to clean up the kitchen, which took some considerable labor, and we had to eat dinner that night. So, I thought it wise to postpone the decorating portion of the program until Sunday afternoon. Decorating 12 dozen cookies turned out to be less entertaining than I thought it would. At first, it was splendidly fun whipping up butter cream frosting, separating it into little bowls, dyeing it different colors, and trying out all the decorative frosting tips. Tucked in amongst this array, spread across the entire dining table, were little containers of cinnamon hearts, colored sugar crystals, and chocolate jimmies. Each cookie, like an art canvas, required a gesso foundation of plain frosting, onto which I applied various realistic details. My mother strolled through the dining room from time to time, glancing at my progress. “How much butter and sugar have you gone through?” she asked at one point. “Uh, I think maybe a couple of pounds,” I said. “Of each!?” “Yeah, I think so.” “Well, I hope you realize this is coming out of your allowance.” I managed to decorate about six dozen cookies, with judicious breaks for tasting them, before my hands started to cramp up. I took another break and ate a few more cookies — they were delicious, I admit — but my will and imagination were faltering. I had to throw in the towel for a few days. It took about another week to finish decorating them all. I had to give up on the notion of artistic purity, and convinced a few of my girlfriends to help me out after school. At first, they were delighted at the prospect, but I discovered that their enthusiasm wavered much more quickly than mine, after perhaps a dozen or so cookies. I won’t say that I came to hate Christmas cookies. They were my creation, after all. But by the last dozen or three, my girlfriends and I lapsed into making rude jokes about them. And admittedly, those final cookies were not the creative masterpieces they might have been. I also discovered that there was a limited number of potential cookie recipients in my immediate circle of friends and family. No one really wanted more than a dozen or two. Between snacking and gifting, I managed to dispatch about six or eight dozen of them. I was so tired of them all by then that I didn’t want to keep any more of them myself, a decision with which my mother heartily concurred. In the end, about a week before Christmas, my father drove me and the final four dozen cookies to the local hospital, where they were accepted perhaps more enthusiastically than the fruitcakes, fudge, and pies that other festively-minded citizens had already pressed upon the staff. “We’ll bring these to the children’s ward,” one of the nurses assured me. “Kids don’t really like fruitcake.” Posted in: Play by Kathi 25 Comments childhood, Christmas, cookies, Holidays",0,1,0.1164139105339105
196,26,34,3,8,2013,2013-08-03,"Published at: 01:08 pm - August 03, 2013 Sunlight is not enough. It’s that time of year when I endure my run of doctor visits, lab tests and diagnostic imaging, hoping that once again, NED will be my companion when they’re all done. I just picked up a copy of three pages of lab results, all good, and one of them prompted me to dash off a quick post. Research into Vitamin D has been prolific in recent years, with results that have implications for many of us. Vitamin D helps us absorb calcium and other bone-building nutrients. Inadequate Vitamin D forces the body to steal calcium from bones and thus increases our risk of fractures and osteoporosis. The most readily available source of D is from sun exposure, but weather, geographic latitude and the risk of skin cancer all limit how much we can get from the sun. Some studies have confirmed the fact that many if not most of us in North America do not get enough D, because adequate sunshine is just not available. A cogent summary published by Harvard Health reports on these findings. Not only can we not get enough D from sun exposure, but the old minimum daily requirement of 400 IUs daily is inadequate. Most of us may need at least 1,000 IUs daily to keep our bones healthy. More than just bone health. Bone health is crucial for all of us, but it’s not the only reason we need adequate D. According to the Harvard piece, “it’s active in many tissues and cells besides bone and controls an enormous number of genes, including some associated with cancers, autoimmune disease, and infection. Hardly a month goes by without news about the risks of vitamin D deficiency or about a potential role for the vitamin in warding off diseases, including breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, and even schizophrenia.” Multiple studies, summarized in the International Journal of Health Studies, have reported an association between deficient D and a higher risk for developing “obesity, diabetes, hypertension, depression, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoporosis and neuro-degenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. Vitamin D deficiency may even contribute to the development of cancers, especially breast, prostate, and colon cancers.” Even in the Middle East, where inadequate sun ought not to be a factor, studies have found significant D deficiencies among men and women. Several studies in particular have demonstrated an association between low D and increased risk of breast cancer, particularly in premenopausal women. It was the combination of reading these studies on breast cancer as they began to emerge a few years ago and my mother’s osteoporosis, causing severe spinal deformity that eventually contributed to her death, that prompted me to start taking 1,000 IUs of D3 a day. After six months of this self-imposed regimen, I asked my primary care doc to test my vitamin D level, accomplished by a simple blood test, and was astonished to find that my D was still below normal. I immediately increased it, and now take 20,000 IUs of D3 a week, in the form of readily available D3 gel capsules, which gives me about 2,800 IUs a day. It’s important to take D supplements in the right form. D3 is the one that is most readily absorbable. The good thing about D is that, because it is fat soluble and thus stored in the body, you have the option of taking it daily or weekly, as you prefer. I have been taking my weekly dose for about 3 years now. Results. After about 4 months of taking this much D, I noticed that my lifelong struggle with recurring depression abated. For the first time in many years, I no longer had to take an SSRI, and have not had to take one since. Amazing. And without taking calcium supplements, my next bone density scan showed a slight improvement in my bone density. Also amazing. For women who take aromatase inhibitors, which notoriously can wreak havoc on bone density, having your blood Vitamin D levels checked is crucial. Your doctor should also check your blood calcium level. You need to have enough of both, and infrequently, D supplementation may cause a higher than normal level of calcium, and require you to adjust your supplement level. A normal blood level of D is somewhere between 30 and 100 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), and researchers have recommended aiming for a level between 40 and 60 ng/mL. A normal calcium level is between 8.9 and 10.3 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). A review of research on D and breast cancer prevention was published recently in PlosOne.org. This review study found that D’s role in preventing breast cancer for postmenopausal women was inconclusive, but did find that better results were found when D was taken in higher doses and taken with calcium. It also suggests that studies currently underway may yield clearer results. Research does, however, suggest that D supplementation can mitigate bone loss caused by aromatase inhibitors. And a recent review study reported that, among several different options, D supplements were the one option that did help decrease joint pain among women taking AI’s. My own labs this year are instructive. I wondered if perhaps my 20K IUs of D3 a week would now be shown to be too much. But my recent lab results showed that my D was nicely in the middle of normal range, as was my calcium. So, I’ll stick to my current dosage. Now, I just have to get that damn mammogram in a few weeks… Posted in: Health & Healthcare, Research by Kathi 23 Comments aromatase inhibitors, bone health, Osteoporosis, Vitamin D",0,1,0.15438815060908084
197,26,35,28,7,2013,2013-07-28,"Published at: 06:07 pm - July 28, 2013 “Your biopsy is positive.” None of us ever forgets when we first heard some version of that phrase. I heard it five years ago today. And I thought it merited my emerging briefly from my blog hiatus to write a post. Two weeks ago, I saw my primary care doc for my annual physical. Last week, I had a bunch of lab tests, all good. Next week, I’ll be confirming the date of my next mammogram. Then I’ll be going to get it. And biting my nails till I get the results. A few weeks after that, I’ll be seeing my one remaining cancer doc, my surgeon. And hoping we’ll be discussing negative results again and not discussing the need for further tests. NED, I’m waiting on you. What hasn’t changed. I still have to be vigilant. I know too much to think that five years of NED means I’m off the hook. I’m still tired. I still find it hard to concentrate. I still have days when I just have to give up and give in and do nothing. I still can’t work full time. I still have pain and problems every day with my right side, my right shoulder, arm, elbow, and wrist. I still have to be careful not to lean over and reach too quickly, so I don’t set off a massive muscle spasm from my right collarbone, through my chest, and down to my waist. The main cause is radiation, which left in its wake a lot of permanent soft tissue damage five years ago this October. My house still looks more like an archeological dig than a home. The livingroom and the kitchen and the bathroom are mostly habitable. There are piles of things in other rooms, some in bags, some freeform. My bed looks like a bed, and I manage to keep clean sheets on it. The cats like it. The laundry is never caught up, but the cats like that, too. The main thing is that I still have a home. And the plumbing works. And the roof doesn’t leak. I have managed to mow the front yard more or less regularly this year. The back yard hasn’t been mowed all summer. There’s a fence around it, a high fence, which is good. Keeps out the larger species of wildlife, and hides my benign neglect from the neighbors. And now there are some wildflowers growing in it, things like black-eyed Susans and wild asters and Queen Anne’s lace, poking in around the false indigo and spirea and hostas and columbines I planted before I had cancer. It’s become something of a small meadow. Rather pleasant. The bees and butterflies like it. At some point, I’ll tidy it up. Just not today. Maybe not this summer. Thanks to e-banking, most of my bills get paid on time. And I still get a paycheck. And I still have health insurance. And I still have my job, the same job I had when I was diagnosed. I’ve had to adjust and decrease my hours around cancer’s viscissitudes over the years, but nobody seems to mind very much except me. What also hasn’t changed is that I’ve lost friends to breast and other cancers. And old friends continue to be newly diagnosed with mets. And most of my cyber friends are friends who’ve been diagnosed with cancer. And I hate doctors appointments. And I guarantee that I will still have the heebee geebies when I go for my next mammogram. What has changed. My social life is a lot more circumscribed. I’m not as spontaneous as I used to be. But I cherish the friends who’ve stayed the course even more. Making Art with a capital A has taken a decided nose dive in the last few years. I still make art with a small ‘a’ now and then. Art with a capital A requires more energy and money and resources than I have these days. I’m not worried though. I’ve been at it long enough to know that the river hasn’t dried up. It’s still there, whenever I’m ready to dive in again. My life has slowed down. Dramatically. And I’ve had to let go of a lot. Of necessity. I haven’t liked it much. Some of the letting go has been painful — like letting go of friendships and expectations. But I don’t feel as angry and resentful about it all. My attitude has changed this year, for the better, I think. I seem finally to have come to some genuine acceptance of where I’m at and how I got here. Doesn’t mean I won’t try to change and improve things. But I’ve learned to make small goals, teeny goals, short-term goals, and not to get as discouraged as I used to if I don’t meet them. I’ve learned to stop comparing Now with Then as much as I used to do. Huge, that one. Now is now. That’s all I can deal with. Then is in the past. Tomorrow could change on a dime. I know that very well. And if it does, tomorrow is when I’ll deal with it. What I’ve learned. Aside from feeling like I now have an advanced degree in oncology, I’ve learned that I can’t fix everything. In fact, I can’t fix most things. I’ve also learned that it’s much easier to do one thing at a time. And that multi-tasking really is a myth, because I can’t really pay attention to more than one thing at a time. Because paying attention at all is often a challenge. And that finishing small things feels just as good as finishing big things. And that the way to finish big things is to subdivide them into small things. I’ve learned to be much more forgiving. I’ve learned that I have to forgive myself and others and the ups and downs of life, sometimes on an almost constant basis. I’ve learned to expect to forgive, that it’s healthy to forgive, that it eliminates a lot of needless disappointment to develop the habit of forgiving. It doesn’t mean becoming a doormat or a passive, unfeeling lump. It doesn’t mean putting on blinders to what is wrong or cruel in this world. But it does mean learning to step back from what may feel unforgivable. And it means I’ve learned to pick my battles. I’ll fight the ones I need to fight, but I don’t have to fight them all. I get to help people for a living. Often that means I get to advocate for them. And when I do, sometimes I get things to change for the better. It’s a lot easier to do that for one person at time, and often, it’s a lot more meaningful, too. It helps that I never said ‘why me?’ when I was diagnosed. When you work as a healthcare clinician, you get over that very quickly. Catastrophe happens, unbidden, undeserved, all the time. I hate that I was diagnosed with cancer, but I never took it personally. I’ve learned to value my passion and skepticism, but to spend them more wisely. After spending so many months and years feeling not okay, indeed feeling the very opposite of okay, it’s great now to feel just okay. In fact, it’s brilliant. I don’t have to feel spectacular to laugh and love and play and help someone. And when I do, I often end up feeling a lot better than okay. Here’s to the next five years.

199,26,37,12,3,2013,2013-03-12,"Published at: 04:03 pm - March 12, 2013 Euclid drawing a theorem construction. When I was fourteen, I discovered a great affinity for plane geometry, developed largely by Euclid, the Father of Geometry, who gave birth to his theorems and axioms around 300 B.C. I was adjusting to the ravages of puberty at the time, and therefore struggling with my personal geometry. This included a growth spurt right before I entered the 9th grade, during which I grew in height by 5″ within four months, and after which I resembled nothing so much as a stick figure made of several pipe-cleaners. Abandoning any hope of looking voluptuous, I settled instead for my math teacher’s quiet approbation, and frankly enjoyed being one of the few members of our class who was fascinated by the constructions she drew on the blackboard, not unlike what Euclid himself seems to be doing in this painting. A few years later, our class took an extensive aptitude test that included several categories of skill, like verbal and mechanical, along with other more arcane abilities. I ended up scoring 100 in a category called ‘spatial relations,’ which is one of those tests where you have to determine what a 2D figure would look like were it glued together to make a 3D figure. And vice versa. This is a skill that comes in handy for future architects, engineers and physical therapists (who may as well call ourselves biomechanical engineers), although at the time, I had little intention of pursuing any of those professions. The first two vocations were mentioned to me somewhat half-heartedly by our (male) high school guidance counselor, but the last one was never brought up at all. Had it been, I may have trundled down the road that led to my eventual career a decade or so earlier than I did. But this was all taking place around 1970, and the guidance counselor didn’t really know what to do with me. Girl architects and engineers were not exactly thick on the ground back then. An Exploratory Childhood I can’t really take any credit for my inherent aptitudes. I may as well admit now that my parents were both geniuses. They both had IQ’s well into the triple digits. My mother had the highest IQ in her class. My father was double-promoted twice, and graduated from high school at age fifteen. Not that it did either of them much good career-wise. They were both children in the Depression of 1929, and came from large, poor families, and thus college was far beyond their ken. My mother went to work for the Phone Company. My dad joined the Army during World War II and was trained in electronics. When he was honorably discharged, he also went to work for the Phone Company, where he eventually met my mom. The rest, as they say, is history. Aside from the genetic inheritence, there were a lot of advantages to having frustrated geniuses as parents. For one thing, they were both rather eccentric, mostly in a good way. My mother sewed clothes and slipcovers, wrote extremely clever poetry, admired Emily Dickinson and Eleanor Roosevelt, and joined the Abigail Adams Historical Society, conveniently located down the street from us at Abigail Adams’ birthplace. My father filled our basement with the flotsam and jetsam of his many interests, most of them electronic or chemical in nature. The latter included a photographic darkroom. The former encompassed his considerable audiophilia and enough electronic thing-um-a-bobs to fill a small warehouse. When I was about ten, my father bought a telescope, subsequent to our Sunday excursions to the Hayden Planetarium at the Boston Museum of Science. Bless them both. They never did things by halves. Following their passionate example, I learned that ‘play’ did not merely indicate a good game of kick ball. It meant that I was, for instance, allowed to learn to cook and bake at a young age, with only enough guidance not to harm myself or burn the house down. It meant I was allowed to take apart the spare sewing machine, my grandmother’s old Singer, and figure out how to put it back together so I could make doll clothes. It meant I could sing and bang away on the old spinet piano before supper, when I was learning to read music at school, and my mother did not holler at me to cease my infernal racket. It meant I could make a big mess, as long as I eventually tidied up after myself. It meant I could make mistakes. It meant I had a lot of fun and learned things I didn’t even know I was learning. Drawing by Leonardo da Vinci These and other activities did in fact lead inexorably to 9th grade plane geometry. When you are learning to bake from scratch, you have to follow recipes. If you muck up the fractions and measurements, you end up with burnt, inedible cookies. Then there was the Barbie Dream House I got for my ninth birthday. The house itself and its furniture were made of corrugated cardboard and ‘required some assembly.’ My parents left me to slog through this without assistance. Not only did I manage to fold and insert tab A into slot B over and over, I decided to unfold all the cardboard furniture, trace it on posterboard, draw my own designs, and redecorate. Very instructive, and much more interesting than pretending that Barbie was in a lather about what to wear on her next date with Ken. Then my dad gave me a science kit for Christmas. Among other things, it included a rudimentary microscope (also with ‘some assembly required’) and a crystal growing kit. The chemicals included (chiefly potassium alum) resulted in some very pleasing clear and purple colored geometric shapes, dangling at the end of a string over the saturated solution at the bottom of a glass jar. My dad being my dad, I was allowed to try the same thing with one of his color photography developing chemicals, an interesting substance called potassium ferricyanide, which resulted in a beautiful, ruby-red shape called a rhombohedron, a kind of slanted cube. Somehow or other, I managed to turn all this into some kind of extra-credit science project for school, and got an A. Perhaps the following Christmas, I got a make-your-own kaleidoscope, plus an origami kit. Wow!!! I highly recommend both, for adults and children. They both provided an almost painless way to be creative and learn a great deal about angles, shapes, spacial relations, and light refraction. Science, math AND art! What could be better? Meanwhile, having outgrown dolls by then, I decided to sew clothes for myself. It turned out to be fortunate that my Catholic grammar school education did not include ‘home economics,’ because I turned to a do-it-yourself book from the local library, and learned more, with a bit of guidance from my mother, mostly in the form of the odd box of pins and dressmaker’s chalk. It still mystifies me that so many women who sew, knit, embroider and engage in other myriad craft-making projects consider themselves hopeless at math or geometry, when their hobbies so obviously include the application of calculations, and the magical transformation of 2D materials into 3D results. Take heed, crafty sisters. You know a lot more than you think. Woman Teaching Geometry Calculating Women Small wonder really, that I developed an affinity for plane geometry. During International Women’s Month, I find myself pondering how far we women have come, yet how far we have to go. Remarkably enough, when I was in the 9th grade back in 1968, girls were not ‘allowed’ to take mechanical drawing. This incomprehensible piece of sexism endured despite the fact that girls who demonstrated a passable math aptitude were certainly expected to take math and science classes in my college-prep Catholic high school. Not to mention the fact that mechanical drawing was taught by a nun. And that a few years later, I was, albeit reluctantly, encouraged to consider studying architecture or engineering, two fields that manifestly required one to learn mechanical drawing. At the end of the 9th grade, I discovered that my math teacher, my physical science teacher, and the mechanical drawing teacher, nuns all, apparently launched a protest about this archaic and sexist exclusion, using myself and a few other geeky girl classmates as examples of why it should be abolished. By the time I entered the 10th grade, 9th grade girls were at last able to study mechanical drawing. I missed out on the class, but I managed to go on to study biology, chemistry, physics, algebra and trigonometry, all taught by women. Nothing like striking a blow for feminism, and I didn’t even have to burn my bra. Today, we still need more women in what is called STEM — Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Women and other minorities continue to be underrepresented in these fields, and make less money than their white, male counterparts. Today, as it happens, Ann Hoang has posted links to several articles about this, at the website STEMINIST.com. Even the White House has provided a special page about Women in STEM, with lots of news and fact sheets. Further helpful info can be found here: STEM Education for Girls. I could write several posts about the ramifications of the current political and economic climate, but suffice it to say that when women’s reproductive health continues to be under attack, when research into metastatic cancer is still woefully underfunded, and when access to affordable healthcare is still threatened by further cuts to so-called ‘entitlement’ programs, we need more women in science, technology, research, and medicine to get out there and kick some calculating butt. If you want to raise children, and especially girls, who, like me, end up with a graduate degree in science, I think my parents set a fine example. They let me help them make, take apart, and fix stuff. I was bored sometimes, like when my dad used to make me help him tinker with the car. But as an adult, I learned how to use power tools and can even set up my computer without the aid of a thirteen-year-old. Although I’m sure it was trying at times, my parents were not afraid to let me make a mess. They let me make my own mistakes and figure out where I’d gone wrong. They knew instinctively that exploration is the best kind of play. They read to me, they played games with me, they took me to the library, to concerts and plays, and to museums of every stripe. I didn’t always relish looking at Art with a capital A, but later, I discovered I’d developed an appreciation I didn’t know I had. They also let me make music and art. Research has shown that learning music enhances a child’s understanding of math. And art! I still have fond memories of spending hours with my Crayola 64-pack crayons and a stack of scrap paper. Nowadays, kids can make art and videos out of all kinds of media, including digital. When I was at first baffled by learning to use Adobe Illustrator, I was astonished to figure out that it operated by using vectors and angles. There’s a lot of math in art. And there’s a lot of creativity in science. Look at da Vinci! Perhaps most importantly, my parents knew how to facilitate, not dictate. They’d help me a little, then get out of my way. It struck me as I was writing this that I should dedicate it to the memory of two of my favorite math geeks, Rachel Cheetham Moro and Susan Niebur. So, rock on, girl geeks! And make your mark on the future.

200,26,38,23,2,2013,2013-02-23,"Published at: 03:02 pm - February 23, 2013 One of the reasons I haven’t written as many posts as I’d like is that I spend a lot more time than I used to writing and typing stuff so I can get paid. Four years ago, I was all for it when the homecare agency I work for finally bought us clinicians some laptops and bought the whole agency some documentation software. It involved a massive outlay of money, effort, and training. And that was just the beginning. There were — and still are — the inevitable software bugs, crashes, server inadequacies, updates, errors, and just-plain-mystifying nonsense. There were — and still are — too many time-consuming emails, meetings, seminars, and phone calls needed to fix things. But still, I was psyched. At last, we were moving into the 21st century! At last, we could blast through our visit notes and spend more time actually helping our patients! Boy, was I wrong. For me, there were further, unexpected ramifications. I had just returned to work, after acute cancer treatment was over, when all these changes began taking place. Within months of being back on the job, the long- and late-term side effects of cancer treatment forced me to cut back my hours, from full to part-time. First, I had to cut them in half. Eventually, I clawed my way through the murky side effects ditch back to working four days a week, instead of the five I used to do. However, thanks to our 21st century documentation, I still work five days a week. I just don’t get paid for it. Sometimes, when I’m tightening my belt yet again because it’s hard to pay my bills with one-fifth less income, I think about trying to return to full-time. But I know that if I did, I’d end up working 50 hours a week instead of 40, and I just can’t do that anymore. I’m also very well aware of being fortunate that, despite fatigue, pain, brain fog, financial stress, and the ever-present anxiety of cancer vigilance, I can do my job at all. Ten Dollar Aspirins This past week, Steven Brill wrote a piece for Time called Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us. It has been widely and justifiably shared on social media. The points Brill makes that have stirred perhaps the most outrage and discussion concern the “lopsided pricing and outsize profits” inherent in the system. If you examine an itemized bill for a hospital stay, that includes items like $29 for a few gauze pads that actually cost a nickel a pad, or $10,000 charges for one dose of a chemo drug that may cost the manufacturer $200, it’s hard not to feel like we’re all getting shamelessly gouged. Indeed, when you move into the realm of cancer care, you begin to understand the pressure cooker of spiralling costs to which both doctors and patients contribute. In her memoir, The Cost of Hope, journalist Amanda Bennett poignantly described how much it cost to treat, and ultimately fail to save, her husband from the ravages of kidney cancer. Over the seven years of his care, the motivation to do everything possible led to expensive duplication and redundancy of services. As she researched the details for her book, she found, in just one stunning example, that her husband had received a total of 76 CT scans. Bennet asked, “Were all of them useful and ordered for a good reason? I’m positive of that. Were all of them necessary? I’m just as sure not.” As someone who has a foot in both camps, the patient camp and the clinician camp, what most interested me about Brill’s article was the first part of it, in which he discusses how much it costs to administer healthcare. And why. Medicare, for example, has to be more accountable for every dollar in its budget, and thus manages to spend less than 1 cent of every dollar it pays for actual healthcare delivery on billing and administration. In marked contrast, the average health insurance company — Brill uses the example of Aetna — easily spends 30 cents of every dollar just to process claims and pay its management. And that’s just the payer side. Paperwork or Patient Care? On my side, the provider side, every hour I spend trying to document what I do for my patients means one less hour I can spend actually doing it. And that does not include the hours my administrative colleagues spend, dotting all our i’s and crossing our t’s, so that my employer can satisfy the dozens of different requirements mandated by all the different insurers our patients use, and all their several insurance plans, each with its own set of rules, so that, ultimately, we can get paid to do what we do. A book published a few years ago by the National Institutes of Health, called The Healthcare Imperative: Lowering Costs and Improving Outcomes, describes this insanity in detail. Studies conducted about ten years ago found that administrative costs for delivering care in U.S. hospitals comprised about 27% of their total revenue. For physician practices, the percentage was 24%. The authors describe three main factors contributing to this, dubbed complexity, variation, and friction. From the book: The first is complexity. The insurance process has multiple steps, often demanding precise accuracy and attention to detail. BIR steps [or the activity involved in billing insurance companies] include contracting with insurers and subcontracted providers; maintaining benefits databases; determining patient insurance and cost sharing; collecting copayments, formulary, and prior authorization; coding of services delivered; checking and submitting claims; receiving and depositing payments; appealing denials and underpayments; collecting from patients; negotiating end-of-year resolution of unsettled claims; and paying subcontracted providers. The second burdensome feature of managing insurance is variation. Due to consolidation of insurers in recent decades, a provider practice likely has fewer payers to deal with. However, each payer offers multiple products and often further customizes products to individual purchasers (such as a large employer). Each provider may have to deal with dozens to hundreds of different plans. Providers must track plan-specific benefits and reimbursement rules, maintain special databases and benefit experts, and conduct time-consuming checks of plan details prospectively and in response to claims denials. This situation is in stark contrast to privately administered plans in other developed countries, where there is typically a single primary benefits package. The third feature is friction. Many BIR steps slow and complicate the process of getting paid. These include priority authorizations and formulary restrictions, high rates of nonpayment for initial submissions (10 to 15 percent), underpayments, and ultimate non- and underpayment (5 to 10 percent) (Gans, 2009). Providers express frustration and occasionally a suspicion that the process is kept complicated to lower ultimate payment levels. Yup. Couldn’t have said it better myself. One of the things that was potentially supposed to help fix all this was the advent of electronic medical records. However, now that we have them, I can say, from both of the camps I occupy, that computerized health documentation is very far from living up to its vaunted potential for providing genuine efficiency or cost savings to patients and providers. A study published in Risk Management and Healthcare Policy outlines some of these potential benefits and real drawbacks. One of the obvious problems I see every day is that most of the myriad software systems in place are unable to ‘talk’ to one another. Despite the hours I spend every week typing patient notes in my laptop, I still have to fill out mountains of paper forms, write and send faxes, and make myriad phone calls to find out what I need to know. Last week, just obtaining a copy of the pathology report from my recent colonoscopy required me to make several phone calls, then physically drive to the hospital, and find my way through a labyrinth of corriders to sign a form that would allow a clerk to look up my record and print it out. By all means, let’s keep the pressure on the makers of overpriced diagnostic equipment and drugs, hospitals that charge us five bucks for every 5-cent bandaid, and specialists who charge thousands to perform one procedure, to suck it up and cut their charges. But for heaven’s sake, it seems to me we should look at how much time all of us who deliver healthcare spend NOT delivering healthcare. And why. And how much it’s costing us all.

201,26,39,16,2,2013,2013-02-16,"Published at: 04:02 pm - February 16, 2013 Not Exactly Hearts and Flowers Among cancer tests, colonoscopies are a little odd. I’m not talking about the infamous prep, or even the general indignity involved. I’m talking about the results. If the doctor finds nothing — no polyps, no ulcers, no funny stuff — then, great. You’re in the clear, come back in ten years, see ya later, have a nice life. If the doc finds polyps, which is often the case, he or she will usually try to remove them completely during the colonoscopy. The ones shaped like little pendulums usually get lassoed by a kind of wire snare that cuts them out, stem and all. The flat ones get excised. If they are larger than usual, with a broad attachment area, they may only be biopsied, and may have to be removed by surgery later. In any case, all these bits of tissue get sent to our friend the pathologist, who analyzes them and pronounces them benign. Or not. The good thing about all this is that, if the doctor does a good job of removing all the polyps so that they have the ever-popular ‘clear margins,’ then even if they turn out to be cancerous, the treatment — removal — is already done. So, you can freak out a little, or maybe a lot, (YIKES!) and then recover (WHEW!), and then attempt to move on to resigned acceptance, because you’ll probably have to have another colonoscopy in a year or three to make sure they don’t come back. The bad thing is, of course, that you’ve just been told you have Another Stalker. No NED And that’s the weird part. Once you have a malignant polyp removed, you don’t get to hear that magic phrase No Evidence of Disease. You may — with the assurance of your doc and the pathologist that the entire rat bastard was removed with clear margins — assume for the time being that you are now free of disease. But that’s hardly the same thing. And I doubt if anyone in their right mind would willingly have another colonoscopy a week later just so the doc could officially pronounce their colon as being in that blissful state of NED. At least I wouldn’t. Besides which, my insurance wouldn’t pay for it. This was my experience a year ago. One of the treacherous little bastards removed last year was found to contain cancer cells, and, for the science geeks, was characterized as “tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.” This characterization doesn’t automatically include cancer cells, but mine did. When I saw the doc himself later last year, he told me in no uncertain terms that I’d had non-invasive, in-situ, Stage 0 colon cancer. Great. The thing is, though, that the other six polyps were not adenomatous, i.e., the kind we worry about, but merely hyperplastic, the kind we don’t worry about. And generally speaking, colon polyps are slow-growing little buggers. So, I had a reasonable expectation that my next colonoscopy would find none of the little buggers. No Valentine So, two days ago, I had my one-year follow-up scope. When I arrived, I got hugged by all my nurse friends in Endoscopy/Day Surgery. I was to be knocked out completely this time by the nice anaesthesiologist who came in to introduce himself beforehand. My GI dude also came in to assure me that he would come and talk to me afterward to tell me if he found anything. After I was wheeled in, IV’d, and hooked up to the appropriate monitors — and found yet another old nurse buddy in the OR who was assisting — I laid there watching the IV tube. As the knockout juice began flowing down the tube, I said cheerfully, “Night, night, everyone! Wake me up when it’s over!” And the best part was that I did wake up when it was over, rather than during, which is what happened last year, an event I do NOT recommend. This year, along with the usual toast, graham crackers, juice, tea and coffee on the post-procedure menu, the recovery nurse offered oatmeal. Wow! Oatmeal! With milk and sugar! And it was pretty good, too, although probably sawdust would have been fantastic after not having eaten solid food for a day and a half. Then she helped me sit up, took my blood pressure again, and showed me a little diagram drawn by my GI dude. A diagram? Uh-oh… A little later, my doc confirmed what I already knew, that yes, there was a new crop of polyps. There were more of them than last year, but they were smaller. There was also a teeny ulcer that he thought probably just arose from my having to do two days of prep. But he did biopsy it. He removed the eleven or so new polyps. As usual, they were being sent to the pathologist. As usual, he couldn’t really say from just looking whether they might or might not be malignant. The fact that they were there at all was depressing, and I told him so. I was really hoping for nothing. NED. No Evidence of Disease. “This is not the Valentine I wanted from you,” I said. “How long until the path report is done?” “Give it a week,” he said. “I’ll call you as soon as I know. I got them all, though, so they’re gone.” Gone but not Forgotten So, now, I wait. You all know how much fun that is. I tell myself that ‘gone’ is good. Gone means that, no matter what the traitorous little rat bastards turn out to be, I’m done with them. So, I’m okay, right? No. I’m not okay. I wanted NED. But I didn’t get him. Now, if I’m really honest with myself, what I want is to cry. I was just starting to feel like I was gluing myself and my life back together after my original Stalker. I don’t want to have to be vigilant about another one. I’m really tired of vigilance. Welcome to Never Normal. Welcome to this brief, I hope, Pity Party. Welcome to Cancerland. I promise to be more cheerful later. Just not today. Posted in: Diagnosis, Recurrence, Screening by Kathi 13 Comments colon cancer, colonoscopy",0,1,0.11193756227238376
202,26,4,21,2,2016,2016-02-21,"Published at: 02:02 pm - February 21, 2016 My first guardian angel was a dog. She was a mostly-brown German Shepherd, with the unimaginative but serviceable name of Brownie. I was only an infant when she cared for me, but I must have learned from her, because I grew to have an instinct for devotion and kindness toward animals that I did not learn from humans. According to my parents, even when I began to toddle on two legs, they never had to caution me not to pull ears or tails, or shriek and run headlong at any cat, dog, or other small, non-human creature. Thanks to Brownie, I always approached all four-legged beings gently, with loving intent. The stories I heard most often about Brownie described how she guarded me from interlopers. Naturally, aunts, uncles, and family friends wanted to ‘see the baby’ when they visited for holidays and parties. Usually with a cocktail in hand, they would wander unsteadily, ice cubes tinkling, down the short hallway to my bedroom door, where they would find Brownie, stretched across the threshold, alert and suspicious. If they were unaccompanied by one of my parents, Brownie would not admit them. If they tried, unwisely, to get past her, she would deflect their intrusion with a low, sneering growl. Only if and when my mother or father came along to reassure her, would she arise and let them pass. Then, while they cooed at her small charge, she would park herself at the foot of my crib, ever watchful in case my parents had misjudged their intentions. Before I was old enough to form conscious memories of her, Brownie died of distemper, in an era before its vaccine was routinely distributed. Upset and insecure after my protector abandoned me, I waddled around the house looking for her to no avail. I had no siblings to share my grief. My neighborhood chums were distracting, but they had to return to their own homes after our brief and boisterous playtimes. By then, fissures had begun to appear in the solidity of my parents’ unified joy, and in my mother’s peace of mind. Like a thunderstorm crashing upon our domestic peace, my mother’s unhappiness flashed like lightning, followed by rumbling arguments, tears, and slammed doors. I was too young to understand the reasons for these storms, but not too young to notice them. The cold comfort of reason would come later. For now, my world felt inexplicably unsafe. In my distraught, lonesome state, I must have wrenched a few grownup hearts, because for my next birthday, my godmother gave me a small brown stuffed dog with a rattle inside its paw. I named him Goggie. Thereafter, I never went anywhere without clutching Goggie like a talisman. One of my first clear memories is of my poor mother prying him from my sobbing embrace so she could wash him. I still remember planting myself, indignant and horrified, by the washer and dryer in the basement, tears rolling down my cheeks until Goggie emerged. When Goggie inevitably disintegrated from my abundant love, my godmother provided Goggie Too for Christmas. I also got a doll dressed in a cowgirl outfit. I don’t remember what happened to the doll, but I remember dressing Goggie Too in her fringed skirt, vest, and tiny boots. He didn’t mind. I pretended to be his pony. My mother had by then begun to read to me every day. My favorite book was a story about a long-haired gray kitten with a blue ribbon around his neck. I made her read it to me so many times that I memorized the shapes of the letters on the page. One day, magically, they began to turn from mere ciphers into words I could understand. My mother rewarded me by giving me two long-haired toy kitties, one white and one black, covered in soft fake fur. I don’t remember their names, but Goggie Too readily accepted them as part of our pack, and permitted them to sleep with us at night. By the time I started first grade, I was allowed to escape my house unaccompanied to seek new sources of solace. I struck up a friendship with a kindly, maternal, female collie-mix named Ranger, who lived with our next-door neighbors. Upon my daily greetings, Ranger gave gentle kisses, sat for treats, and permitted fervent hugs. When Ranger died of old age the following spring, I was again bereft, and hoped that perhaps my neighbors, or maybe even my parents, might get another dog. They did not, but I was astonished and delighted when my parents gave me a real kitten for my seventh birthday. He was an orange tiger, and he arrived in our house peeking out of my father’s coat pocket. He liked to chase my mother’s broom as she swept the floor, so at first I named him Sweep-ee. Unfortunately, the name was subject to misinterpretation, so my mother and I discussed it, and I compromised by calling him Sweet Pea instead. Sweet Pea was an affectionate and biddable kitten. He slept in sunspots, like most cats, but his favorite napping spot was the green paper grass in my Easter basket, where he would curl up like an orange pillow. Even when he’d clearly outgrown the basket, he would stuff himself into it, like a muffin that expanded beyond its muffin tin. I wisely refrained from dressing him in doll clothes, but he was quite happy to be wheeled around in my doll carriage. As Sweet Pea grew into young adulthood, he began to shrug off the bounds of domestication. He’d go off for two or three days on hunting trips, and when he returned, would reward us for enduring his absence with a gift of a small animal carcass. My mother would always congratulate him, somewhat timidly, her compliments dampened by the unpleasant task of disposing of his gifts. Sweet Pea was one of the very few orange cats in the neighborhood, and the only orange tomcat. This he verified by means of enthusiastically romancing all the female cats in the vicinity. Of course there were other tomcats likewise occupied, but when our neighbors’ black and white and gray and tabby females produced orange kittens, it was hard to deny their parentage. Unfortunately, he also felt compelled to defend his harem against the competition, and often returned home with a new notch in his ear, but no discernable scars to his ego. After one particularly bloody altercation, my father and I had to take him to the vet, to have him patched up and finally neutered. It was a memorable trip. Despite a thorough fumigation, my father’s car never quite smelled the same afterward. Fortunately, it was the beginning of summer, and after leaving the car windows open for weeks on end, there remained only the merest whiff of eau de tom on the back of the driver’s seat. Alas, Sweet Pea’s romancing days were over, but not, as it turned out, his fighting and hunting adventures. Some instincts never die. Eventually, these instincts overtook the relative merits of domestication, and became a fullblown existential crisis. Sweet Pea demonstrated this one evening as my parents and I were watching ‘The Wizard of Oz’ on TV. For no apparent reason, and without any provocation, Sweet Pea wandered into the livingroom, launched himself at my shoulder and raked his claws down my arm, whereupon he sauntered to his food dish to restore his equilibrium. Fortunately, my injuries were superficial and healed quickly and without complications. Sweet Pea himself, however, earned another trip to the vet, to make sure nothing was physically wrong. After getting a clean bill of health, my father carted him away for good a few days later. My mother attempted to console me by explaining that Sweet Pea was going to live with a local farmer who needed a good mouser. I was not sure I believed her, but I decided it was useless to probe the matter. On the whole, I was inclined to regard Sweet Pea’s attack as a mere aberration, and it did not diminish my fondness for cats in general. However, it did diminish the chances that my parents would adopt another pet anytime soon. So, once again, after only a few short years, I was a lonely only without a furry companion. In the meantime, my parents’ existential crises continued unabated. There were now fights over dinner, exacerbated by the several beers my father would imbibe after work with friends at a local bar. Our dinner would barely be on the table when dishes would be hurled amidst shouted accusations. Even I, at my young age, could not help but observe the pointlessness of these eruptions, and one night, I told my parents exactly what I thought of them. All I achieved was to get hollered at to mind my own business. Infuriated and frightened, I burst into tears, ran into my room, and slammed the door. After that, I kept my opinions to myself. Our near-neighbors no longer had pets that might serve me as surrogate companions, so I began to search farther afield. By now, I was in the fourth grade. After leaving my school friends at their doors as we walked home, I would turn into the circle of two streets that comprised our immediate neighborhood, and scan all the yards and porches for pets to greet. Of course, I already knew the friendly cats and dogs. But I was compelled, no doubt by my own inner turmoil, to notice those few pets who seemed lonely or reticent or conflicted, and, by dint of patient reassurance, to win them over. I was on a mission. My first candidate required a two-week-long campaign. He was a lush, black, long-haired cat that lived at the top of our street, just around the corner from the main road. Every day after school, I would crouch at the end of his front path, where he would be stretched out by the steps in a patch of sun, several feet away, fixing me with an unwelcoming gaze. I murmured to him in my gentlest voice, resting an open hand on the ground, telling him over and over how handsome he was. A week into my efforts, I was caught in the act. The lady who lived there emerged from her front door one afternoon and stopped abruptly at the sight of me, on my knees in my dark green, Catholic school uniform, my book bag flung behind me on the grass, cooing and whispering at a safe distance. I felt some explanation was in order. “Your kitty is really beautiful,” I said, in what I hoped was my most innocent, beguiling voice. “I love long-haired kitties. Is it a boy or a girl?” She smiled. “A boy. His name is Midnight. I’m surprised he’s let you get this close. He usually runs away from strangers.” I was encouraged to hear this. “I’ve been talking to him every day. I hope it’s okay.” “Of course! I’m just walking to the mailbox. If he hasn’t run off so far, you must be making progress.” As she walked away, I sat down and admired the way the sun had bleached patches of Midnight’s black fur into a deep mahogany. He didn’t let me get any closer that day, but he favored me with a slow, accepting blink. A week later, Midnight allowed me to get within a scant two feet of him. I stretched out my hand as far as I could, and kept very still. After staring at me for what seemed like forever, he stretched his face toward me to sniff my fingertips. Very slowly, I curled my fingers under his chin and rubbed gently. He began to purr. I worked up to his ears, crawling minutely closer, when, wonderfully, he flopped on his back and let me rub his luxurious tummy. I heard the front door crack open and looked up to see the lady smiling. A few minutes later, she came out and silently rewarded me with a cookie. Thereafter, I visited Midnight every day, no cookies necessary. His purring was enough. Flushed with success, I decided next to try my skills on what I perceived to be a truly challenging prospect. This was a dog who lived with his family across the street and a few doors down from Midnight. His name was Jack. Jack was a small, long-haired mix of perhaps terrier and something a bit larger and fluffier. He was mostly black and white, with standup ears that flopped over at the tips, and a long, furry tail that curved up like an ostrich plume. Each afternoon, he was placed outside at the end of a long lead, to await the return from school of the two small boys who lived there. He always greeted them happily, I had observed, but barked fearfully at any other child who walked by. Jack’s barking at the neighborhood children did not earn him any compassion. Instead, most of the girls rushed by the house on the opposite side of the street. Most of the boys would taunt him with loud jeers, sometimes tossing sticks or pebbles at his feet just to watch him cower and bark more frantically. They dismissed Jack as mean, nasty and irredeemable, which I could not help but interpret as the pot calling the kettle black. The unfairness of their behavior made me more determined to disprove Jack’s reputation, and to prove concurrently that the neighborhood children were ignorant louts who’d succumbed to mob mentality. I started one afternoon, after visiting Midnight, by crouching just beyond the reach of Jack’s lead and talking softly. Of course he barked at me at first, but I told him I understood. I kept still, with my hands on the ground. I assured him that I was not like the other kids, and apologized for their behavior. I told him I could tell that he loved his family, and that he was just doing his job by protecting his patch. I told him he was a handsome boy, with a beautiful tail. I told him I would visit him every day. I don’t know what he thought of me that first day, but he stopped barking to sit and listen. I said goodbye, stood up slowly, and walked home. The next day, I saved half of my lunchtime sandwich. Jack barked, then stopped while I crouched and talked gently. I broke off bits of lunch meat and carefully tossed them near the end of his lead. I sat and waited. Jack sniffed the treats, but didn’t eat them. Instead, he sat and skeptically listened to my monologue. I told him I didn’t mind at all that he didn’t trust me yet, and told him I’d come back tomorrow. As I walked away, Jack stared after me for several moments, then at last nibbled cautiously at one of my treats. Over the next few days, I took a few extra slices of lunch meat to school for Jack. I repeated my routine, but by now, Jack did not bark at me, but sat and waited. I tossed him a small treat. He sniffed, looked at me, sniffed again and gobbled it up. I told him he was a good boy and went home. On the fifth day, a Friday, I kept the lunch meat in my pocket, squatted closer to the end of his lead, and called his name. He approached slowly and sat. I told him he was a good boy and held out a large piece of meat with the tips of my fingers. Gently, timidly, he grasped it with his teeth. I let it go while he finished it. I put my hand, palm down, on the ground by his front paws. He sniffed and licked my hand. I turned my palm up and let him sniff and lick. I raised my hand a little and he touched it with his nose. We both held still and looked at each other. This might be the moment of truth. “Would you let me pat you?” I asked him. “I would like to be your friend.” Jack considered this for a few minutes. Finally, he inched a little closer and bumped my hand with his nose. I told him he was a good boy. Then he sat, raised his paw and put it in my hand. I grasped it gently and thanked him. He cocked his head. I let go and stroked his leg. He put his paw in my hand again. I stroked his leg and moved up to his shoulder. He let me rub him for a minute. When I stopped, he wagged his tail. I raised my hand higher and crawled a little closer. He wagged and let me rub his ear. I told him he was a very good boy. The next day was Saturday, and I decided that Jack deserved an extra visit. I walked up the hill to his house and found him, outside, on his lead, lying in the sun. He trotted up to me, wagging his tail and grinning. I sat down and rubbed his ears and neck. He licked my face. A few minutes later, three of the nasty boys walked by. When they saw us, they stopped, but kept their distance. Jack chose to keep an eye on them, but didn’t bark. “How did you do that?” one of them demanded. “He’s a mean dog. He’ll probably bite you.” “He’s not mean. And he doesn’t bite. You’ve all been mean to him,” I said. “He’s just shy. If you’re nice to him, he’ll be nice to you.” “Would he let us pat him?” one of the other boys asked. “Maybe,” I said. “You have to crouch down and be gentle. His name is jack. Tell him he’s a good boy and let him come to you. One at a time, not all at once,” I instructed, “and I’ll b
te you myself if you don’t.” Perhaps it was the shock of being contradicted and threatened by a mere girl, but one by one, the boys cautiously followed my commands. Within a few minutes, Jack was happily surrounded by three new friends. One of the boys took a ball from his pocket and rolled it across the lawn, which Jack agreeably fetched and returned. “Wow! He’s really a nice dog!” they said. “Of course he is!” I said. Within days, or maybe hours, my instructions and exhortations were evidently repeated throughout the neighborhood. By Monday, when I came home from school and went to greet Jack, he was already surrounded by a small group of children, including the two small boys from his home, who were rubbing his ears and rolling balls for him to fetch. Jack was no longer the neighborhood pariah, and I was looked upon as having some kind of magical powers. We both suddenly had a lot of new friends. Eventually, I told my parents about Midnight and Jack. By the end of the school year, they’d stopped fighting every night, and my dad went to an AA meeting. I still didn’t get my own cat or dog, but I didn’t mind as much. Posted in: Stories from Childhood by Kathi 4 Comments",0,1,0.07706563999408522
203,26,40,12,2,2013,2013-02-12,"Published at: 04:02 pm - February 12, 2013 So, this year’s colonoscopy was originally scheduled for about four weeks ago, but my doc’s office called to reschedule it. One of the alternate dates offered was Valentine’s Day, which appealed to my admittedly twisted sense of humor. Which goes with my twisted colon, a fact about which my doc informed me the last time we talked. Last year’s colonoscopy yielded a crop of several polyps, one of which was cancerous. Stage Zero. Non-invasive. No, not ‘pre-cancerous,’ according to my doc. Actually cancerous. It and its benign mates were completely removed during the colonoscopy, so no further treatment was needed. I got to have a sort of speed-dating version of my breast cancer adventure when I got that news a year ago. My, how time flies. Here we are, a year later already, and I am eating white, non-fibrous food two days before the festivities, and have already begun drinking my Gatorade-cum-Miralax refreshment, which I have to drink for two days, not one, because I have a twisted colon. In the spirit of romance, I’m drinking it out of a champagne flute. And I’m wondering if there’s some sort of Valentine’s Day protocol for an exchange of greetings between oneself and one’s gastroenterologist when one is having a colonoscopy. Do I give him flowers? Does he give them to me? What about the anaesthesiologist? I rate one of those this year because last year, I woke up during the crucial part feeling like I was being kicked by a Clydesdale. Well, I don’t know, and Dear Abbey is no longer around to ask about this. So, I’ve designed a little greeting card that I would like to receive from my doc afterwards. Could be adapted to whatever test results you’re waiting for. Meanwhile, fingers crossed. I’ll update this post when I get The Word. *NED stands for ‘No Evidence of Disease,’ a phrase we savor in Cancerland. UPDATE, 2/15/13. I did not get my wish. A new crop of polyps was found and removed, and a teeny ulcer was biopsied. The little rat bastards have been sent to the path lab. The teeny ulcer, I was told, was likely caused by the prep itself. The polyps, no matter what they turn out to be, are gone, hopefully with clear margins. If any turn out to be positive again, I will likely be having another colonoscopy way sooner than I’d like (which would be never, but I know that’s a pipe dream). Thanks for the support, peeps. I’ll keep you posted. I may have to wait a week to hear the results. *sigh* Posted in: Diagnosis, Recurrence, Screening by Kathi 8 Comments colon cancer, colonoscopy",0,-1,-0.03201581027667984
205,26,42,15,1,2013,2013-01-15,"Published at: 05:01 pm - January 15, 2013 Elegy to Rachel Our separate portions of time were not, after all, perfectly concurrent. They only overlapped, briefly, waves from the same sea reaching toward the shore. Time as we live it is itself imperfect, marked by linearity. Birth, holidays, love, all that we celebrate lulls us with cycles, the regularity of tides, but still yields to the pull of outside forces, measuring hours, months, years, moments that mark us, building, eroding, shifting our lives like sand. So, too, catastrophes add and subtract our lives’ strata, crash and recede like hurricanes. We grow watchful, learn fear, lose sleep, wait. Each plan we make, each sunrise, turns on an axis we cannot see, a diurnal revolution that is not an act of bravery, but of the involuntary nature of breath and momentum, propelling us forward, creating the ebb and flow of our blood. Death seems unnatural, a betrayal of this ancient and eternal tide, erratic, impersonal, arbitrary. The most powerful gods in our primal pantheons were always the gods of death. And yet, in our cells, we still bear this fatal atavism, flouting, or perhaps defining the insistence of our breath. Here, now, on this shore, you are absent from sight, but not absent from time, although I must continually forgive myself for leaving you behind, swept along by the maelstrom that pushes me further and further from our mutual shore. But in my cells, another force as constant as tides, a benign vortex, turns on the axis of memory. ~ Rachel Cheetham Moro died on February 6, 2012 of metastatic breast cancer.

206,26,43,12,12,2012,2012-12-12,"Published at: 04:12 am - December 12, 2012 Blogging and tweetchats and spam, oh my! Warning: Before reading any further, you might want to grab a cup of coffee and put your feet up. There’s no doubt that the explosion of health-related social media has opened up tremendous possibilities for communication by, about, and among cancer patients. It’s also underscored some tremendous ironies. For example, it’s not unusual to find yourself having a hard time getting your own doctor to return your calls or to listen to you during an office visit, while over on Twitter, you can find yourself chatting up a storm with physicians from all over the world. Meanwhile, I’m sitting here at my kitchen table, waiting for UPS to show up. Because I wrote a blog post about buying myself a Concept2 rower, and because I emailed the link to Concept2, they not only tweeted my post, but sent me several kind emails and informed me that they are sending me a small gift, which UPS is due to deliver any minute now. I can state categorically that, beyond making a very fine rowing ergometer that I’ve liked for years, Concept2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my writing a post about it. And when I sent them my post link, I sent it only as a sincere thank-you, with no expectation of any sort of quid pro quo. Yes, I feel rather warm and fuzzy about them right now. But this blog ain’t chopped liver, and my post provided them with some free PR, so it’s good PR on their part to make nice in return. But where and how do we draw the line these days? How can we tell the difference between online connections that are sincere and helpful, and those that are exploiting us? Take blogging, for example. When I first started this blog on New Year’s Day, 2009, I figured out early on that, if I wanted anyone to read it, it seemed like a good idea to join a few blog networks, like BlogHer, for instance. From that, I learned that the point of these was to encourage you to read and visit and comment on other people’s blogs, the authors of which might then turn around and read, visit, and comment on yours. That’s still a cardinal rule of blogging. Then somewhere in there, I joined Facebook, and a few more blog networks, and then figured out how to make and use widgets. And finally, I started getting the hang of tags and categories and having my webhost submit the blog to search engines periodically. Somewhere along the line, I joined the Twitter-verse, and gave the blog its own Facebook page. And pretty soon other cancer and healthcare and niche networks were sending me emails and asking me to join them, so I did. Not all of them, mind, but some of them. It didn’t take long before I encountered the phenomenon of blog awards and badges. These have run the gamut, from the friendly and sometimes whimsical conferring of appreciation by a few loyal readers who are bloggers themselves, to out-of-the-blue awards given by aggregate resource sites like Healthline.com. I think my favorite was the one organized by Katherine of ihatebreastcancer, who asked readers to nominate those of us who were deemed ‘disruptive breast cancer bloggers.’ I was proud to share the distinct honor of receiving one of the first-ever MAAM of the Year Awards (for the Mammogramatically Challenged And/Or Also Metsters) with five other worthy sisters. In the best circumstance, these sorts of awards can serve as a kind of uber-networking, and let’s face it, it’s always nice to be appreciated. By anybody. But a lot of them occupy a gray area. Some of the early ones I encountered worked more like chain letters or even pyramid schemes of a sort, where your acceptance of an award was contingent on your passing the award to ten others, who then had to pass it on, etc., ad infinitum. Others aren’t so much awards as they are symbols of belonging to some aggregate network, like the badges conferred by NavigatingCancer.com, where you submit your blog for review, and if it is deemed apt, you’re allowed to display their badge. Then there are those that are more complicated, also set up by aggregate sites, with categories and some sort of formal nominating process and voting and such. An example of awards that occupy this latter category are those conferred by WEGO Health. “Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.” It’s very flattering to be nominated for anything, but I do try to vet these things as best I can, especially when they come from aggregate sites. Take my Healthline.com award, for example. I was notified by email that I’d received the award, having never heard of them before. So, I checked out the site first. On their site, it’s easy to find out what their mission is, what their advertising policy is, and who their company sponsors are. I might have been put off by some on this list if it weren’t for the diversity of it and their transparency in making it readily accessible. The sponsors list includes “Aetna, Comcast Ventures, GE, Investor Growth Capital, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, Reed Elsevier Ventures, US News & World Report, and VantagePoint Capital Partners.” I don’t begrudge an aggregate site having sponsors to stay in business, as long as their policies and sponsors are clearly listed. More importantly, on this site, their editorial staff and medical advisors are also clearly listed, and they display the HONcode badge on their site. HONcode badges are conferred after an application process conducted by the Health On the Net Foundation, an international, non-profit oversight group, accredited by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. HON reviews healthcare sites of all sorts, by which it “promotes and guides the deployment of useful and reliable online health information, and its appropriate and efficient use […and] offers a multi-stakeholder consensus on standards to protect citizens from misleading health information.” One of these days, I may get around to applying for their badge myself. When you find the HONcode badge on a site, you can feel some assurance that the site’s content and accuracy have been reviewed by an international team of experts. You can read more about them here. When I received an email from WEGO Health, notifying me that my blog had been nominated for a health activist blog award, I tried to repeat the above vetting process. And ran into some frustration, akin to those circular voicemail menus we all run into when we’re trying to call our insurance companies. Let me just say in the first place that WEGO does not display an HONcode badge. On their ‘About’ page is this statement: “Full-disclosure: WEGO Health funds its support for our network through transparent, community-vetted advertising and sponsorships from health companies: research, content development, education, events, conferences, distribution programs, ad networks, and more. We believe a solid business model helps us to provide an enduring, self-sustaining home for our members.” But when you try to find out who exactly these advertisers and sponsors are, you can’t, at least not easily. There is no search box on their home page and no sitemap. When you click on ‘Sponsorship,’ you only find general statements. When you click on ‘Why We Have Sponsored Content,’ they merely elaborate on the above statement by adding “We believe a solid business model helps us to provide an enduring, self-sustaining home for Health Activists. Every Health Activist participant in a sponsored program is made fully aware of who they are working with and how they can use their experience with WEGO Health to empower their communities. Every sponsor program or ad is clearly marked and all sponsored content (including ads, videos, and landing pages) will always be identified. Everything else is opinions and original work from our Health Activists, our editorial team, or WEGO Health.” Fine and dandy, but can’t you just tell me who these sponsors and advertisers are? Finally, after endless scrolling and clicking, I discovered that if I hovered over ‘Community Education’ and clicked on individual “sharing hubs” topics, I could see on the individual project links that a few pharma companies showed up, like Novartis and Sanofi. A list would have been much easier. “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.” I don’t think it’s too much to ask that if you declare your transparency, visitors should be able to click on one link to find out who funds your projects, pays your bills, and provides expert oversight on your content. And by oversight, I don’t mean your staff list. I mean your advisors. You’re either transparent, or you’re not. Making people hunt all over the place for a sponsors list is not transparency in my book. Big fail, WEGO. Time to redesign your site. So, I tried a little seach engine digging. That wasn’t extraordinarily transparent either. What I did find, however, were several links about FDA hearings that took place in 2009 about whether or not marketers for healthcare companies and big pharma should participate in online social media, and how their presence should or should not be regulated. Basically, WEGO, which made a presentation at the hearings, was in favor of healthcare companies’ and pharma’s participation, in order to promote communication between companies and the end-users of their products. Also weighing in at these hearings was Ogilvy, a large marketing and social media specialty firm, and WebMD, who, like WEGO, has sponsored content on their site. Unlike WEGO, WebMD displays an HONcode badge, and clearly identifies content sponsored by their advertisers on their home page. I couldn’t find a list of their advertisers and sponsors either, but they do have a sitemap with links to their ad/sponsor policies. Somewhere or other, I did manage to find out that WEGO itself serves as a corporate sponsor of DigitalHealthCoalition.org, which in turn partners with and/or is sponsored by pharma companies such as Roche, Sanofi, and Novartis, as well as JUICE Pharma Worldwide, a pharma marketing company. It was also interesting to note that in WEGO’s slide presentation to the FDA, they made several statements regarding agreement among ‘health activists’ on the assertions they made, but the activists polled were all WEGO health activists. Oy. And you thought you were going to read a simple ol’ blog post, didn’t you? As far as those FDA hearings were concerned, apparently, the FDA ended up dropping social media from its resulting guidance agenda. In a way, I can’t say that I blame them. The whole thing has given me a large headache. “Put the patients at the center and ask them what they want to do.” ~ Gilles Frydman, founder of the Association of Online Cancer Resources By the way, that last bit of info on the FDA was reported on the Pharma Marketing Blog, which is written by John Mack, who is an independent writer and podcaster, and who is careful to assert that he is not a paid consultant to pharma. When I was trying to sort through all the above, I came upon another one of his posts, which includes an interview with Gilles Frydman, perhaps one of the most influential patient-centered social media pioneers you’ve never heard of. Mack writes, “In 1995, soon after Gilles’ wife, Monica, discovered that she had breast cancer, Gilles created ACOR [Association of Online Cancer Resources] and the world of Internet resources for cancer patients has never quite been the same since. ACOR’s 159 listservs deliver over 1.5 million email messages per week, none of which you can find on Google.” The reason you can’t find ACOR on Google is that Mr. Frydman had to remove its exposure to search engines to protect his list-users’ privacy, after an incident he describes in his interview with Mack, which you can listen to here. Mr. Frydman is one of the social media patient advocates who does not think that pharma marketers should have direct access to patients via social media. He opined that the FDA hearings were something of a sham, in that the participants did not, in fact, represent patients at all, but their own agendas. In the above post about Gilles Frydman, Mack goes on to say, “There are many people out there who CLAIM to speak for patients but who are actually running businesses that aggregate patients in order to serve them up to marketers. Gilles suggested that the industry BYPASS these middlemen and go directly to the patients who use social media.” Hmmm. What’s the take-away from all this? Well, for me, part of it is to underscore something I already knew. Which is that, like everything else, accepting blog award nominations from aggregate sites requires a lot of caveat emptor. In the meantime, I have to admit that I haven’t been entirely comfortable with this latest WEGO nomination process from the get-go. As requested, I put the nomination badge on my sidebar the other day, and on the blog’s Facebook page, and it’s been heartening to have it endorsed by my readers. But you know what? I don’t need an award to know what you think. That’s the thing with blogs — readers can comment on them directly. And whether I get awards, badges or what-have-you doesn’t make a blind bit of difference with regard to my motivation to write in the first place. Another great thing about blogs and sidebar badges?

207,26,44,8,12,2012,2012-12-08,"Published at: 02:12 pm - December 08, 2012 To all the compassionate, skilled physicians and oncology clinicians I have come to know online and in real life since becoming a member of the cancer club, let me just say thank you. You know who you are. You are not the ‘my-way-or-the-highway’ practitioners. You are the ones who actually listen to your patients; ask open-ended questions; factor quality of life issues and patient concerns into treatment recommendations; believe in informed consent and do your best to fulfill it; and give advice that allows your patients to make their own decisions. But every clinician in the oncology world does not behave in such an exemplary fashion. I know, because I was treated by a few of them. Perhaps I owe them a certain debt of gratitude nonetheless, because the fact that they ticked me off so much is one of the things that turned me into a blogger and an even more staunch patient advocate than I already was. So, what’s my point? Well, one of the hot topics at this past week’s San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium was the cognitive impairment that many of us experience after treatment. There appeared to be two main items in this discussion. The first was the news from the previous week of a study showing that chemo brain can be seen on PET scans. This study made a big splash, including one report that featured an interview with my friend and tireless cancer advocate Jody Schoger. There’s a great write-up about this by another sistah, journalist Xeni Jardin, including links to Jody’s interview, here on BoingBoing. But the second issue that emerged from the SABCS discussion was the potential implications of broadening the discussion of post-cancer-treatment cognitive dysfunction — and perhaps calling it something besides ‘chemo-brain’ — because it affects many of us who did not have intravenous chemotherapy. A report on this latter discussion was published in Oncology Times. I feel a little torn about this. On the one hand, whenever I see cancer related cognitive dysfunction discussed, I often seem to be the person who tediously points out that I have it myself, even though I did not have IV chemo. So the phrase ‘chemo brain’ doesn’t technically apply to me, which leaves me in even more limbo than the one in which my slushy brain has left me. On the other hand, there’s so much we don’t know. For purposes of research and treatment, perhaps we do need a name for the general category of cancer-treatment-related cognitive dysfunction. But we also need a better understanding of — and perhaps more specific names for — the mechanisms which give rise to it, and the differences in how the various forms of cognitive dysfunction manifest themselves. There may be damage arising from chemotherapy that is different from that arising from radiation or surgery, for example, that needs a different name and a different solution. And then, I thought what I always think after reading about another study that identifies another form of collateral damage: ‘Okay, great. What the heck are we supposed to do about it?’ So I was even more interested in a study published at the end of October in the JNCI called, Treating Chemobrain: Rehabilitation Therapies Emerge. But the thing that most struck me, when I started to read the article, was this paragraph, especially the last six words: Patricia Ganz, M.D., at UCLA’s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, traces several stages in the evolution of thinking about cancer and cognition. At first, everyone believed that the blood–brain barrier protected patients from chemotherapy, so patient reports were not taken seriously. Dr. Patricia Ganz is one of my sanity-saviors. It was reading a study conducted by Dr. Ganz and her colleagues, about the immune system biomarkers associated with cancer-related fatigue, that helped me endure and find help with my own fatigue. Dr. Ganz, if I ever meet you in person, please forgive me if I am moved to break into tears and give you a heartfelt hug. You are one of my research goddesses. And I’ll probably have to give you another hug for reinforcing the eminently crucial notion that patient reports need to be taken seriously. “We are chipping away at getting a scientific database to persuade people,” Ganz said. Yes, you are, Dr. Ganz. And bless you for that. To the doctors who did not do their jobs by informing me before treatment of its possible long-term effects, or listen to me afterward when I was suffering from them, here’s a virtual bitchslap and a link to an old post that summarizes the needless misery you helped put me through: Losing It And Trying To Get It Back. Which brings me to the next thing that bothers me about all this: it’s old news, people. I realize that a certain amount of replication and informed skepticism is crucial in the oncology research world before any of us should permit ourselves to get really excited about any new findings. This week’s other SABCS kerfuffle — about the ATLAS/tamoxifen study — is a case in point. A great blog post by Beth Thompson sums it up here: ATLAS, Shrug. But it annoys me hugely when study results about a given topic are touted by hype-headlines as though the researchers have discovered a new planet. And cognitive dysfunction is just such a topic. Way back in 2008, which I realize is practically the Pleistocene Era, a study about chemo-brain was published which included the use of radiologic imaging to verify the existence of chemo brain. The study, Clinical Patterns and Biological Correlates of Cognitive Dysfunction Associated with Cancer Therapy, not only imaged these changes in patients who’d had chemotherapy or brain radiation. The study authors also sought to explain the mechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with cancer treatment, and to identify the patterns of cognitive dysfunction they found in cancer patients. 2008, people. Am I the only person who read this? Another study, published in 2009, sought to examine the impact of chemo brain and cognitive dysfunction on the lives, work and future health of cancer patients. Its purpose was to help encourage better identification of the problem and better solutions for helping us all cope with it. Maybe 2009 is late Pleistocene/early Holocene. Maybe we’ve all got short memories. Maybe I’m the only demonic nerd that trolls Google for pertinent scientific journal articles when I’m writing certain blog posts. Maybe I should rent my search-maven skills to other clinicians. Whatever. Bottom line? The fact that cancer treatment scrambles our brains isn’t news. Despite our admitted deficits of concentration, word-finding, and short-term memory, we cancer patients have been saying this for years. Listen up, already. You might learn something. You might even come up with a way to help us.

208,26,45,5,12,2012,2012-12-05,"Published at: 03:12 pm - December 05, 2012 When I was in my late twenties, I became a card-carrying resident of the city of Boston. I had acquired some real furniture by then, and inevitably, the day arrived when, if I wanted it moved, I could no longer rely on simply renting a U-Haul truck and pressing my friends into service. It became too complicated to schlepp sofas and queen-sized mattresses up the narrow staircases of those old triple-deckers for which Boston is famous. So, I hired some Gentle Giants. Yes, that was really what they called themselves, and they are still around. Gentle Giant Movers was started by a dude named Larry O’Toole, who was, among other things, a varsity rower on one of the several university crew teams that muscled their way down the Charles River. I think he rowed for Boston University, but it could have been Northeastern. He advertised in the Boston Phoenix, which was the ‘cool’ alternative newspaper at the time, and as he quickly gained fans and made some money, he ran a few radio ads on the local rock music stations. When I first called Larry, I naturally asked him about the name, and he explained that his moving crew was comprised of college guys he rowed with and against from the area crew teams. “You’ll understand better when they show up.” He was right. Also, he was a genius. You could not pick movers from a better bunch than the tall, lean, pleasant, courteous, and incredibly strong athletes who happened to row the river. They exceeded their advance billing. Their rowers’ legs allowed them to practically trot up flights of stairs no matter what they were hauling. Their rowers’ shoulders and backs allowed them to carry fully-loaded two-drawer file cabinets like they were shoe boxes. They didn’t drop or bump things. They were very impressive and their services were affordable. Gentle Giants indeed! Not surprisingly, they are also still in business, still hiring college athletes, and are a national company now. Around the same time, a new health club opened near my apartment. It was a friendly, comfortable place, set up in an old Boston building that had once been used as a local cultural club. The owner/manager was a really sweet guy and a body-builder who, amazingly, was committed to making the club a place that was not dominated by muscle-bound, male steroid-heads, but one that would feel safe and comfortable for women, too. He succeeded. As luck would have it, a few other enterprising rowers in Vermont had started a company that made competition and Olympic-class oars for crew teams. They had also just started making and selling a new kind of ergometer made especially for rowers, and my new health club had a couple. Well, heck, no one needed to convince me that rowing was an incredible way to get fit. Thus did I first warm my butt — and every other part of my body — on a Concept2 Rower. It soon became my favorite cardio exercise. I ended up using a Concept2 Rower as part of my fitness regimen for well over a decade. When I moved to Rhode Island to go to grad school (once again employing the Gentle Giants!), the university had them in their student gym. But once I graduated, the only local health club that had one was too expensive and too crowded, especially for a newly-hatched physical therapist with student loans to pay off. The clubs I could afford had rowers — usually one that was relegated to a forgotten corner — but they weren’t Concept2’s. I made do, but it was like driving a Volkswagon Beetle after years of driving a Mercedes. Then came my current decade of healthus-interruptus. I started off the decade by having back surgery to remove a herniated lumbar disk (long story for another time). The surgery was completely successful, but regaining my former strength and flexibility was a long, arduous process. Then came menopause, with all its lovely, attendant complications, like insomnia, hot flashes, night sweats and exhaustion. And just as I was getting the hang of my new internal thermostat, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And we all know what happened after that. The ‘Gift’ that keeps on giving. Four years later, I find that I have written countless posts about the long and late-term side effects of cancer treatment. I’ve charted my slow crawl out of the cancer-related fatigue ditch; the sometimes scary and occasionally comical and always frustrating brain-slush; my post-radiation respiratory adventures; and the painful soft-tissue fibrosis in my chest and shoulder girdle that I struggle with daily. My first two years post-treatment were a virtual write-off as far as fitness was concerned. The neurostimulants I took only managed to help me keep my job. Last year, I started to have a little more energy, but I still paid for the few extracurricular activities I managed to engage in with days of body-slamming fatigue. This year, I finally began to have a few odd moments when I felt sort of, well, normal. Encouraged, I started walking. I used my Theraband faithfully to loosen up my chronically-tight arm and shoulder. I bought a hula hoop and a jump rope, and used them from time to time to shake things up a little. Just by being vertical more often, I was finally able to lose nearly all of the weight I had put on post-treatment. At last, my ‘volume’ by weight was almost back to what it used to be, but the ‘texture,’ shall we say, still had a high proportion of flab. Walking is great, but limited by such vicissitudes as Hurricane Sandy. Treadmills are okay, but they did nothing for my poor shoulder. The hula hoop and the jump rope have been fun, but when the weather is bad, I just don’t have enough room or high enough ceilings inside my house to use them. Plus, my concentration is still not stellar. I’ve spent almost as much energy this year trying to think up ways to get a good, simple, weather-proof work-out as I’ve spent working out. I needed to come up with Something Else. A much better gift. And then I recalled, with great fondness, the smooth, meditative, deceptively easy, yet whole-body exertions of rowing on a Concept2. I confess I’d thought many times over the past decade of buying one of my own. But they ain’t cheap, and cancer put a serious dent in my bank account, so I set the whole idea aside. Until a few weeks ago. And I began to think, while I’m not having to replace the roof or the oil burner or some major appliance, and my car is working, and I can afford my refinanced mortgage, now might be a good time to give myself a real gift, one that would help me give myself back to myself. Last my brandy new Concept2 Model D rower arrived. Eight screws and twenty minutes later, it was ready for use. I have just enough room on the floor, under the double doorway between my kitchen and livingroom, to use this two-feet wide, three-feet tall, eight-feet long vehicle-to-future-fitness, and when I’m not using it, it easily separates into two pieces that I can stand on end and wheel into a corner. Rowing is not for everyone, I readily admit. In the first place, you have to get the hang of it. I was very fortunate that from the beginning of my long acquaintance with a Concept2, I had the right body type and biomechanics for it. I managed very quickly to master the smooth, continuous leg/back/arms drive and arms/back/legs recovery that comprise a proper stroke. For the novice — and especially for those who’ve tried it and didn’t get the hang of it — there is ample help and advice on the Concept2 website, including videos, that cover how to row and how to train safely. A few more caveats are needed for us cancer patients, and I plan to write a more PT-ish post about them soon. But for me, as soon as I sat down and began to pull, my muscle memory kicked in and I was off to my first thousand meters, with a nice, smooth force curve showing up on the monitor. All the things I loved about using this machine came right back. In the first place, I can sit down. In the second place, it responds to me, adjusting itself instantly to how much effort I’m up to, and not the other way around. You rule the machine, it doesn’t rule you. And perhaps most importantly, I don’t have to use my brain. I can listen to the news or play some tunes and just do it. Like yoga, you breathe with your position — inhaling as you release the stroke, exhaling as you perform the next one — so even as you start to break a sweat, you are relaxed. It’s meditative, zen, and I can pretend I’m rowing down the Seine if I want to. And afterward, with all my muscles fully warmed, I can stretch my fatigued, fibrotic tissue toward something like my normal, pre-cancer flexibility. So far, I’ve managed to row a little over 10,000 meters, logging them all into the online Concept2 logbook. Once I row another 990,000 meters, they’ll give me a teeshirt. And I will be getting that shirt. It might take me a year or two, but I know that when I get that million-meter teeshirt, I’ll have gotten much more than just something to wear. For now, I am just relieved and happy that I made the right decision. Like reconnecting with an old, accommodating friend, I look forward to spending time with my rower as often as I can. It may not look very friendly to anyone else — and it may in fact look more like an implement of torture to a lot of folks. But to me, it looks like hope. December 7, 2012: A little update. I emailed the link for this post to Concept2, and they responded by Tweeting it today. They also informed me that they are sending me a gift to help keep me motivated. Thank you, Concept2!

209,26,46,17,11,2012,2012-11-17,"Published at: 02:11 pm - November 17, 2012 One door closes but another opens. In a certain way, it can be easier to find gratitude when your life is turned upside down. At least it often works that way for me. When I’m really up against the wall, like I was when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, a switch often seems to click on, and I tend to marshall some inner resources by seeking out all the small and large things that help me keep my sanity. Like having loving friends. And a roof over my head. And chocolate. You get the idea. Last week, I was talking with one of my physical therapy patients about Thanksgiving and the upcoming holiday season. This person happens to be bilingual, and as we practiced leg exercises, we found ourselves singing French Christmas carols, en français, naturellement. And in that moment, I was grateful for the sheer delight of such unexpected whimsy, happening alongside my more mundane clinical pursuits. And that contrast led me to remember a vacation I spent in Languedoc a few years after I finished grad school, with one of my best friends from our class. I’ll call her Thea. Southern France wasn’t our original destination. We thought we’d go to Prague. But we were still paying off school loans, so money was tight, even with a ‘real’ salary at last. And through my writing grapevine, I came upon an American woman who had a house for rent in Languedoc, in a small village called Montpeyroux, for far less than we would spend on any other type of accommodation except perhaps camping. And we didn’t want to go camping. Thea had lived in Spain for several years, and had friends there, so we thought, while we were in France, we could hop over to Spain for a weekend and see them. Thus, we flew to Paris, hopped a commuter plane to Montpelier, picked up the Peugeot I’d rented, and drove to Montpeyroux. It was like entering a dream. None of the dozens of photos or films I’d seen of southern France prepared me for how exquisitely beautiful it was in the countryside. The colors really are different, full of vivid light. It requires no imagination at all to understand why so many artists have found inspiration there. It was the end of May. Acres of la lavande (lavender) were in bloom, and tidy rows of wine-grape vines flourished everywhere. Les fraises et les framboises (strawberries & raspberries) were ripening. The markets had les asperges (asparagus) ready to sell. It was off-season, which meant that instead of being blisteringly hot, it was temperate during the day, 60-70 degrees most days, and pleasantly cool at night, dropping to perhaps 50. The sun rose by 5:00 a.m., bringing with it flocks of les hirondelles (swallows), and did not completely disappear until 10:00 p.m. Our French neighbors in Montpeyroux, bundled in their down coats, often apologized for the ‘cold’ weather until I explained that back in Boston, it was rainy and beaucoup plus froid than it was in Languedoc. For several reasons, it turned out that being in Europe again seemed to bring up for Thea all kinds of remembered heartaches from her life in Spain. Among them was the death of her Spanish fiancé in a motorcycle accident the day before they were to be married. She had told me the story a few years before. But instead of talking about her obvious disquiet now, on our third day in France, just as I was beginning to recover from jetlag, she picked a fight with me. She could not tell me what it was that I had done to anger her, but suddenly, she found my company intolerable. My apologies and entreaties yielded no explanation but an extensive list of my flaws. I was boring. I was pedantic. I was arrogant. I was thoughtless. My admittedly lame high-school French was pathetic. The result of all this was that Thea decided to spend the rest of our vacation in Spain with her old friends, while I stayed in Montpeyrous in our rented house, with my rented Peugeot and my camera and my French grammar books. We would only meet up again in Montpelier at the end of the sixteen days, when we had to fly home. Needless to say, I was devastated, doubly so because her assault on my character was incomprehensible. A few days after she left, I managed to call a good friend back home who knew us both, and tearfully told the tale. She was as astonished as I was. By the time I called her, I’d come down with a cold. The next day, I drove to the nearby town of Gignac, and bought cough drops and lots of tissues at the local pharmacie. La pharmacienne told me kindly to soignez-vous. I took her advice to take care of myself the only way I could — by immersing myself in this lovely place si agréable, and trying to make a virtue of my aloneness, telling myself that I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted to do it. I began by walking. Down the street from the house I was staying in, I discovered an entire courtyard blooming with irises. On a walk through the village, I met an old woman sitting in her garden who taught me the French word for swallows and cut me a bouquet of her roses. I looked up verbs and nouns and adjectives in my French books. I poured over maps and took day trips. In St. Guilelm le Désert, I helped a shop manager translate a transaction with some English tourists. Afterward, she gave me her phone numbers and told me to call her if I needed anything. In Pézenas, home for a time to Molière, I met a professional photographer from Aix en Provence. We kept running into each other, finding ourselves drawn to taking the same pictures. His camera was much nicer than my old Minolta, but I also discovered that we shared a common instinct to see with an artist’s eye, that my background in drawing and painting translated to the viewfinder. Because I was by myself, I was more approachable. In banks where I changed money, in cafes, in shops and museums and old churches, people would introduce themselves, compliment my French, offer help, even invite me to visit their homes. One of the loveliest experiences I had was attending a classical music concert in a very old church in a village whose name I have forgotten. After the intermission, two pianos were moved into place, and a father and his son sat down at them to play a special arrangement of Ravel’s Bolero. To sit in this stately French church, surrounded by French musicians and music lovers, to hear one of the most well-known pieces of music by one of the most loved of French composers, played with passionate magnificence, was a moving, indescribable joy. I went up to the conductor/organizer of this concert afterwards to convey, in my by-then somewhat less halting French, my profound thanks, and discovered that she was from Australia, married to a French native, and spoke English. And she told me about another concert a few days later in another church, which I happily attended. Thea and I met up in Montpelier as planned, and managed to fly all the way back to Boston by maintaining a strained but scrupulous politeness. But our friendship was over. She rebuffed all my attempts to communicate and sort things out. I was left with a deep sense of loss and heartache and ambiguity. But then I took my several rolls of film to be developed, had several photos enlarged, and discovered anew an even deeper sense of creative resilience. Those photos netted me my first art show in what was for me a new medium. So much of what I’ve learned about gratitude is like that trip. Circumstances beyond our control may heap on us some unexpected heartache, while at the same time forcing us to look outside ourselves in turn, because we must. And sometimes when we do, what we really need will find us. And if we are alert, we will embrace it. Thea and I had been the best of friends for five years. We’d been through the hell of graduate school, the death of my mother, and of her father, her diagnosis and successful treatment of Hodgkins lymphoma, and many other challenges in those five years. And yet, for no apparent reason, she no longer wanted my friendship. But the richness of an ancient landscape and the kindness of people whom I will never see again gave me gifts beyond counting. And for that, I’m forever grateful. Posted in: Art & Music, Attitude, Survivorship by Kathi 15 Comments Art & Music, France, friendship, photography",0,1,0.09175780918427975
210,26,47,23,10,2012,2012-10-23,"Published at: 03:10 pm - October 23, 2012 Facedown and flummoxed. Because I am creatively demented, one of the things I did as I was having a breast MRI this morning, was to start composing a parody of the lyrics to “The Trolley Song” that Judy Garland sings in the movie, Meet Me in St. Louis. Clang, clang, clang went the magnets, Bang, bang, bang, it was hell. Thump, thump, thump went my heartstrings As I hoped it would all turn out well. Ache, ache, ache went my shoulder, Pound, pound, pound went my head, Thump, thump, thump went my heartstrings As I tried to defuse my own dread. The day was bright, the air was sweet, But my anxiety just knocked me off my feet. I tried to talk, I couldn’t squeak, In fact I felt so lost that I could barely speak. Buzz, buzz, buzz, it was over. Time to finally emerge. ‘You should drink lots of fluids. That will help all the contrast stuff purge.’ I tried to stand, I needed help. And when I moved my arm, I gave a little yelp. The tech was sweet, Knew what to do, Because she said her mom had had breast cancer, too… That was when I pretty much completely lost it. I’d started to lose it early on, sometime during the third set of clangs. It occurred to me that each clang and bang perhaps represented one of the few thousand image slices the MRI was taking of my breasts. So I started to cheer them on. “Just find those effing cancer cells, okay? I hope you don’t find ANY, but if they’re there, just find every one of those rat bastards.” And I started to cry, which isn’t the best thing when your face is jammed into a foam-covered face rest. At least I had a face rest. Last time I had one of these, there was no face rest, so my head was turned to one side the whole time, leaving me with a massive crick in my neck when it was over. So, I was glad I didn’t have a crick in my neck today, just a couple of pressure lines across my cheeks and forehead from the face rest. No biggie. All I’d have to do was mop my teary face in the bathroom and rearrange my hair. Yep. That’s me, the Queen of Snark, feeling decidedly unsnarky, trying to see the glass half full. My right shoulder had turned to cement from trying — and occasionally failing — to keep it still for forty minutes. I’d had to squish the little rubber thingy a few times so I could ask the tech to wait a second while I tried to revive some circulation. “Radiation damage,” I explained to her when it was over. “It’s forever.” “Yeah, that’s what my mom says.” “So, your mom is okay?” “Yes. So far.” “I hope you stay okay, too,” I said, hugging her tearfully. “The bathroom is right down the hall.” Now, now, now is the hard part. Wait, wait, wait for a week While they check ev’ry image That my dense tissue yields to the magnetic fields of the scan, And I hope that they plan To inform me as Soon as they can and they’ll say I’m okay and instead I’ll be dancing with NED! Dedicated to everyone one being tested and waiting for results. With love. UPDATE: Got my results on 10/26/12, and they were NEGATIVE!!

To the physicians who allegedly analyze tissue at my local hospital, but who are in point of fact employed, not by the hospital, but by the independent contractor known as University Pathologists, and who use a billing service that calls itself Affiliated Professional Services, let me tell you something. It’s a big mistake to aggravate a cancer patient who’s just had her breasts squished for the umpteenth time. And has to wait for her results. And that’s all I’m saying about breasts or cancer, because this is not a post about breast cancer, but about the healthcare system in this country. And the third-party payer system. This all started a few months ago, when I started getting these mysterious voicemail messages. The person leaving them never said who they were. They said something like, ‘This is a message for Kathi Kolb. Please call 1-800-SCAMMER regarding an unpaid medical bill for a recent hospital procedure.’ Okay, the number they left wasn’t 1-800-SCAMMER, but it might as well have been, because that’s exactly what I thought of this anonymous and vaguely threatening message, that it was left by some scam artist. You know they’re out there, these people. I picture some windowless room, full of poor hapless gits who lost their jobs in 2008, employed by this bogus company, sitting at rows of tables, each wearing a headset connected to some computerized phone with an auto-dial program hooked up to it, calling everyone in a certain area code. Doesn’t matter who they call. Doesn’t matter if most of them haven’t been near a hospital for the past ten years. Chances are, they’ll hit enough people who have, and a certain percentage of naive, lonely, over-conscientious souls will take the bait and call back. As an old boss of mine used to say, “If you throw enough shit against the wall, some of it’s bound to stick.” Usually though, these scammers give up after a few tries. Not these people. They must have left at least a half dozen messages for me over a period of about three weeks. Clearly, ignoring them was not going to stop them, and direct action was called for. But first, being the moderately resourceful skeptic I am, I did a search of the phone number they left me in their last voicemail. And discovered it belonged to an entity with the dubious-sounding name of Action Collection Agency. They claimed to be located in the Boston area. They had a quasi-legit-looking website, but so what? Any jerk can throw together a website these days. So, I called them. And asked for customer service. And said to the person who answered, “Who are you people and why are you leaving me cryptic, anonymous voicemail messages?” The person took my name and phone number, looked it up and told me that I owed $310 for a hospital procedure I had recently. “Oh, really,” I said. “How come this is the first I’m hearing about this? What hospital? What procedure? And for what date?” This person gave me the name of my hospital and a date, but said he didn’t know what procedure because the bill was for pathology services. “My insurance has paid all my recent medical bills,” I said, admitting nothing. I know that these people try to worm info out of their victims. Just because they had the name of my hospital didn’t mean a thing. Could have looked it up in the area code phone book. “Who is billing me for pathology services?” I asked. This person couldn’t supply a name, but said it was the pathologist who claimed to work for my local hospital’s pathology lab, and had analyzed my tissue, and that I owe this person $310 for services rendered. “Send me a copy of the original bill,” I said. “And then we’ll see.” This was June 19th. I know because I kept notes. Long story short, I also called the billing department at the hospital, where I had, in fact, had a colonoscopy this past January, which did involve having polyps analyzed in the pathology lab. The billing department looked up the charges and said I didn’t owe them anything as far as they could see. “The pathology lab was paid by your insurance company. Maybe your doctor is billing you separately. They do that sometimes.” “The doctor involved is a gastroenterologist, not a pathologist. Do the pathologists send out their own bills?” I asked. “I don’t think so, but you should call your doctor and find out.” Well, I knew my doctor wasn’t going to know about this — or care — so I called the pathology lab directly. They didn’t know anything, and referred me back to the billing department. By then I was already convinced that this was completely moldy baloney, and I was too annoyed to make any more phone calls, so decided to give up until I got the alleged copy of the alleged bill from the alleged collection agency. And then I did something more soothing. I ate a frozen yogurt fudgsicle, if memory serves. A week or so went by, and I didn’t receive anything from the Action Collection Agency. Not a big surprise. I mean, really. Who came up with that name? Somebody who watched too many Roadrunner cartoons as a kid? Might as well call it the Acme Collection Agency. So I called them back again and asked to speak to a manager. This was July 3rd. Repeat of story. Repeat of request for copy of the original bill. Then I called my insurance company. The insurance company confirmed that they did get a bill from the hospital, with a line item for the path lab, for $1,540, which they paid. They knew nothing about an additional charge for $310. “Okay,” I said, “so no one sent you an extra bill for pathology? Because the hospital told me I didn’t owe them anything and they didn’t send out an extra bill for it. And why aren’t these people, whoever they are, accepting the $1,540 you paid them and be done with it? Like everyone else usually does?” The insurance person didn’t know, but said he would send me a copy of the EOM (that’s an “Explanation of Benefits” statement, for the uninitiated) for the colonoscopy, so I could try to figure out what was going on from there. I got the EOM a few days hence. It didn’t help. So I called the hospital billing department again and talked to a different person. After hashing things out, this clerk did say that some of the doctors in the hospital actually worked for independent contractors, “like the radiologists,” she said. And that they might send separate bills. And that my employee benefits would cover that anyway, and all I’d have to do is bring a copy of the separate bill to the human resources department. She didn’t know whether the pathologists did indeed send me a separate bill, but they might have. I called the pathology lab again, and again they didn’t know anything about it. So, I gave up, decided to wait once more for the in-Action Collection Agency to send me yet another alleged copy of this alleged bill, and ate yet another frozen yogurt fudgsicle. Another few weeks went by, and nothing came in the mail. Then I was busy and distracted for a few weeks by having to see doctors. Then I was busy with work and going to the dentist and spending more money for copays and things that my insurance doesn’t cover. Then I checked my snail mailbox again and found an envelope from the Acme In-Action Collection Agency, containing an extremely lame-looking printout. It was not, mind you, an actual copy of an actual bill that might actually have been sent for these alleged pathology charges by these alleged pathologists. Instead it was a printed statement, from some office printer, which claimed to come from my local hospital, where I had my colonoscopy, for pathology on the correct date, but showing an address in a different, albeit neighboring, state, where my local hospital is decidedly not located. Sigh. The lower part of this printout said that I was being billed for $1,050, to which had been applied an insurance ‘adjustment’ of $739.62, leaving a balance owing of $310.38. I had to work for a few days and didn’t have a chance to make any more phone calls until today, after I got home from my latest squishing. Which ‘looked okay,’ but I’ll wait for the written report. Which I’m not writing about here. Yet. Because I’m still sick to death of breast cancer (see previous post). Which brings us to this afternoon. I called the hospital billing department yet again. And finally talked to someone who was able to confirm that indeed the pathologists who evaluate tissue in the hospital lab actually work for an entity called University Pathologists, who are — ta-dah — located at the very address in the not-this-but-the-neighboring-state printed on the statement I received from the ersatz collection agency. ‘Which university?’ I wanted to say, thinking that this was another lame, fake-sounding moniker. Maybe I should offer to draw them a fake-looking logo to go with it, something cheesy and trite, like a row of Doric columns topped with a pediment. The Who-Knows-Which-University Pathologists, I was told, themselves employed a company called Affiliated Professional Services to do their billing. Or bidding, as the case may be. Now, this — this name is the worst one yet, in my opinion. Right out of Let’s-Make-Up-An-Important-Sounding-But-Meaningless-Name-101. ‘Affiliated’ with whom? ‘Professional’ what? Bullshit artists? In any event, the billing clerk had a phone number for these people, and said if I could get them to send me a copy of their original bill, then I could take that to human resources and the hospital would take care of it. So, admittedly not in the pleasantest of moods by then, I called these professionally affiliated service people, and I was not terribly charming to the customer service clerk whose misfortune it was to convince me not to report them immediately to the state Attorney General’s office. She claimed that they, meaning University Pathologists, had sent me a bill a few months back, and confirmed that they had my correct street address. “I don’t recall getting a bill from them,” I said, “and if I did, frankly, seeing that name, I would have thought it was a scam and probably thrown it out. Besides which, my insurance already paid the path lab over fifteen hundred dollars. So what is this extra charge for? And why is it that the first I hear about this extra bill is from a collection agency I’ve never heard of? Which also has a dorky name that makes it sound like a scam?” “Well,” she said, “we ourselves did make three phone calls to you.” “Who? Affiliated Professional Services? Saying what? I got several anonymous phone calls a few months back from people who did not identify themselves, claiming I owed them $310. Meanwhile, the hospital said I didn’t owe anything for my procedure. So, you think I should have called you back? Let me tell you, I am not in the habit of returning anonymous phone calls demanding money that I don’t, to the best of my knowledge, owe. If some of those calls were from you people, you need to identify yourselves when you leave messages. And be convincing, because that name doesn’t exactly sound like a legitimate enterprise.” I admit I was rather vociferous by that point. “I’m very sorry,” this woman said. She did, in fact, sound sorry. No doubt she was sorry. I would have been sorry to listen to me. “Do you know how many phone calls I’ve had to make just to find out who you people allegedly are? Even the clerks at the pathology lab have never heard of you. In fact, no one at the hospital had heard of you, until today apparently. What, are you trying to keep your identity a secret?” “I’m really sorry you’ve been through all this trouble.” “Yeah, well, so am I. And I have yet to see a bill. You want money? Send me a copy of the actual bill. Not that piece of nonsense the collection agency sent me that didn’t even have your name on it.” “I’ll get that right out, Ms. Kolb.” “Fine,” I said, and hung up. I’d run out of frozen yogurt fudgsicles, which was a grievous oversight, else I’d have had another. Instead, I want for a walk. A long, sweaty walk. Like, an hour, up and down hills. Probably at least three miles. Then I came home and did a little research on this craptastic phenomenon of specialty physician independent contractors and their mysterious billing practices. Originally, it was claimed that these contracting groups would simplify things, make things more efficient, and lower healthcare costs. I ask you, does all this sound simpler, more efficient and less costly to you? Me either.

215,26,51,24,7,2012,2012-07-24,"Published at: 01:07 pm - July 24, 2012 Makeshift memorial for the Station Nightclub fire, 2003. Like many of us, I’ve been stunned beyond comprehension at the shootings that occurred just days ago in Aurora, Colorado. But in the aftermath, it’s not the issue of gun ownership that occupies my mind. It’s not trying to fathom the unfathomable motives that would drive someone to stockpile assault weapons and ammunition, to boobytrap his apartment with tripwires and grenades and gasoline, and decide to shoot seventy-one people in a public cinema at a Batman movie. What gets to me is thinking about the people who were there, going out for a night of communal fun and getting shot at instead. Hearing the details about the individuals who died, how young most of them were, stops me in my tracks. And I think of all the grief-stricken people who will miss them, who cannot believe the circumstances of their loss. And I think of all the people who managed to escape with their lives, but were injured, some gravely, who are traumatized in every way now, who may not recover, who may be disabled emotionally or physically, whose lives are turned upside down, who will need a long time and a lot of help to get past this. What I think about is a Friday morning in February, 2003, here in Rhode Island. And of getting a phone call as I was preparing to go to work that morning. The caller was one of the secretaries from the main office of the rehab department at our local hospital. She called to tell me that Nancy, my colleague at the outpatient rehab clinic where we worked, who was the other full-time physical therapist there, would not be coming in that day, because she needed to find out if her 23-year-old son survived the fire the night before. “What?” I gasped. “What fire?” “The fire at the Station Nightclub. Didn’t you hear it on the news? The band ‘Great White’ had a gig at the Station last night. Nancy’s son was there. And there was a fire. And people couldn’t get out. And he never came home.” I was instantly sick with fear. I turned on the car radio as I drove to work. When I got there, our receptionist, my friend Kerry, was just pulling in. We looked at each other. Our eyes welled up. We opened the clinic and started to get on the phone, rearranging patients. I fit as many of Nancy’s patients into my schedule as I could, and another PT from the main office was going to come in the afternoon to help me. All day we slogged through work, half-numb, listening to the radio in the gym, waiting to hear more news, hoping for the best, fearing the worst. I remember retreating from time to time to our charting office, not to catch up on my paperwork, but to sit and cry. Finally, at the end of the day, I called Nancy’s home and got an equivocal update: they had found her son’s car, near the club, but he himself never turned up for treatment at any of the area hospitals. It was believed that his body was among a group that had succumbed near the stage and never made it out. A confirmed identification was expected the next day. But they were pretty certain already. The next day, we got the final word. Yes, Andrew had died. He was a tall, bright, handsome young guy, who dropped in at the clinic now and then. He looked like his mom. He had finished his bachelor’s degree and was working for a while, to save money for law school. He’d gone to the club to meet a customer from work who’d become a friend. The fire started when some pyrotechnics set off by the band’s manager ignited the ceiling and walls around the stage. In less than six minutes, the entire club was engulfed. Altogether, a hundred people died. Another two hundred and thirty were injured. A hundred and thirty-two people managed to get out without physical injuries. Andrew’s friend was hospitalized, but survived. But no one escaped unscathed. It would be months before Nancy came back to work. Meanwhile, at the clinic, almost immediately, people who’d been treated and released by the local emergency departments began to trickle in for rehab. Dozens more were still hospitalized, with burns, respiratory damage, fractures, trauma. As the weeks passed, we treated more of them. Every day, I evaluated people with the marks of panic, heat and smoke, and desperate escape on their bodies, as I charted their bruises and sprains and broken ribs and shortness of breath. Every day, someone cried when I asked them how they were doing, or when I had them lie down on my treatment table while I tried to warm up and stretch and massage away some of the damage. Rhode Island is a small state. Everyone knew someone who’d been there, often several people. Most of those who’d been there were young, in their twenties and thirties, the kind of people who liked hard rock and superhero movies. Those who survived felt guilty or angry or had nightmares or chronic pain or walked with crutches if they could walk at all. Meanwhile, there were wakes and funerals everywhere. For weeks. Hundreds of people showed up at Andrew’s wake. The media were a constant presence. They seemed to interview everyone they could find. I was relieved they never found their way to our clinic. I certainly didn’t want to be interviewed. It was the fourth deadliest fire in U.S. history. On and on the aftermath went, for weeks and months and years. Some of the survivors and some of the families of those who died found solace and validation in all the media attention and class-action lawsuits. It helped them demand answers, insist on accountability for the circumstances of the tragedy. It helped as they called for a close examination of the laws and regulations that were supposed to prevent things like this from happening. Many more, like Nancy and her family, found the public spectacle bizarre and surreal. It was intrusive, and ultimately did not help them with their personal grief. Many of my patients got sick of the hype, just wanted to be left alone so they could get over it all. Lawyers and journalists couldn’t help their aches and pains go away, or bring back their friends and sweethearts. Or cope with getting back to work. Or figure out how to get to sleep at night. At the site of the Station Nightclub fire. This is what I’ve been thinking of since the shootings in Aurora. I’ve been thinking of the damage and the aftermath. The tangible aftermath of scars and contusions, and the emotional aftermath of funerals and post-traumatic stress. I’ve been thinking of my clinical sisters and brothers, the paramedics and doctors and nurses and rehab therapists and social workers and counselors, knocking themselves out to help all these wounded individuals and their wounded families, feeling battered themselves as they try to help these folks sort out their shattered lives. I’ve been thinking of Nancy, and how she and her family continue to leave town every February, to escape the anniversaries and the opportunists who make hay of them. I’ve been thinking about how, before every concert or play or indoor public gathering I’ve attended in New England since that February, someone now takes a few minutes before the event to ask everyone to please take note of all the exits and emergency lights in the theater. Just yesterday, I discovered that someone I’ve known for months now has a son who was there that night, who escaped by shoving past a bouncer who was unaccountably blocking an exit door, and managed to yank off the lock, dragging himself and another young man to safety. Nine years later, there’s still no coherent answer to why it happened. If there’s one thing I understand even more profoundly than ever, it’s that healing always takes longer than you think. Four years ago today, I was told I had cancer. I’m a lot better, but not all better. There’s no question that it helps to know others who understand what you’ve been through, because they’ve been through it themselves. But there’s a fine line between the comfort of public awareness and the exploitation of public spectacle. At the end of the day, hype doesn’t heal. That’s certainly been true for me. Ultimately, healing is personal, and it happens in private, one day at a time, one body, one person, one life at a time.

216,26,52,25,6,2012,2012-06-25,"Published at: 11:06 pm - June 25, 2012 Been an interesting few weeks. I can’t talk about all of it, but let’s just say that a confluence of recent happenings, both planned and unexpected, have put me through the emotional wringer. One of my blog sisters recently published an excellent post on trying to recover her Equilibrium after all her cancer treatment and cancer-related surgeries are now (for the time being) done. In it, she writes: “My pact with myself is to start picking up the pieces of all that has been cast aside. My two biggest challenges? Limited energy and impatience. […] But I am so behind. And when I hit the wall, it is made [of] unforgiving, solid brick.” Oh, yeah. The last few weeks have reminded me of how fragile my so-called equilibrium is. I know I have some. Else I’d be in a rubber room by now. It’s just that whenever I feel like I’ve bolstered it a little, something can come along to throw me right on my already-bruised keister. I’m not even talking about big somethings. I’ve weathered a few big somethings. I’m talking about the little somethings — the thoughtless remark, the unintended consequence, the erroneous assumption, even the rare and unexpected bit of kindness and validation — that remind me of exactly how hard it is to live in this parallel universe of cancerland, and how invisible it is to many of the people who don’t live here. I’ll describe the unexpected kindness and validation. Hell with the other stuff. Last week, I officially ditched my former breast cancer surgeon and met my new breast cancer surgeon. [Choosing A New Doctor] My former surgeon has left her practice, and my new surgeon was, as of last week, still waiting for her old practice to send him my file. So today, I returned a voicemail from my former surgeon’s secretary to chase it down. This woman, whom I’ll call Miranda, has been stellar from the moment I first talked to her. That was after the suspicious screening mammogram I had in 2008, which was followed by the suspicious diagnostic mammogram I had several days later, which was immediately followed by the radiologist walking into the room to tell me I needed to get a biopsy. With arguable foolishness, I wasn’t even worried at that point. Just figured everyone was being conscientious. So, I asked around and got a few names and called up the office of my now-former breast surgeon. I said I needed to see the surgeon and was shifted over to Miranda. I told her my brief story, said I was advised to get a breast biopsy, and asked if I could make an appointment. And dear, compassionate, no-mucking-around Miranda said, “Could you come in the day after tomorrow?” People, I work in healthcare. And I can tell you from vast experience that the behemoth tanker that is the healthcare system is not noted for its quick response time. It’s practically unheard of for a person to get an almost-immediate appointment in this state with a new and busy physician. Usually requires someone like Albert Schweitzer to refer you. Never happens with a self-referral. Except this time. Needless to say, I was impressed. Miranda continued, through our nearly four-year acquaintance, to respond thusly. I didn’t always need immediate action, but when I did, Miranda would supply it, without my having to explain why. We should seriously clone Miranda. Today, I explained to Miranda that I was not following my former surgeon, Miranda’s former boss, to her new practice, and that I needed my old file to be faxed to my new surgeon. “We use an outside file-copying service for that,” she told me, “and there’s a small fee. I don’t know how much it is, but I’ll find out for you.” “No problem,” I said. “Do you mind,” she then said, “if I ask you why you decided to switch doctors?” “No, not at all.” Whereupon I proceeded to explain that my former surgeon seemed wonderful at my first visit, and that her surgical technique was clean and competent, but that our relationship went downhill after surgery and never recovered. I wasn’t sure why, I said, but she just never really seemed to listen to me or help me sort out my post-treatment issues, and I always ended up feeling like she couldn’t wait to get me out of her office. It was especially hard during my first year after treatment, I explained, because it was a very bad year, and I had a lot of treatment side effects and a few recurrence scares. And we never found our way to any real rapport. Whenever you divulge some part of the hellish nightmare of cancerland to someone who hasn’t heard it before, you can’t help reliving it emotionally. I managed to keep talking to Miranda, but all the betrayal and panic and helplessness I felt during that first year post-treatment got wedged in my throat. “Oh, Kathi, I’m so sorry,” Miranda said with solemnity. “That must have been so disappointing for you.” “It was,” I choked out. “But,” I continued, “I want you to know that I have always appreciated how helpful and kind and conscientious you have been. Thank you for that, Miranda. You really helped make a bad time a lot easier for me.” “Listen,” she said. “I’m going to copy your file right now and send it out, no charge.” After a week or two filled with the Pavlovian-like anxiety reflex of gearing up to meet two new breast cancer doctors (the other one was a plastic surgeon with whom I discussed fat grafting) and having to tell them my sorry tale, mixed with the errant asshattery I’ve encountered from people who call themselves my friends and should really know better by now, I did what any resident of cancerland would do after such a conversation. I folded up my cellphone, sat in my car, drank a large Swiss chocolate iced coffee, and cried my eyes out. So much for equilibrium. Thus, for anyone out there who is not a cancerland resident or who is not Miranda and thus doesn’t get it, here are a few declarations, in case you blocked them out the first or seventeenth time around, or just thought perhaps I was making it all up. No, I am not ‘all better.’ Yes, I am still slogging my way through fatigue and low energy three-and-a-half years later. No, it’s not as bad as it was. Now, it’s less like being run over by a freight train and more like being flattened by the occasional stray eighteen-wheeler. Yes, my concentration just sucks sometimes. And my train of thought sometimes derails unexpectedly. Although I can still usually find my way home. When #2 or #3 are bad enough, I have to stop what I’m doing. Immediately. Not when it’s convenient for you. I am working part-time not by choice, but out of necessity due to #2, 3 and 4. That means I pay all my old bills with 1/5 less income. So if I say I can’t afford it, I can’t afford it. Period. That also means that saying, ‘Why don’t you just hire someone to [fill in the blank with exertional life/home/yard task] for you?’ is not a helpful suggestion. That also means that suggesting I should get more physical therapy for my chronic cording/arm/shoulder/chest pain is about as helpful as baying at the moon, because it involves a $500 out-of-pocket deductible and an average $30 co-pay for each visit, which I can’t afford. Besides which, it’s almost pointless, because no matter how much physical therapy is done on me, the problem always comes back. It always comes back because radiation damage is permanent. P-E-R-M-A-N-E-N-T. Write that down and stop bugging me. If you really give a shit, how about buying me a hot tub? No, I cannot work ‘some extra time’ to make up for my lost income. I can barely scrape out my part-time hours. That’s P-A-R-T time. See #2, 3, 4, 5 and 8. When I make plans to hang out with you so we can catch up after not seeing each other for a while, that doesn’t mean it’s okay to bring your secretary/sister-in-law/new boyfriend/other-person-I’ve-never-met-before to tag along without asking me beforehand so that maybe their presence will mean I won’t talk about cancer. Guess again. This is where I live and I’ll talk about whatever I damn well please. And if you don’t like it, don’t make plans with me. No, I am not cured. I am NED. There’s a difference. Look it up. No, I will not explain any of this to you again. The next time you don’t understand something, I suggest you RMFB, which stands for ‘Read my ___-ing blog.’ Ahhh…I feel much better now.

217,26,53,19,6,2012,2012-06-19,"Published at: 02:06 pm - June 19, 2012 One sure-fire way to get the ‘real’ scoop on a surgeon is to talk to some homecare clinicians. Just ask a few homecare nurses — who change messy surgical dressings, negotiate wound-vacs and drains, treat surgical infections — which surgeons do a good job and which ones leave an ungodly mess behind, and believe me, they’ll tell you. At length. Or ask someone like me, a homecare physical therapist, who also changes dressings now and then, who helps people with post-op pain and impaired mobility, who has to mobilize scar tissue, and you’ll get another earful. Or you might talk to a few healthcare clinicians who have been surgical patients. Especially other physicians who’ve been patients. Oh, my! You’ll definitely get the unvarnished 411. You’ll get a veritable treatise on a given doctor’s diagnostic skills, bedside manner, surgical technique, pre- and post-op care. You’ll also, more than likely, get some damn good snark. I’ve had the most hilarious, snarky and edifying conversations with physician friends about other physicians. So, when several clinicians have good things to say about another doctor, based on personal experience, you can pretty much take that to the bank. Thus it was that I visited such a surgeon today to have a slightly-overdue breast cancer check-up. I wish I could tell you his name, because it’s a lovely, mellifluous one. Sounds more like the name of an opera composer than a surgeon. But I’ll just call him Dr. C. Long-time readers of this blog know that I have felt disenchanted for a while now with my original breast surgeon. We started out wonderfully, or so I thought, but our relationship rapidly went downhill [See my post Off My Chest for some of the ugly details.]. I’ll give her this much: she gave me her cell phone number during my first visit with her — this was before my biopsy and diagnosis — which impressed me. And although her circumaureolar incision hurt like the fires of hell for months afterward, the scar is now all but invisible and she got nice, clear margins. So, I thank her for that. And she had an absolute angel of a medical assistant, who saved my sanity on more occasions than I care to recall. In fact, I really need to send this young woman some flowers now that I won’t be dealing with her anymore. The thing is, my breast surgeon was my only cancer doc left from the original crew. I ended up cancelling my six-month post-treatment visit with my rad onc, because he turned out to be the most useless, dishonest, unhelpful, uninformative waste of ectoplasm I’d encountered on the journey. So, sayonara to him. I finished with my med onc a year after treatment, when we both decided that the measley 7% decrease in my recurrence risk, that tamoxifen was supposed to confer upon me, was not worth the utter havoc it was wreaking on my life and my body. And, no, I’m not a good candidate for aromatase inhibitors. I like my med onc. I wouldn’t have minded seeing her again, but I’m just as glad I don’t have to. So, ongoing surveillance has been down to my breast surgeon. Whom I’ve considered dumping for a few years now. And then, around March, when I was supposed to see her again for a six-month check-up, I got a letter from her, telling me she was leaving her practice because she’d been asked to head up a new breast health center. Since my primary beef with her is her less-than-stellar adherence to the concept of informed consent, not to mention her utter lack of compassion on a number of occasions, I took a dim view of her ability to head up such a center. The only thing that might have persuaded me to follow her there was if her wonderful medical assistant was going with her. But, alas, she was not. So, here was my opportunity to ditch her once and for all. Enter Dr. C of the mellifluous name. And of the sterling rep among us clinicians. He is a general surgeon, truth be told. If you have a hernia that needs repairing, he’s your man. I can vouch for his skills on this, because he once repaired two hernias for a former boyfriend of mine, both of which healed beautifully and did not hinder in the slightest my ex-paramour’s romantic exertions. (We broke up for other reasons.) A year ago, Dr. C performed an emergency gall bladder removal on one of my best friends, who is one of the aforementioned homecare nurses I used to work with. She has seen it all, and mopped up some surgical hack jobs in her time. But when she got to the emergency room last year, she made it crystal clear that the only surgeon she’d let within 50 miles of her gall bladder was Dr. C. I was with her in the ER that day, as well as after her surgery, and Dr. C was a prince throughout. Here in our local area, we do not, thank goodness, have so many women requiring breast cancer surgery as to warrant an attending specialist at our local hospital. But one of Dr. C’s surgical specialities is breast cancer surgery. Which he has ably performed on a few friends and colleagues. He attends the conferences, reads the research studies, and works with our local breast health center, which was not, sadly, fully up and running when I was diagnosed, else I might have availed myself of their services. I have cared for a number of Dr. C’s post-op patients. His surgery is clean and competent. His scars are a thing of beauty. As a person, he is a clean-cut, fit, energetic professional. He exudes competence. His manner with his patients is no-nonsense yet compassionate. He is never patronizing. He does not presume to make your decisions for you. He provides thorough advice and answers questions and he doesn’t make you wait for results and call-backs. He’s not what you’d call warm and fuzzy, but he’s a straight-shooter, has a dry sense of humor, and he is not above being kidded. If you get him to laugh or crack a smile, it makes your day. Plus, his staff are lovely. Always a priority with me. So, this morning, I visited him. My now-former breast surgeon’s office had not yet faxed him my file, so I got to tell him the highlights of my sorry tale in appropriate medicalese. He listened respectfully, took notes, appreciated my clinical reportage. During his exam, he found nothing suspicious in my breasts. He wrote me a prescription for my next mammogram, which is due in August. He told me that if it’s negative, I don’t need to see him again for a year. We gabbed a bit about last year’s ASBS Conference, which he attended. He didn’t go to this year’s. “Lot of redundancy at these things if you go every year,” he said. “I read the highlights. A lot of it is esoteric. If a patient of mine needs that level of care, I refer her to a specialist.” We talked about my decision to stop tamoxifen and my recurrence risk. “You’re right,” he said. “They told you it would reduce your risk by 50%, when for you, it’s really only 7%.” [Absolute risk vs. relative risk, one of my pet peeves.] “Never mind that you already had an 85% chance of having no recurrence. Statistics can be presented to scare people. They make it sound like your risk is worse than it is. A lot of statistics are just bullshit anyway.” We talked about radiation and cording and chest wall spasms and scar tissue. “Your skin looks great,” he said. “But I know the interior tissue is probably a mess. Sometimes I have to do biopsies on irradiated breast tissue, and it’s like trying to cut through cement.” I told him that, as a PT, I know what to do for it, and do exercises every day, but it’s still problematic. “Yes,” he said, “radiation damage stays with you. I try to convince my patients that it’s important to stretch every day, but some of them don’t do it. And then they can’t pick up their arms at all.” We talked about recon. “You could get a small implant that doesn’t have to be inserted under your pectoral muscle,” he told me, “if you care about the volume loss.” I told him I’d talked to a plastic surgeon last week about fat grafting. “And I don’t really care that much about symmetry,” I said. “Just as well,” he said. “I’d hate to tell you how many times I’ve had to remove implants because of scar tissue, or I have to take them out so a patient can get radiation, then try to put them back in. It’s a mess,” he said. “The less surgery, the better,” he added. “Besides, I think you look good the way you are.” This last was said without a trace of innuendo, simply as a statement of medical fact. That’s how he is. He doesn’t waste words. Whatever he says, he says as an experienced doctor. And you feel like you can take it as gospel. So, I thanked him, shook his hand again, and went home. I can’t tell you how reassuring it was to be on the receiving end of his stolid, business-like candor. My next mamm notwithstanding, I went home feeling safer than I’ve felt in a long time. Thanks, Dr. C. I’m glad you’re on my side.

218,26,54,12,6,2012,2012-06-12,"Published at: 07:06 pm - June 12, 2012 Fuhgeddaboudit. Sometimes, the best thing a doctor can tell you is what she won’t do. Such was my experience today. I’ve returned from my consult with the plastic surgeon I vetted recently per my previous post, Private Parts: Breast Recon Without Surgery. Dr. S turned out to be a delightful, intelligent, conscientious person, and she said no. Yes, she does do lipotransfer — but only for patients who’ve had full mastectomies, and hence, no breast tissue left that might develop a recurrence. She does it to help correct imperfections resulting from reconstructive flap graft and/or implant surgeries. In fact, she is hoping to participate in a clinical trial of the BRAVA technique, a post-mastectomy reconstruction option that uses autologous fat transfer to construct an entire breast, thereby eliminating the need for surgery altogether. It’s still complicated, and Dr. S explained that she is not without her reservations about BRAVA. But that perhaps makes her the ideal type of surgeon to explore a new procedure, because she’s got a healthy dose of skepticism and thus doesn’t have an agenda to prove that it’s safe. From the get-go, Dr. S acknowledged that lipotransfer is a hot topic in breast recon, but a controversial one. Many more types of research studies, she felt, including longitudinal ones, are needed about simple lipotransfer in general, and stem-cell boosted lipotransfer in particular. She referred to recent studies that question the safety of both. Of particular concern is the use of lipotransfer in women who’ve had partial mastectomies or lumpectomies or radiation. Fat grafts can lead to abnormal mammograms and the development of calcifications, even in women who have lipotransfer as part of non-cancer-related breast augmentation. There is also concern that the stem cells in any fat transfer might facilitate the growth of new breast tumors. “The thing is,” she said, “stem cells can turn into anything.” So, for someone like myself, with a partial mast and radiation, then, no, Dr. S would not perform lipotransfer. “I know plastic surgeons who’d do it, who’ll try anything,” she said, “but I’m not one of them. I don’t want to contribute to a possible recurrence.” “Well,” I said, “that actually makes me like you more as a surgeon.” We discussed clinical trials, and she gave me a few names of plastic surgeons who might be able to tell me more about research and the state of lipotransfer safety. We agreed about my decision to avoid flap surgery and implants, about the long-lasting effects of breast radiation, and how unarguably nasty radiation can be. We talked about my area of expertise — post-op rehab. She told me about her office partner, who is a specialist in hand surgery and restoration. Their office employs a group of rehab therapists who do nothing but work with post-op patients who’ve had hand surgery to help them restore their fine motor function. I told her about the Monday night #bcsm (breast cancer social media) Tweetchats. She took my email address and we promised to stay in touch. It’s reassuring to feel like I talked to the right person, a doctor whose primary concern was doing the right thing for me, which meant not doing the wrong thing. If her surgical technique and her patient care are as conscientious as the conversation we had today, I’ll bet Dr. S is a great recon doc. If you live anywhere near Providence, RI, and you’re looking for someone, send me an email at kk@accidentalamazon.com, and I’ll give you her contact info. Weird Synchronicity. As fate would have it, when I returned home, I found that a blog sister had posted a link about something called the Breast Cancer Patient Education Act. From the link: “Bipartisan legislation introduced in the House of Representatives on June 8 would require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to plan and implement an education campaign aimed at informing mastectomy patients of breast reconstruction availability and coverage, and of prostheses and other replacement options.” On the face of it, I think this is a good thing, although I hope this campaign is going to include those of us whose options may also include lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. According to studies, “only 33 percent of eligible women with breast cancer undergo breast reconstruction – and published research shows that nearly 70 percent of women are not informed of their care options.” I was certainly one of those women who was not told about all my treatment options or their risks and side effects. It’s sad that we have to consider legislating something like this at all, because one would hope that doctors know they’re supposed to adhere to the principle of informed consent by providing full info in the first place. Except that all too often, they don’t. One of the first posts I wrote about this thorny subject was called Blind-Sided: Cancer 101 & Informed Consent. However, in the ‘No good deed goes unpunished’ category, well-intentioned legislation often leads to unintended consequences. The breast cancer awareness behemoth has amply demonstrated over and over how many groups and corporations are ready to make a buck off breast cancer. Let’s not forget that National Breast Cancer Awareness Month was launched largely by AstraZeneca, maker of several breast cancer drugs. Thus, it should come as no surprise whatsoever that the American Society of Plastic Surgeons has hopped right on this potential gravy train. Together with the Plastic Surgery Foundation, the ASPS plans to launch the first-ever National Breast Reconstruction Awareness Day, on October 17th of this year. Naturally, this inexorably led to a handy acronym, which is — yes, you guessed it — National BRA Day. The performer Jewel has agreed to serve as the spokesperson for this event, and has reportedly written a song about breast recon patients. She plans to premier it on October 29th, at a charity event to be held in New Orleans during the annual meeting of the ASPS, otherwise known as Plastic Surgery 2012. From the many, many stories I’ve heard, and the post-op patients I’ve treated, some of the worse offenders in the lack-of-full-disclosure sweepstakes are plastic surgeons. For my previous thoughts on this subject, here’s my post, Under Construction: An Alternate View. So, no, despite Dr. S, I do not trust the ASPS to provide full and complete info about recon and its risks. My fantasy guerilla action would be to show up at Plastic Surgery 2012 with Florence Williams, and hand out copies of her chapter on the ugly history of breast implants and augmentation surgery, from her book, Breasts — A Natural and Unnatural History. [My review of Williams’ book is here.] Or maybe force the attendees to watch Pink Ribbons, Inc. while they’re noshing on tidbits prepared by Emeril Lagasse. Already, I’m having nightmares that National BRA Day will encourage more of those coy, idiotic Facebook memes about bras that purport to raise breast cancer awareness. If you’re among the two or three women on the planet who don’t know what I’m talking about, I describe them in my post The Pink Elephant. No accident that Plastic Surgery 2012 is being held in New Orleans, the home town of the storied Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, often referred to simply as NOLA by recon patients. NOLA is where a friend of mine had her recon, and developed seemingly every post-op recon complication known to exist. Had I known about BRA Day before I saw Dr. S, I might have asked her what she thought about it. Nothing like having your professional organization make a circus out of the prime focus of your surgical practice. Nothing like making more of a circus out of breast cancer, or a marketing opp out of patient education. Postscript: wanted to add a few links here. I’ll give the ASPS credit for this link to a decent outline on what you need to know before having breast recon. The issue is, as always, how does this get put into practice? Breast Reconstruction I’ll also repeat the link for some recent research about lipotransfer and its risks. Lipotransfer and Safety Concerns Finally, these are the questions I assembled from the wonderful advice and comments on my previous post: Lipotransfer: Questions for your plastic surgeon Posted in: Fighting the Pink Peril, Research, Surgery & Reconstruction by Kathi 25 Comments",0,1,0.12672713884054093
219,26,55,2,6,2012,2012-06-02,"Published at: 01:06 pm - June 02, 2012 First off, massive thanks to all the sistahs out there who commented, shared their stories, and provided excellent advice on my last post about lipotransfer. Once again, I am touched and profoundly grateful for the way that our cyber community steps up to help one another. Without this support, from the beginning of my own rocky road almost four years ago, I would surely have lost my sanity. This kind of validation and generosity is no less real for being delivered in bits and bytes. And then there’s ‘real life.’ One thing that struck me as I was writing my last post is that it represents an internal process that has been going on, slowly, in fits and starts, in my daily life. I hesitate to say this too loudly, but sometimes, for an hour or two, I catch myself feeling almost, maybe, sort of — normal. I’m not sure I remember what the old normal was like. I’m not even sure I can describe this new normal. The fact that I take note of it means that it’s not normal. The old normal was something I scarcely noted, something I took for granted. This new thing is startling, unexpected. It feels something like having the sun pop out after weeks of endless rain and fog. It reminds me of when, at age thirteen, I found out I was nearsighted. I could see what was right under my nose, but I couldn’t bring into focus the details of people and things that were more than twenty-five feet away. When I put on my first pair of glasses, I discovered a new planet. I was the same person, and it was the same planet. But I now had a fresh invitation to participate. Last night, I met an old friend in the big city. We had tickets to a concert. My idea, and I’d checked in with Amy a week before to remind us both of the date. It was a perfect, soft, sunny spring evening. We both found parking spaces near the concert hall, and walked to a French café for dinner. We’ve known each other for over fifteen years, worked together in the trenches of homecare. She was often the nurse case manager for the patients I saw for physical therapy. I watched her son and her daughter grow up, borrowed each of them now and then just for fun, been a kind of surrogate auntie. I’ve watched her struggle with her marriage, especially over the last few years. We’ve been through a lot together. We try to get together at least every few months. While she drank pinot and I slurped French onion soup, we caught up. We kept an eye on the clock, but decided we just had enough time to share a heavenly dish of crème brûlée. We paid our bill and strolled back toward the concert hall. And while we walked, I tried to describe to her how I’d lately discovered these astonishing moments of feeling like myself again, like I’d been allowed to step out of a dark wood and stand in the light, freshened by a warm breeze, and see the world with a lighter heart. It didn’t last long, and the awareness of the dark wood never left. But the relief and peace of these moments was deeply nourishing. Suddenly, Amy stopped and turned to me. There were tears in her eyes. She reached over and hugged me. “I feel like I’ve been a bad friend,” she said. “I can’t even imagine how hard this has all been for you. I wish I could have done more.” “You’re not a bad friend,” I told her. When we got to the concert hall, the lobby was dark and the doors were locked. Puzzled, I pulled the tickets out of my bag and checked the dates. The concert wasn’t going to happen for two more weeks! We looked at each other and laughed. “Brain fog,” I said. “Story of my life.” “This is great!” Amy said. “This means we get to see each other again in a few weeks.” We decided to take another stroll. We were looking for someplace that had a public restroom. We found an outdoor patio next to a swank hotel where a jazz singer was belting out some blues with her back-up band. We listened for a while. The beat was infectious. I even danced a little. We made our way around the patio and into the hotel lobby, where there was an art show on display. We found the restroom, then went back to look at all the photos. They were pictures of the city. The photographer had tried to capture the tall buildings caught in the angled light of dusk. We walked back outside to admire the real thing, gold bouncing and glinting off the rows of windows, sharpening the cornices and pediments. The real thing was better than the art show, even as it invited and challenged the artist in me to record it. I wished I’d brought my own camera as we found our way back to our cars. “I love you, Kathi,” Amy said. “I’m so glad you’re my friend. You’ve been so patient with me, so good to me and to my kids all these years.” “See you SOON!” I said. “Maybe I’ll remember to bring my camera.” “As long as you remember the tickets,” she laughed. Sometimes, these cherished bits of normal just happen. And sometimes now, I try to invite them and keep my fingers crossed that they’ll cooperate. But whenever they happen, I know what they’ve cost. I know they are not normal at all. Maybe they are a temporary reprieve. Maybe they are grace.

220,26,56,30,5,2012,2012-05-30,"Published at: 01:05 pm - May 30, 2012 Well, I must say it’s been nice. By the time I submit my beleaguered breasts for inspection in a few weeks, it will have been six months since I’ve had to expose any private parts to physicians. I had a sinus infection recently that required my primary care doc to look down my throat and in my ears, but that doesn’t really count. If disrobing is not involved, you can at least maintain some sort of dignity. In two weeks, I will be interviewing a plastic surgeon about lipotransfer. I say ‘interviewing’ as if I were researching a magazine article. I wish. I do plan to mention to her that I write a blog about breast cancer and that I will be taking careful note of all her answers so that I might share them here. But this interview will involve exposing my breasts for the umpteenth time, to yet another stranger, and possibly having them photographed, which is a thing plastic surgeons do. The requisite ‘Before’ photo. She will probably also have to poke, prod and squish, and read the dimensions of the surgically-excised tissue formally known as my right breast from the copy of the path report which I will provide. Those dimensions are etched in my brain: 10.5 cm x 5.5 cm x 2.5 cm. Also known as my ‘slabectomy.’ Shortly after my surgery, I made some comparison measurements to other objects just to help me conceptualize how much breast I’d lost. Of course I’m not quite sure if my slabectomy was a perfect rectangle or more of a lopsided wedge. But the dimensions about equal my cell phone, if I had two of them stacked one on top of the other. Or a fresh bar of French bath soap. Or a couple of packages of chewing gum, in the economy size. I’ve eschewed serious consideration of flaps, grafts and implants thus far, for many reasons, chief among them being all the damage caused by radiation. But apparently, there might be another option that doesn’t involve scars or 14-hour surgery. It might not even involve a hospital. Seems that plastic surgeons have been getting quite good at removing adipose tissue via liposuction from one part of one’s body and re-injecting it into breasts that have had slabs removed from them. In other words, recon by lipotransfer. One of its advantages is that prior radiation is not as problematic. In fact, this seems to help soften up adhesions from radiation. Another point in its favor is that breasts end up looking more natural, still possessed of their normal droop, which doctors insist on calling ‘ptosis.’ Personally, I prefer a little droop. I just don’t see myself as the ‘perky’ type. There is a clinical trial being conducted by Dr. Joel Aronowitz, of the Breast Preservation Foundation in California, of a slightly more complex lipotransfer technique. This involves separating some of the adipose stem cells from the fat that is liposuctioned from the donor site — yes, adipose tissue has its own stem cells — then concentrating it, and injecting it with regular adipose tissue into the breast. The idea here is that the stem cells will help preserve the transferred fatty tissue to help create blood vessels nearby that will help the transferred tissue survive. Even without this stem-cell boost, there are stem cells in all ‘good quality’ fat, which can in turn help keep the transferred tissue healthy, but the extra boost may improve that outcome. This stem-cell boost technique has been used successfully in Europe and Japan for some time now. Most of the research findings have been published by a Dr. Yoshimura. But the technique has not yet been approved in the U.S. Hence, Dr. Aronowitz’s clinical trial. In any event, I did some research on plastic surgeons in my area who specialize in breast reconstruction and checked out their web pages. The woman I made the appointment with made the semi-finals for the simple reason that she did not have one of those noisome ‘aesthetic’ websites that some plastic surgeons are wont to have. You know what I’m talking about. Those sites splashed with ‘tasteful’ soft-lit photos of perfect female bodies, artfully arranged in semi-erotic poses, that are certainly Photoshopped and thus do not resemble any body I’ve ever seen nor would especially want to have. Dented, divoted and tattooed though my right breast may be; a body that’s certainly not as buff as it once was, and carrying a few more pounds than it did before I started down this miserable road; still and all I actually like my body. Which is a startling revelation at this juncture. I’ve gotten rather used to my morphology over the years, even fond of it. I’ve learned, through trial and error, how to dress it up or down, and what assets I’ve ever possessed have never involved cleavage anyway, but have tended to attract admirers of legs and long hair. Which is just fine. Not a thing wrong with looking good in a short skirt and high heels now and then, nonchalantly swishing my locks over my shoulder. So, really, it’s quite encouraging to hear myself say that I still like my body, after all this. And I’m not interested in consulting any plastic surgeon with an agenda, shall we say. I have no desire to look younger than I am. I look ‘young’ enough already, thank you very much, thanks to keeping out of the sun, my mother’s genes, and the judicious application of hair color now and then. Restoration I’m open to. Correction of my so-called deficits and imperfections, as defined by some knife-wielder making payments on his BMW, I’m not. Thus I was pleased to find a surgeon with a website that was business-like, medically-oriented and informative. The one I’m seeing made the finals based on the person who answered her phone. I do not suffer front-office morons. I deal with enough of them in my job, which often requires me to call doctors about my patients. And I certainly don’t want to consult a doctor who doesn’t have the wherewithal to hire someone with adequate brain cells to serve as her gate-keeper. When I called this particular office and asked if the good doctor performed lipotransfer for breast recon, it was quite refreshing to be told, “Hang on a second, I’ll ask her right now.” Which was done, with dispatch, and I wasn’t even placed on hold. The answer was, “Yes,” whereupon we booked an appointment. So, dear readers, I’m asking for some help here. I have a few logical questions in mind, but there is that haze that comes over me when I have any doctor’s appointment involving breast cancer. I get a little fuzzy. I forget to look at whatever list I’ve brought with me. I’ll take a Provigil that day — if I remember to — which might help. But tell me, those who’ve never had recon and those who have, what would you like to know about lipotransfer? If you help give me an assignment, I’ll do a better job. Thanks in advance. If I do this, I admit I might miss my prosthesis. It’s been an endless source of amusement over the last few years. But I can still wave it around in public now and then. Just for fun.

221,26,57,23,5,2012,2012-05-23,"Published at: 01:05 pm - May 23, 2012 Breasts — A Natural and Unnatural History by Florence Williams, published by W.H.Norton, 2012. Exhaustively researched and highly readable, science journalist Florence Williams’ latest book describes the remarkable and largely uncharted ecology of women’s breasts. Yes, ecology. Because it turns out that human breasts are in fact a complex and adaptable ecosystem, with a unique ability to tune in and respond to the world around them. But this very ability may now — in this modern world of environmental assault — be our undoing. It’s a sobering message, but Williams delivers it with humor, wit and accessible, relentless candor. Why Do We Have Them? Humans are almost the only mammals whose females have the pendulous, orb-shaped organs known as breasts. Most mammals do not have or need breasts to suckle their young. So, why do we? In the book’s introduction, Williams quotes humorist Dave Barry, who once wrote, “The primary biological function of breasts is to make males stupid.” In her first chapter, she describes how apposite Barry’s observation truly is with respect to much of the research that has been conducted about them. Generations of male researchers have unwittingly demonstrated how much breasts can “make males stupid” by basing most of their scholarly studies — not to mention their informal ones — on the erroneous assumption that humans developed breasts primarily for sex appeal. Study after study set out to ‘prove’ that men liked them and to determine why, but somehow missed their rather more essential purpose, which is to feed human infants. Later studies finally acknowledged their central function — lactation — but researchers still couldn’t seem to agree on why they are shaped as they are. More recent evolutionary and anthropological studies have argued convincingly that they developed their external form and placement to help us have smaller babies with bigger brains, feed them on the run, and help infants develop the gestures, palate structure and oral motor skills necessary for human speech. Most mammals just have exterior nipples, while the milk glands remain interior. But as we stood up and lost our fur, we humans also developed flat faces. So our babies needed an exterior shape that would protrude, allowing them to latch on and suckle. Sorry, guys, but evidently, the sexual appeal of their shape and size is very much secondary to their raison d’être, not to mention technically unnecessary for sexual intercourse. The Milk Miracle Williams proceeds to describe just how remarkable — and still poorly understood — human lactation is. We do know that lacation in animals is eons old. So far, biologists have found that we humans have about 6,000 genes devoted to lactation, and that, in essence, the primary purpose of lactation is to deliver fat-rich nutrition. Mammary glands work in highly sophisticated ways to produce milk that is individualized for each infant and confers immunity, to secrete contraceptive hormones to prevent pregnancy while mothers breast-feed, and to allow infants to develop physical and cognitive skills while they are feeding. Estrogen plays a key role in managing this remarkable process. Of necessity, breasts evolved the ability to absorb estrogen not only from other parts of our bodies, but from external sources, like the plants and animals we eat. Unfortunately, they did not develop the ability to avoid absorbing some nasty, artificial estrogen-like chemicals from our environment. At puberty, estrogen and other hormones help girls develop the tree-like system of milk ducts that underlies the rounded structure of emerging breasts, by switching on a massive process of ductal cell proliferation. Understanding how humans start and stop this cell proliferation in puberty may lead to treatments for that other abnormal type of cell proliferation — breast cancer. Is Bigger Really ‘Better’? According to the research Williams cites, there is no conclusive evidence that bigger breasts gave members of our species any evolutionary advantages back in the mists of time. Bigger breasts are no better at making milk than small ones, nor do they make more of it. No matter what size they are, the average new mother produces 16 ounces of milk in each breast in 24 hours. There is also no universal, cultural consistency in the average size and shape of breasts. In general, in first world cultures, a nicely rounded, modest B cup has been the average size for decades. Yet this notion that ‘bigger is better’ has been around for a very long time, as have all manner of external breast enhancements, from corsets to ‘cupcake’ inserts. But the idea of making breasts bigger from the inside is fairly recent. According to the American Society for Aesthetic and Plastic Surgery, in 2011, almost 317,000 women had breast augmentation surgery, making it the most popular plastic surgery among women, followed by tummy tucks (almost 150,000) and contrasted with breast reduction surgery (about 113,000). The average breast augmentation surgery results in a C cup. Boobstagrams However ambiguous the motives may be for increasing breast size, the history of surgical augmentation is ugly, dangerous and driven by greed. In the past century, surgeons have inserted everything from paraffin to wood chips into women’s breasts to make them bigger, usually with deadly or disfiguring results. In the late 1950’s, the first implants came along. The early ones were something like sponges, made of polyvinyl and polyethylene, and containing formaldehyde. Then came silicone, which was initially used to insulate airplane parts and lubricate machinery, and later for paints, adhesives and medical tubing. By the early 1960’s, the popularity of silicone breast implants was fostered by plastic surgeons who pathologized “limited” breast size by referring to “small” but normal breasts as “micromastia.” Even in 1982, the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery referred to small breasts as ‘deformities.’ By the early nineties, the health problems resulting from implants, and the carcinogenic ingredients some contained, exploded across the news, resulting in law suits and massive recalls. Despite the so-called safer implants now produced, they continue to result in health problems like capsular contracture, while quality control and manufacturing safety continue to be questionable. Unhealthy Assets The next several chapters are even more alarming. The adaptive marvel that is the ecology of our breasts turns out to be a barometer of the environmental pollution that saturates our lives. Pesticides, plastics, and some of the chemicals used to manufacture them contain substances that are artificial estrogens. Bisphenol A, aka BPA, is one of them. Then there are drugs that act on our endocrine systems, like the infamous DES. There are artificial growth hormones and antibiotics in cows’ milk. There is mercury in our fish. There are phthalates in beauty lotions and shampoos. There are flame-retardants everywhere. The list is endless. One of the scariest things about these substances is that we — and our breasts — absorb them even if we manage to avoid ingesting them in our food and drink. When they don’t act like estrogen, some of these substances act like aromatase, an enzyme that converts other hormones into estrogen. Others can disrupt our endocrine systems and normal genetic signalling. Our furniture, our cars, our computers, our cellphones, the predominance of our product packaging, all contain these chemicals and polycarbonates. According to Williams’ research, about “one thousand chemicals” in our everyday products have been found “to alter animal endocrine systems.” In the U.S., new products may be manufactured without testing them for their affect on the human body. When the author herself had her own breast milk analyzed by a laboratory, she was shocked to find out how much flame-retardant, among other things, turned up. Later, she and her seven-year-old daughter also submitted urine samples for toxicology analysis, both before and after a three-day attempt to avoid as many potential chemicals and plastics as possible. The results demonstrated just how ubiquitous these products are and how close to impossible it is to completely eschew them. It’s not easy to determine exact correlations between these environmental toxins and their precise affects on our biology. But research has documented that the onset of puberty in girls is occurring earlier and earlier. For decades, the average age of puberty in the U.S. had been about 13 or 14. In 1997, one study found that the mean age in American girls for breast development and pubic hair had lowered to 9.8 years in Caucasian girls, and 8.8 years in African American girls. Meanwhile, other researchers have scrambled to examine the relationship between early puberty and breast cancer risk, the carcinogenic affect of individual toxins on breast cancer development, and the relationship between all these artificial estrogens and obesity, puberty and breast cancer. Mother and Child Williams goes on to a frank discussion of our conflicting notions about breast-feeding. Its history, like many other areas of our female reproductive lives, has been fraught with controversy, needless medical interference, myth, misinformation and neglect. From wet-nurses to deadly recipes for infant formula to breast pumps; from the immunity conferred by breast milk, to the toxins passed along in it, breast-feeding today can seem both miraculous and dangerous. Breast milk as a substance is still far from thoroughly understood. And few scientists comprehend the mechanism by which we produce it. Nor does it always come ‘naturally.’ Not every woman can or wants to breast feed, and thousands of children, at least in modern times, have managed to grow up to be healthy adults without it. Baby formula, however, has its own unseemly history. But as researchers understand more about real breast milk, we may be able not only to produce better, safer infant formula, but develop some of its ingredients to help fight cancer. Breast Cancer & the Bottom Line The last chapters in the book address the myriad vagaries of breast cancer. A particularly moving chapter addresses male breast cancer, and the cluster uncovered among Marines at Camp Lejeune, “the largest cluster of male breast cancer ever identified.” Other chapters are devoted to HRT, aging, and breast cancer incidence; to breast density, BRCA mutations, and the drawbacks of current screening tools. There is even an edifying revisit with formal breast self-exams, in which the author used a scientifically-engineered breast-model, with instructions that are very different from the old shower-card instructions with which many of us are familiar. Even with practice, Williams did not find it easy or necessarily helpful. But once again, the bottom line seems to be that, however we do it, we should spend some time getting to know our own breast geography. The overriding theme of this informative book is to place human breasts in their evolutionary, ecological, social and biological context. And to outline an urgent call to action. The more we understand breasts, in all their complexity, the more we realize that the task of curing and preventing breast cancer has reverberations that affect all of society. Yet, Williams writes, even when prevention is “broadly defined to include early screening,” only 7% of the National Cancer Institute’s budget is spent on prevention. Our basic screening tool — mammography — has not changed in its essence in over half a century, while radiation itself is the one absolutely proven environmental cause of breast cancer. Meanwhile, despite the fact that the bulk of the NCIs budget is spent on treatment research, the treatment of breast cancer still involves the old ‘slash/burn/poison’ protocol, with all its collateral damage. As the author discovered personally, better lifestyle choices can only take us so far. Until manufacturers make safer products, until corporate farms produce foods that are free of toxins, until the assessment and regulation of chemicals is more rigorous, we are all at risk.

222,26,58,9,5,2012,2012-05-09,"Published at: 01:05 pm - May 09, 2012 I’m not complaining. Not really. Maybe a little. This is the last day of my vacation. I’d been looking forward to it for weeks. Sixteen lovely days off from my job as a homecare physical therapist. Sixteen days when I did not have to figure out how to solve someone else’s health problems, when I did not have to open my work laptop and spend more time than I like documenting how I attempted to solve someone else’s health problems instead of just solving them. Sixteen days when I could do whatever I wanted, or nothing at all. I had plans, recreational ones. No plans to see any doctors. Just a few plans to have some fun, see a few friends. Not such a big deal on the face of it, but making plans to have fun is something it’s taken me a few years to get back to since being diagnosed and treated for cancer. Mostly, I had planned to spend a good portion of these sixteen days helping myself feel better, feel good, feel sort of normal. I planned to relax, to eat well, to read, to get outside, to delight in going to sleep without an impossible work day hanging over my head. I planned to drink coffee only when I felt like it because I love the way it tastes, not to have to drink it to get myself going in the morning. I planned not to have to take Provigil to get through the day. I planned to go for walks, to stretch every day, to gently ramp up the sporadic exercise I manage to squish into an average week. I planned to perhaps get myself over this invisible hump I’ve been living with for three-and-a-half years, the not-normal-anymore hump. And if I didn’t quite get over it, I was hoping perhaps to redefine the hump a little, just maybe to chisel down its dimensions to make it fit my current circumstances. I didn’t make it. Not even close. During my first weekend off, I had a close encounter with a two-year-old with a flagrantly symptomatic head cold, and I succumbed. I ended up spending most of the rest of my vacation in bed, drinking fluids, taking vitamins and anti-inflammatories and various other over-the-counter medications. I took my temperature a lot. I dragged myself to the store and bought boxes of tissues. I refilled my prescription inhaler when post-nasal drip kept clogging up my windpipe. I listened to my lungs to make sure I wasn’t developing bronchitis. I didn’t, thank goodness. I felt a little better every day, but not a lot. After a week, I hauled myself to my doctor’s office, confirmed that I did not indeed have bronchitis, just a stubborn sinus infection, and got an antibiotic. After three days of that, the glue in my sinuses is finally starting to let up. I’m not coughing. I’m finally starting to breathe like a normal person, but I’m worn out. Tomorrow I have to go back to work. Could have happened to anyone, I realize. I get exposed to lots of fierce germs in my job and don’t get sick. But I don’t often get exposed to small children, who do, let’s face it, seem to spread their own particularly contagious brand of germ warfare like brush fire. But I can’t help wondering if I was at a disadvantage. Because I’ve spent so much of the past three-and-a-half years feeling like a dishrag, remembering with sheer amazement how vigorous and positively rippling with vitality I used to feel before cancer. I’ve spent so much of my time since adjusting, lowering my expectations; trying to accept how I feel now, trying not to compare how I feel now with how I used to feel before cancer; trying to remind myself that how I feel now is, in fact, better than how I felt six months ago, or a year ago, or three years ago. And feeling encouraged by that. It’s just that the not-normal-anymore hump is always in the way. Yes, I’m a few years older. Can’t blame that on cancer. In fact, because of cancer, I’m frankly relieved and delighted to be a few years older. It seems, though, that everything else about how I feel now is, directly or indirectly, related to cancer. Feeling broke, feeling out-of-shape, feeling like my energy is always limited; feeling overwhelmed by how many mundane, pedestrian, household tasks are beyond my ability to keep up with; feeling pain in my right shoulder and chest every day; seeing a body that looks different, that doesn’t fit my clothes the way it used to; acknowledging the fact that my priorities have changed and still are changing, that it doesn’t take much to throw me right under the fatigue bus. Feeling a kind of weary, grudging acknowledgement that all of this is, in one way or another, the result of having and being treated for cancer. Other stuff might have happened to create this not-normal-anymore hump. It just happened to be cancer that happened. I’m not even depressed about it, which, given my history of depression, is nothing short of astonishing. In fact, I count that as one of the blessings I’ve been reminding myself to count these last few weeks. I’m glad I have a job to go back to tomorrow. I’m glad I have paid vacation time. And health insurance. And a lovely doctor who is my friend, and with whom the other day, I laughed about how we’ve both passed one of those milestone ages that ends in a zero, how we both still find ourselves thinking things and liking things we thought and liked thirty years ago, in an older body we are sometimes astounded to discover still harbors these younger preferences. I’m glad I have a roof over my head. And got to read lots of books and blogs by friends. I even managed to start a new blog and write a few blog posts. And I got to snuggle a lot with my cats, who make me laugh at the fact that they are perhaps the two beings on this earth who regard my being sick in bed as a boon. And I’m glad that my immune system is still, albeit slowly, capable of helping me get rid of this cold. So, it hasn’t been the vacation I planned. But life, as I’ve so often been reminded these past few years, is what happens when we’re making other plans. And I have another vacation in October. And the dozens of tissues I’ve used during this one haven’t been for crying. And I’m still dancing with NED, as far as I know. And I’m trying to convince myself that that’s good enough. And that maybe I don’t have to blame something when it’s not. When we don’t feel good, is it always cancer’s fault?

225,26,60,2,5,2012,2012-05-02,"Published at: 03:05 pm - May 02, 2012 This past week has been a varied one, to say the least. I’ve just finished the first of my two weeks off from work, and while I’ve enjoyed much of it, it has hardly been restful. On the face of it, there was nothing inherently unrestful about the few plans I had made for the week. It’s just that life decided to throw a few several spanners into the works. And my plans ended up including more challenges than I could have anticipated. No Good Deed Goes Unpunished First, I set myself the task of starting a blog for METAvivor. This project grew out of a desire to honor the memory of my friend Rachel, by contributing something useful to an organization she believed in and supported. Her post Trying to Stay Alive on Two Percent, includes an essay by guest-blogger CJ Corneliussen-James, president and founder of METAvivor. The two percent refers to the meager percentage of all cancer research funds that are devoted to all Stage IV cancers, to treating it effectively once it has been diagnosed. One of the primary missions of METAvivor is to raise money to fund research that directly addresses metastatic breast cancer. I don’t have the odd fifty or a hundred thousand dollars laying around, else I would have gladly donated it to METAvivor. But I do have a useful commodity — namely, a certain amount of geekitude — that I was happy to offer. Thus, after due discussion with CJ, I agreed to help them launch the METAvivor Blog. I expected to perform a bit of laborious wrangling with WordPress and my webhost. What I didn’t expect was that, during my first try, somehow the WordPress platform didn’t load properly. Plus, one of the plugins that came with it blocked the ability to leave comments. Plus, my webhost experienced some unexplained server crash, which prevented thousands of North American bloggers and website managers from accessing our blog and site email, databases, etc. and so forth, for three very long days. Finally, after spending untold hours trying every geek fix I could come up with, I had to completely deactivate the first launch attempt and start over, from scratch, with a slightly different domain name. Words cannot express the metaphorical hair-pulling this entailed. However, the second attempt worked. I just couldn’t check the blog’s emails for a few days, but at least I could sign in to the blog dashboard. And Facebook was still working. Fasten Your Seatbelts… So, that was the first three days of my vacation. Then, I had to hurry up and pack to go away to Nantucket for the weekend, to partake of the annual Daffodil Festival Weekend. This journey was planned with a sister breast cancer veteran, Cindy, who grew up on Nantucket. We are both Massachusetts natives in fact, although we both now live in other parts of New England. A friend of hers who still lives on the island generously provided us with round-trip ferry tickets and a place to stay. The Daffodil Festival is timed each year to coincide with the blooming of said flower, which grows in profusion on Nantucket. Except this year, southern New England experienced its daffodil days about three weeks early. So, on Nantucket, actual growing daffodils were thin on the ground, but fortunately, there are silk daffodils, and millions of them were employed to decorate the classic cars, hats, people and dogs that participate in the parade that starts on Main Street, and culminates in a massive tailgate party with all manner of picnics and refreshments. However, first we had to get to Nantucket. The sun was shining, but our ferry ride was beset by gale force winds. Which means the water was choppy. And there are no seatbelts on ferries. The one good thing to be said was that we were on a high-speed ferry, which meant that instead of the usual three-hour agony, our trip took only an hour. But it was an hour of heaving and fog and huge waves lathering the windows. And the early-warning symptoms of incipient seasickness — a bit of vertigo and a headache that makes you feel like the top of your head is going to explode. Sigh. The photo below was taken from the ferry window. It’s as good a metaphor as any for the ups and downs of this past week. Blessedly, our dear and generous hostess took us out for dinner that night, to a splendid restaurant. And the next morning, we visited her local health club, and got to soak all vestiges of our turbulent transport in the hot tub. Ahhhh. Next came the festival itself. Lots of color and local characters, beautiful classic cars, and the odd gale force winds, blowing off the cold water, which had everyone holding their daffodil hats while buttoned up in fleece and quilted jackets. Plus an encounter with an unpleasantly officious parade organizer who was bent on ruining our picnic. We didn’t let her, but it was a near thing, involving a sensible parade official, a politely cheerful police officer, and a lot of private cussing. Finally, we finished our picnic and found our way to a flower shop, to get a few memorial bouquets. When she was just nine months old, Cindy and her eighteen-year-old mother were among the 34 passengers and crew on a small plane that crashed in trees near Nantucket Airport one August night in 1958. Cindy was one of the 12 who survived. Her mother was among the 22 who did not. Years later, Cindy researched and wrote a moving book about the crash, called Out of the Fog. We placed one bouquet at the memorial plaque honoring all those who died that night. Cindy placed the second on her mother’s grave. Later, after a much-needed nap, our hostess gathered some old and new friends to her home for a cookout. It was too cold to hang out by the fire pit, so we scarfed up dinner mostly inside. One of Cindy’s old friends at the party was a woman who was making her first social outing since finishing chemotherapy for lung cancer. She was in the midst of radiation and was scheduled for surgery to remove one lung. The other lung was, so far, okay. Cindy and I suddenly found ourselves in an impromptu cancer support session. Cancer is cancer, after all, no matter what kind, and we were happy to listen, ask informed questions and share that instant camaradery that occurs among members of the Club. After dinner, my back insisted that I get off my feet, so I found myself unexpectedly snuggled on the couch by our hostess’s very active two-year-old grandson, who was nursing one of those perennial colds that small children seem to have. Somehow, he decided that, for a time, hurtling from one room to the next was not as much fun as looking at a coffee-table book of photographs of humans and their pets, with me providing narration. The photos were taken in countries around the world, with all kinds of people and all manner of pets, from ponies to peregrine falcons. Naturally, this involved a lot of ‘why’ questions from my rapt young companion, which I answered as creatively as I could. I felt a bit like Scheherazade. The next day, we got up early, to begin the long and complicated journey home, from a last walk down Main Street, to the ferry ride, to the drive to the parking lot where I’d left my car, to our parting and respective car trips home — she to New Hampshire, me to Rhode Island. It was, mercifully, less windy, and once we got back to the mainland, it was warmer, too. By the time I got home, I had a sore throat. The next morning, I had my book-browsing companion’s headcold, and spent the following two days in bed. Emotional Weather Oddly enough, the most unexpected part of this past week was not the roller-coaster of the events themselves, but the emotions that arose with them. After working my way through the cyber-adventures involved in launching the METAvivor blog, I found myself missing Rachel and grieving for her all over again. I found myself burdened by unwelcome knowledge about cancer’s toll, by the simple awareness that my geekitude was welcomed by CJ partly because she was relieved to have help from someone who is not living with mets herself. I can’t say I was totally surprised by my feelings, but I was unprepared for their acuteness. They followed me to Nantucket. They were with me while Cindy and I listened to her friend describe her lung cancer experience. They multiplied for us both while she and I put together the memorial bouquets and visited the grave sites. On our way home, we both agreed that perhaps we’d needed a much quieter, simpler weekend, that this one had not provided enough respite from loss and cancer and heartache. What should have been a lark was more of an endurance test. Sounds a lot like life, doesn’t it?

226,26,61,21,4,2012,2012-04-21,"Published at: 10:04 am - April 21, 2012 The Long and Winding Road Despite rumors to the contrary, I don’t get paid to spread snark — and what I like to think is the occasional trenchant commentary — throughout the land. I wish! No. What I get paid to do, four days a week now, is to work as a physical therapist for a home healthcare agency. It wasn’t my first career. When I started down this road, I was in my thirties. I had recently finished my bachelors degree in writing, going to school part-time while I worked full-time, and I was working as an editor for a small, non-profit feminist quarterly magazine (now defunct). Ronald Reagan had been reelected, so we had tons of stuff to write about. It was in many ways my dream job. But, like many of my previous jobs, it was a lot like herding cats and it involved endless meetings. One day, I woke up realizing I had developed a severe and what would turn out to be a life-long case of meetingitis. Somehow, my notions of changing the world and helping people seemed to be unfulfilled by spending hours hashing out the meaning of collectivism while editing atrociously-written and sometimes hand-scrawled submissions. I guess I got a little cynical. I wanted to do something more concrete, more hands-on, more tangibly helpful to someone. And so, I went back to school, took more science classes and eventually got accepted into grad school for physical therapy. All this and health insurance. A lot of you have had physical therapy somewhere along the line, either during your cancer adventure or for some other reason, like the odd sprained ankle or back strain, probably in an outpatient clinic. I did that kind of PT for several years myself, had a good time, met a lot of nice people, learned a lot. But there was always something about home care that drew me. Occasionally, I suspect that I was just a glutton for punishment. Mostly, it’s because my mother had home care for the last five years of her life, so I got to see its strengths and pitfalls up close and personal. Home care was my second PT job after grad school, after a stint in subacute, inpatient neuro rehab, the serious stuff, the post-brain injury, profound stroke kind of stuff, the teaching people how to move again from scratch kind of PT. And I loved that, too. And it was a good training ground for home care PT. So I did home care for about four years, then, not by choice, had to take a side trip to outpatient, orthopedic rehab, and then got to come back to work for my old home care agency. And here have I been ever since. Working in home care is not like any other kind of PT. You’re not stuck in one place, for one thing. You get to drive around and you get really good at reading maps and following directions. After a while, your car starts to look like an office on wheels. You meet people’s dogs, cats, parrots, horses, and, around here, you may encounter flocks of unthreatening but wild turkeys and geese, several cows, and assorted bunnies and red foxes. You’re also meeting people who’ve just had something traumatic and life-changing happen to them, who’ve just come home from the hospital after surgery, heart attacks, falls, fractures and cancer. You don’t usually have any other colleagues in there with you, no staff of nurses, doctors, social workers or nurses aides to help you out. You’re on your own, so you have figure out what’s going on as best you can. You ask a lot of questions, listen as well as you can, and try to determine what you can possibly do to help this person, who is hardly at his or her best, to feel better. Later, you might decide you need to call in the troops, and contact their doctors to make sure that a home care nurse or social worker or nurses aide comes in to help sort things out. You do a lot of things that aren’t strictly like standard physical therapy. You listen to heart rates, and lung sounds, and blood pressure. You try to figure out if your patients are taking all seventeen drugs they’ve been prescribed, and what all these drugs are for. There’s almost never just one thing wrong. You need to know if they have diabetes or hypothyroidism or a pacemaker. You need to know if they have anyone who can help them get to the bathroom or wash themselves or buy groceries or take them to their doctors’ appointments. You need to move furniture sometimes, so they don’t trip over something and hurt themselves again. You need to figure out if they’re with-it enough to be safe on their own. You need to persuade them to let you get their thirty-three scatter rugs off the floor. You need to figure out if their spouses or daughters or grandchildren are up to the task of being caregivers, temporarily or forever. You need to make sure their surgical incisions are not bleeding or infected. Most importantly, you need to determine whether they are capable of recovering. The old saying, ‘you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink’ is a very pertinent concept in home care. Then you have to write all this up, in very specific and seemingly endless ways, so that insurance companies will pay for your services. Sometimes, a lot of times, you meet people whose lives are a wreck, who have no family, who live in squalor, who are angry and distrustful, who are poor, who are delusional or have serious dementia, who are addicted to alcohol, who have saved every issue of National Geographic for the last forty years and have them stacked and piled over most of their available floor space. Sometimes, no matter what you do, you can’t help them, because they are incapable of helping themselves. But you still have to try. Sometimes, you go in and find them on the floor, and you have to call the EMT’s and send them to the emergency room. Sometimes, your patients die. Sometimes, you feel like you could write an angry treatise on what’s wrong with our healthcare system. Sometimes, everything goes well and you help people get better. When you’ve lived with post-cancer-treatment fatigue and brain fog for any length of time, sometimes you forget that you have legitimate reasons to feel exhausted at the end of the day. Sometimes you don’t give yourself enough credit for what you actually manage to accomplish before you crawl home and collapse into another stupor. Sometimes, you forget to be grateful you can work at all, and pay your bills with less than your former full-time wage, and the hell with the housework because at least you have a roof over your head and can walk upright without an assistive device. Sometimes, you really need a vacation. Mine starts next Tuesday. Do you give yourself credit for all you do? Are you too hard on yourself sometimes? Have you ever had home care?

227,26,62,14,4,2012,2012-04-14,"Published at: 01:04 pm - April 14, 2012 I thought I’d follow the example of my friend Sarah, who has so often shared the healing power of the flora and peace of her garden allotment in Liverpool on her blog. My own garden has been rather woefully neglected these past few years because of post-treatment fatigue and chronic shoulder problems from radiation. But I have hopes this year to give it some more of the TLC it deserves. In the meantime, I live in the smallest state in the U.S., but a lovely one, full of treasures one might never expect to find. I visited one of them this past week, to celebrate my birthday with another friend, Holly, whose birthday is the day before mine. She and I have something of a tradition of trying to get out and enjoy a — hopefully! — sunny and beautiful spring day during our birthday week. And this year, with a confluence of tremendous luck, we pulled off a perfect afternoon at Blithewold, a late Victorian mansion museum with 35 acres of gardens overlooking Narragansett Bay. First of all, the weather forecast for the day we had picked for our outing was not promising. Rain was in the forecast in the days leading up to it, including the morning of the day itself. But Mother Nature was on our side, and despite the little icon on my Weatherbug widget, the sun broke out and the temperature was delightful. Next, we really wanted to have high tea at Blithewold, which is served in the formal diningroom, but all the reserved seats were booked, with the proviso that a few seats would be available for walk-ins. So, we thought we’d take our chances, get there early and see what happened. And we were able to get the last table available for tea! And it was a lovely, proper tea, with sweet old, mismatched china, hot strong tea in a china pot with a pretty cozy, strawberries and cream, cucumber sandwiches, tiny profiteroles, and lots of other goodies. Thus, suitably fueled, we took a long stroll in the gardens. And what gardens they are! The thing about going to Blithewold this week in particular is that all the daffodils — and many other flowers — are in bloom. And there are acres of daffodils, jonquils, narcissus, every sort of daff cousin in all sorts of shades and sizes, winking in the dappled shade of stately old trees, many of which were flowering themselves. So, without further ado, here is a sampling of what we strolled through, in the gentle April sunshine. First, the mansion itself, from the back yard, as it faces the Bay. Now, for everything else. First, the daffodils. They just go on and on… A lovely Japanese garden, with flowering cherry trees and a lily pond. I love this bench. This seat is planted with several varieties of thyme! “Peony’ tulips. Amazing! There are so many woodland flowers, peeking through the shade. These are hellabores. The view of the Bay from the back of the mansion. Someone is out sailing already. And who can blame them!! There are many more pix I could share, but this post might go on for miles if I did! The best part is that, every month, every season, there are different flowers to see and new gems to discover. If you come for a visit, we’ll go for a stroll there, okay?

229,26,64,3,4,2012,2012-04-03,"Published at: 02:04 pm - April 03, 2012 Tainted Blood? Since having cancer, I think about emergencies and end-of-life issues probably more than other folks. I’m still in the process of getting organized per my previous post, Exit Strategy, trying to plan for potential future health crises, updating my will and my retirement savings plan, giving my friends extra keys to the house, etcetera and so forth. I’m not yet due to renew my driver’s license, but I checked, just in case. And like many other people, I specified myself as an organ donor on my license a long time ago. About a decade or so ago, I met a woman whose ten-year-old daughter developed cancer and liver failure from chemo. Her cancer was in remission, but she desperately needed, among other things, a liver transplant. A donor liver became available, it was a match, the tissue was carefully tested, and the transplant took place. It went well. Her little girl survived, tolerated the anti-rejection meds, began to regain some of her health, and then, unexpectedly, died. Apparently, the liver she had received contained cancer cells. Because her immunity was suppressed by the anti-rejection drugs, her T cells and other cells could not identify and fight these occult cancer cells, so the cells rapidly turned into full-blown cancer, and robbed her young life. They were able to determine that the liver cancer was not mets that might have developed from the cancer she’d been treated for. It more than likely came from the donor. It was devastating. So, I looked at my license, and remembered this little girl. And wondered, would anyone want my organs anymore? I would never, ever want to donate an organ that transmitted a deadly legacy. Do I just forget about donating anything now that I’ve had cancer? I assumed so, but I decided to do a little research. Turns out it’s not as cut-and-dried as I thought. Blood Donation The American Red Cross lists eligibility requirements and other details for blood donation on their site. Some of them surprised me. Did you know that, if you are a woman, in order to donate red blood cells, you have to be at least 5’5″ tall and weigh at least 150 pounds? For other blood components, you have to be at least 17 and weigh at least 110 pounds. Just adding a little edit here, on 4/4, to clarify this a little. If you are female, you don’t have to be 5’5″ or weigh any more than 110 pounds to donate blood; they can use everything — white blood cells, platelets, etc. — but the red blood cells if you are shorter than that or weigh less than 150 pounds. These are also the requirements for the American Red Cross. Many other organizations do blood drives and may have different requirements. The American Cancer Society lists the precautions that apply to cancer patients. From the site: While cancer has very rarely been transmitted through transplants of solid organs such as kidneys, there have been no reports of cancer transmission by blood transfusion. To check this, a group of researchers looked back in time at people who had received blood from donors who had developed cancer within 5 years of giving the blood. They found no increased cancer risk in those who got blood from those who were found to have cancer soon after donating. The ACS states some obvious precautions, that you cannot donate blood if you are being actively treated for cancer, or if your cancer has spread or recurred, or if you’ve had leukemia, lymphoma or Kaposi’s sarcoma as an adult. Otherwise, if you stay cancer-free (meaning, for most of us NED or No Evidence of Disease) for 1 to 5 years after treatment, you can donate blood. If your cancer treatment involved only surgery to remove a non-invasive tumor, then you need only wait until you’ve recovered fully from your surgery. Visit the links for more information. Organ Donation The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintains a website about organ donation. It states that, “There are few absolute exclusions [for organ donation] (such as HIV infection, active cancer, systemic infection) and no strict upper or lower age limits.” According to the American Cancer Society site, the tragic story of that little girl is rare, but not unheard of, for the reasons described. But even if you’ve had cancer, some of your tissue and organs may still be safely donated. Kidneys are often donated from living donors. For other donations, if you have active cancer at the time of your death, your internal organs will not be used, but tissue like skin, bone and the corneas from your eyes may still be safe. The ACS site has links to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which provides details about the process of donating and signing up if you need a donation. Bone Marrow Donation The eligibility requirements for bone marrow donation are, understandably, more restricted. The City of Hope website explains them thoroughly. In general, with few exceptions, you cannot donate bone marrow if you have a history of cancer. However, you can donate bone marrow if you’ve had only basal cell skin cancer or in situ cancers, like DCIS, for example, or one of those lovely in-situ cancerous colon polyps, like the one I had removed early this year [see Dodging Those Cancer Bullets]. Further information about bone marrow donation and transplant may be found at Cancer.Net. Hmm. Since I am evidently so far only a two-time member of the Non-Invasive Cancer Club, I could donate even bone marrow without feeling like I might do more harm than good. Paying It Forward I know a healthcare clinician, a wonderful, endearing and competent woman I’ve known now for about twenty years, whose husband needed a kidney transplant. After screening his family members and checking the donor registry with no success, she decided — despite the odds — to have her tissue evaluated as a possible match. And lo and behold, she was a good match! So, a few summers ago, she donated one of her kidneys to her husband. And today, they are both well and healthy. Pretty incredible. Brings tears to my eyes just thinking about how they must both have felt at their success. You never know, do you? For those of us who’ve had cancer, if we regain some measure of health, we often want more than ever to help someone else stay alive. Many of us are haunted by feeling like we are forever tainted by cancer. Before I researched this post, I couldn’t imagine that any of us could still donate our blood, organs or tissue. It’s good to know that, with suitable caution, we still can. Have you ever donated or received a donation of blood, organs or bone marrow? Do you know someone who has? How do you feel about it now?

230,26,65,21,3,2012,2012-03-21,"Published at: 03:03 pm - March 21, 2012 [Reposted on October 12, 2012.] For a long time, complaining about the long and late-term side effects of radiation was a frequent theme on this blog. I haven’t bitched about being barbecued for a while now. That’s not because everything is just ducky, however. It’s only because (a) I got sick of talking about it, and (b) the problems it has left me with are a daily, constant presence. Oy, already… A little background. First of all, this image here is only partly accurate. Yes, that is a radiation therapy gizmo, also known as a linear accelerator. For all you particle physics geeks out there, yes, linear accelerators are also known as ‘atom smashers.’ This is not a comforting thought when you are lying on the (of course, completely uncomfortable) table, with this massive thing that looks like a huge camera lens focussed on you, shining its little green crosshairs on your breast. That’s the other thing wrong with this image. You are not modestly covered up with a hospital gown. You are naked from the waist up. And the crosshairs are shining on your skin. And it’s cold in there. And you’re usually barely recovered from having some portion of your breast whacked off, so you have a hard time getting your arm over your head. And you have little tattoo dots on you, so they can aim the crosshairs at them before they zap you with death rays. But other than that… Oh, and I actually found a web page describing how to make your own little magnetic linear accelerator at home. But I am NOT including a link. As if… So, about four weeks after half my right breast was surgically removed, I had external beam radiation, for three weeks, per the Vancouver Protocol. This protocol is for patients with early breast cancers that can opt for lumpectomy (which was a slab-ectomy in my case). Standard, old-style radiation protocols call for six to seven weeks of radiation. The Vancouver Protocol uses slightly higher individual doses (called fractions) and cuts the number of visits in half. It also seems to lead to fewer nasty burns while you are having it, because by the time you start turning red, blistering, peeling, glowing in the dark, feeling like you want to bite someone, you’re almost all done. This was true in my case, as far as skin issues were concerned. Of course, no matter what kind of radiation you have, some of the side effects don’t start to show up until radiation is finished. Radiation destroys cell DNA. The basic premise is that cancer cells don’t have the same ability to repair themselves that normal cells do. So, they are hoping that they zap you enough to damage the cancer cells and cause them to die, before they damage too many normal cells. But of course, radiation does damage normal cells, and even if these cells repair themselves, the repairs don’t return them to their pre-barbecued state. This is particularly true for the muscle, tendon, skin, lung, lymphatic and other soft tissue cells that happen to get in the way of the death rays. The repairs our bodies undertake are imperfect; instead of nice, brandy new muscle cells, for instance, the body may end up replacing the damaged tissue with more fibrous tissue that doesn’t act like undamaged muscle tissue. Fibrous tissue isn’t as stretchy. Fibrous tissue sticks to itself, a lovely phenomenon called adhesions. In other words, scar tissue. The scar tissue you see along a healed surgical incision is this kind of stuff. You can’t see the scar tissue that you end up with inside after radiation, but you can sure feel it. I don’t know about your radiation oncologist, but mine was, shall we say, less than informative. And that’s putting it very, very politely. Let’s just say that informed consent was an unknown concept with this dude. Denial he was well acquainted with. Following is a list of problems I developed during, after, and waaaaay after having radiation. I was pretty much told that radiation had nothing to do with nearly any of these problems. But I know better. Research backs me up. So, because my rad onc was essentially a lying sack of unsmashed atoms, the only help I ever got from him for any of these problems was a jar of Silvadene. And actually the nurse gave me that. Radiation Problems: Massive, body-slamming fatigue, which started after the 7th treatment. I haven’t been the same since. Folliculitis; this appeared as a bunch of teeny red blisters that weeped, and all my little skin hairs fell out. Bizarre. Burn, baby, burn. No explanation necessary. Decreased red and white blood cell count, suppression of immune function . This wasn’t even checked by the rad onc. Had to get my primary care doc to order the lab tests. Duh. Massive, extremely nasty respiratory infection by day ten of treatment. Not uncommon. The radiation field is over one side of your upper respiratory system, for one thing, and for another, your immune system is whacked. In the midst of a hospital complex that housed roughly 1600 doctors, no one at this ‘comprehensive cancer treatment center’ was capable of confirming the diagnosis or writing me a prescription for Zithromax. Instead, I had to crawl home, call my primary care doc on a Friday afternoon, beg them to squeeze me in, and get treated. Honestly, I would have even spelled Z-i-t-h-r-o-m-a-x for the rad onc, if that’s what his problem was. Bright red skin, big, blown-up armpit. This occurred about 3 days after I finished radiation. I remember that the armpit theme became a hot (literally) topic with my online radiation group. Sheer, unadulterated misery. At its worst, I couldn’t bear any pressure whatsoever over my barbecued self. All I could do was lie in bed, naked from the waist up, and whimper a lot. Fatigue, fatigue, fatigue. We’re in the post-radiation wasteland from here on out. Swelling, swelling, swelling. More upper respiratory infections. Continuing low red and white blood count, whacked out immune system. Now we’re about nine months post-radiation. Was also on tamoxifen by then, which just added to the fun. Signed up for a research study on post-treatment fatigue for folks with breast and prostate cancer at U-Conn Cancer Center. GOD BLESS YOU, YOU GUYS!! Developed chronic cough and shortness of breath. This was about a year after radiaton. After lots of back and forthing and ass-covering ambiguity and chest X-rays and CT scans, was diagnosed with asthma/acute bronchial inflammation, and told I had scar tissue on the pleural covering of my lung in the radiation field. Pulmonary function tests were, thank heaven, normal. Got drugs. Felt better. Felt pissed off at rad onc all over again. Meanwhile, had slight lymphedema early on, which turned into chronic axillary cording. Oh, goodie. Had bowstrings from my elbow through my armpit and down the right side of my trunk. My chest muscles felt like singed shrink wrap. I couldn’t raise my arm over my head. I had PT for three months. This all started immediately after radiation and continues to this day. Chronic adhesive capsulitis in shoulder, chronic spasms in trunk and chest muscles. My daily nemesis. Wake up every day feeling like my right side has been squashed by an elephant. As long as I stretch, play with my Theraband and take pain meds now and then, I can function. I also had to change my computer mouse for trackball thingy. Weird, occasionally sharp breast pain. Sometimes I get these incredible charly-horse spasms down the front of my trunk, from collarbone to waist, on my right side, when I bend over too quickly to pick something up. Still happens. Intensely nasty. Still have fatigue now and then. More now than then. Still taking neurostimulants. Also still have trouble sleeping well. There’s nothing quite like insomnia when you’re exhausted. Really special. So, there you have it. Well, there I have it. I hope you don’t, but do tell me if you do. All I can say is that you’re not alone. It’s been three-and-a-half years since I finished radiation. Radiation has not, sadly, finished with me. I’ll include a few helpful links below. Some links: Arm & Shoulder Pain After Breast Cancer Shoulder girdle exercises Coming Up for Air — some details about soft tissue pain, lymphedema, cording, and respiratory side effects from radiation.

231,26,66,14,3,2012,2012-03-14,"Published at: 05:03 pm - March 14, 2012 The real cost of having breast cancer — any cancer — is perhaps incalculable. And there is no doubt that having cancer changes your life forever, emotionally and physically. But the financial impact can last long after acute treatment is done, changing your life in ways you could never anticipate. I am hoping that this post will be the first of a number of them to examine various aspects of these costs — the obvious ones and the hidden ones. The purpose of this post is to start the discussion, starting with a look at how much cancer has cost me personally, and expanding it, here and in future posts, to look at how it can affect any of us, as individuals and as members of society as a whole. The costs of cancer are buffeted by so many factors — political, socioeconomic, scientific, spiritual — it would take several books to consider them all. But my motivation comes from discussions I used to have with Rachel, of Cancer Culture Chronicles about what a largely miserable job we do in this country addressing and providing for the real costs of cancer. Because our healthcare access is rooted in a system of employer-based health insurance, it is inherently inequitable. Meanwhile, our so-called social ‘safety nets’ — like Medicare, Medicaid and Disability Income — are under renewed political attack in the current economic climate. Nonprofit organizations can help, but do not come close to making up the economic shortfall that faces low-income and uninsured women and men who are facing cancer, and often do an inadequate job — or no job at all — providing access to their services. Komen’s recent debacle over funding for Planned Parenthood illustrates the spurious politics behind many nonprofits and their stated missions. However you look at the big picture, without clear, straightforward, and simple access to screening, treatment and financial assistance, the most vulnerable people are often the ones that have the hardest time getting what they need and staying alive to get it. To paraphrase a quote by Acumen Fund Founder and CEO, Jacqueline Novogratz, “The problem with philanthropy is that none of the rich people know [any] poor people.” Scraping By Back in December, I wrote a post about how to do estate planning, write a will, specify advanced directives for healthcare, and to plan how you want to leave things when you die. [See Exit Strategy.] I’ve been slowly making my way through the advice I outlined in this post. Just yesterday, I had my second appointment with a professional financial advisor, a good friend of a good friend, who is helping me figure out how to afford to retire someday. Retirement planning is something we all need to do something about. But since having cancer, this has become a much more complex and worrisome concept for me. And yet, I consider myself lucky. I’m lucky because I had a job that comes with health insurance, cancer insurance, and disability insurance when I was diagnosed. I had an affordable roof over my head. I had a car. I had a savings account. I had already been contributing to retirement savings for several years. The scary part was that I was a ‘single head of household.’ It’s just me and my paycheck — and my ability to keep earning that paycheck — that keeps me off the streets. I have no immediate family members still alive. I have no rich aunts who might leave me a trust fund. Whenever I’ve gotten really sick or injured, one of the first things I’ve thought about is whether I can afford it. And frankly, that has often scared me more than the illness or injury itself. However, I’ve been lucky. So far. Relatively speaking. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, it was early cancer. It was non-invasive. My health insurance paid for screening, doctor visits, surgery, radiation, oral chemo. I had paid sick time. I was able to get temporary disability payments. The cancer insurance provided extra funds to help cover unexpected expenses — office visit and drug copays, gas money, paying other people to help keep my house from falling down around me when I couldn’t do anything but sleep. And I was able to drag myself back to work eventually and still do my job. More or less. And I still went broke, ran through my savings, needed to spend money on extra things, extra help, just to get by. Not long after I returned to work, I found I couldn’t keep up. Post-treatment long- and late-term side effects and complications plagued me. I had to cut back my hours to half-time. For a while, I was able to make up for the lost income by using up my sick and vacation time. When that ran out, I scrabbled and crawled my way back to working at 80% of full-time, and changed my status to long-term partial disability. That way, I could start accumulating sick and vacation time again, but it meant my paycheck was now 20% less for the forseeable future. I tightened my belt, cut expenses where I could, lowered a lot of expectations, and resigned myself to living on less — one-fifth less than I was used to. And still I considered myself lucky I could work at all, that I still had a job, and could mostly keep the wolf from the door. Meanwhile, I still wake up with pain every day, caused by scarring from surgery and radiation. My brain still runs out of steam unpredictably. Although my fatigue is much better than it was, even a mildly stressful event can throw me right back under the bus at the drop of a hat. Then there is the ever-present fear of recurrence that whips itself up whenever I have to get a check-up. My house is still a mess, my garden is still neglected, and compared to those innocent days before cancer, I am still out of shape, although I readily admit that I’m better off than a lot of folks. Whenever I want to read a new book or have dinner with friends, I have to calculate whether I can afford it this week. And recent larger expenditures — to fill my fuel-oil tank, get two tires and a brake job for my car, and pay for car insurance — have left me cringing. Cancer has definitely cost me a lot. And continues to. Every paycheck. Every day. Adding Insult to Illness Several of my friends have not been so lucky. I was diagnosed in 2008, a few months before the housing bubble burst and the economy crashed. I’ve lost count of the number of friends who lost jobs right before or right after they were diagnosed, or whose spouses did while they were undergoing treatment. I remember in those early days helping to raise emergency funds for an online breast cancer forum friend whose husband lost his job right before Christmas. She was still undergoing acute treatment. Their mortgage was already astronomical. Now they were in danger of losing their home entirely. We managed to scrape together enough money to help them pay the mortgage for a few months and buy a few Christmas presents for their two little boys. They managed to find a program to help them refinance their home. Her husband was able to find other work eventually. They scraped along by the skin of their teeth. We all know what the last few years have been like for the national and global economy. I still have friends who are unemployed. Who don’t have health insurance. Who never had cancer but suddenly find lumps in their breasts. Who are disabled now and can’t work because of what cancer and cancer treatment has done to their bodies. Every week, someone I know is going broke because of new cancer or old cancer. A recent news story in USA Today examined cancer’s financial toll. In Cancer’s Growing Burden: The High Cost of Care, journalist Marilyn Marchione reports, ‘Forty years after the National Cancer Act launched the “war on cancer,” the battle is not just finding cures and better treatments but also being able to afford them.’ New and arguably more effective diagnostic and treatment equipment, drugs and surgical techniques are expensive, driving up the cost of insurance premiums and copays for those of us who have insurance in the first place. And unanticipated, lifelong expenses impact everyone. As Marchione further states, ‘The financial strain is showing: Some programs that help people pay their bills have seen a rise in requests, and medical bills are a leading cause of bankruptcies.’ Meanwhile, getting help with the financial strain of having cancer is far from easy. When you have been diagnosed with cancer, it can be a daily challenge not to panic, let alone try to find and sort through getting help. The American Society of Clinicial Oncology provides a downloadable planning resource at this link: Managing the Cost of Cancer Care. Their list of info and links to organizations that provide financial assistance is here: Financial Resources for Cancer Care. But the reality of simply making use of these resources can be a burden in itself, at a time when you are feeling least able to take care of business. While vulnerable individuals struggle with all this, the political debate continues to rage on about how to fix it, often freighted with far more rhetoric than constructive reasoning. Many people are probably unaware of how large a sector of our healthcare system is already operated and funded by nonprofit entities. The Alliance for Advancing Nonprofit Healthcare outlines the extent of this reality, and the justification for continuing it, in its report The Value of Nonprofit Healthcare. The Affordable Healthcare Act continues to elicit heated argument across the political spectrum, some specious, some legitimate, about its impact on our system. Later this month, the Supreme Court will begin to hear oral arguments on its constitutionality, the result of which could impact not only our future access to healthcare, but the current status of funding for Medicaid, the program that, among other things, administers the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, started by the Centers for Disease Control to provide “low-income, uninsured, and underserved women access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services.” How all this will play out is anyone’s guess. But I predict that a lot of us will be wearing tighter belts — if we can afford belts at all — in the future. How much has cancer cost you or someone you know?

233,26,68,28,2,2012,2012-02-28,"Published at: 10:02 am - February 28, 2012 There’s something oddly comforting about weather that reflects one’s emotions. While we’ve had a rather mild winter here, it’s still February, a month that is unpredictable at best, a month when the best days are still cold, with a wind off the ocean that bites through your clothes, no matter how well-prepared you think you are when you leave the house. The colors of the landscape are muted, the grass dormant, with only a vague hint here and there of the resurgent growth to come in the spring. There is often a chill fog over everything that mutes the colors even more, makes you strain your eyes looking for details, landmarks, the road you are on as you try to find your way home. The cold, the biting wind, the rain and snow, the fog, even the indifferent sun on clear days, all of February’s weather here makes you cautious, damped down, slow. At night, the weather’s treachery multiples, sometimes painfully so. It’s easy to get lost. It’s the perfect metaphor for grief. I feel like I am wrapped in a cold fog, even when I’m out of the weather. I put one foot in front of the other. I go to work. I come home, crawl into bed, pull an extra blanket over me. I find it hard to think, to organize my day, to remember what I’m supposed to do. Often, I cry. Always, underneath everything, I think of Rachel. Thoughts of her are never far from the surface. It’s painful to think of her, but I can’t stop myself. And I don’t want to. I want her to stay alive in my heart — laughing, determined, wise, generous. Helping me figure out how to go on without her. My ability to go on is minimal right now, but I know that slowly, my grief will transform itself, like spring transforms the landscape, into light and clarity. But it cannot be rushed. I cannot change my weather, but I can endure it. Text of my eulogy for Rachel, at her Memorial Service on 11 February, 2012.

Enormous thanks go to Ronnie at Being Sarah for obtaining and posting these links for the recordings of that live feed, in case you didn’t get to watch it in real time. And I echo his thanks to Courtney G. Woodhouse, who set up the feed and provided these links so quickly. Unfortunately, as Ronnie mentions, the links don’t include the first three speakers, who were Rachel’s sister-in-law Jessalynn, Rach’s mother-in-law (the incomparable MIL mentioned in several of her posts) and Rach’s dear, wonderful mom, who spoke for herself as well as for Rach’s brother, who could not be there. Sarah, of Being Sarah, recorded these three women on film herself and will be able to provide links to their contributions at a later date. * It was indescribable to be there. So, I will let these links, and those who are on them, speak for themselves.

235,26,7,13,1,2016,2016-01-13,"Published at: 03:01 pm - January 13, 2016 If you have any friends in the breast cancer cyber-community, it cannot have escaped your notice that we have lost too many of them lately. One of the latest is Holley Kitchen. She posted a simple but eloquent homemade video on YouTube on June 4, 2015. Like a lightning bolt, it shot some much-needed clarity into the public consciousness about the reality of metastatic breast cancer. As of August, 2015, when Holley spoke at a meeting of the American Cancer Society, she estimated that her video had been viewed by 50 million people. If you haven’t seen it or want to see it again, here it is. I don’t know about anyone else, but it still makes me weep. Yesterday, it was announced on Holley’s Facebook page that she had died. She was, sadly, only one of several folks I’ve known or known about who have died of metastatic breast cancer in recent months. 2015 was a tough year, and 2016 hasn’t started out any better. Every week, it seems, I will see a birthday notice on my Facebook timeline about a friend who has died of metastatic breast cancer. Just today, Marie wrote about this heart-stopping experience on her blog. When I tell you that I have lost count of how many times this has happened to me, it is not because I’m a thoughtless, forgetful git. It’s because too many people I know have died of or are living with metastatic cancer. “Don’t mind if I fall apart. There’s more room in a broken heart.” ~ Carly Simon In May of 2015, US Vice President Joe Biden lost his son to brain cancer. Last night, during his State of the Union address, President Obama announced a plan to intensify research into cancer. Calling it a ‘moonshot,’ he said that VP Biden would head up this initiative. Recognizing that cancer is not one disease, but many, the Washington Post reports that this project will in fact be comprised of many initiatives, some already underway. Indeed, many cancer research advocates have already met with Joe Biden’s staff, including Dr. Wagle of the MBCProject. Biden himself has set up a page for the Cancer Moonshot, outlining his plan and inviting comments. While many in and around Congress have stated that cancer research is one subject about which there is true bipartisanship, forgive me if I’m feeling skeptical. In the past few years, Congressional wrangling about the budget has resulted in funding cuts that have affected the National Institutes of Health, curtailed opportunities for newly-minted post-doc candidates, even forcing some of them to consider a different career path, and forced the National Cancer Institute to change how it organizes clinical trials. And we’ve all heard ad nauseam about Congress cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood, which would have gone not to abortion services, but to other health services like cancer screenings. Meanwhile, several legislators, like Ted Cruz of Texas, who are science deniers, serve on and even head up important committees that have oversight for scientific research. Despite all that, or because of it, if you feel inclined to do some lobbying or letter-writing, good luck figuring out who to contact. I just visited the Congress.gov page that lists all the House and Senate committees, did a little searching about ‘health research’ and ‘cancer research,’ roamed around the Appropriations committees of both houses, as well as a few other likely suspects, and groaned. There are few straight paths through the labyrinth of committees and subcommittees to the people who actually decide who funds what. Back in October, 2015, Beth Caldwell zeroed in on the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, then working on legislation about cancer research. She met with staffers, and posted a call for action to contact legislators about improving research and statistical tracking for metastatic breast cancer. Image from 1902 film “A Trip to the Moon” I can’t say if any of this soothes my battered heart. Honestly, I’m still catching my breath after Carolyn’s recent death. Her birthday was this past when her family held a memorial gathering for her. I couldn’t be there, but I did send METAvivor a contribution in her memory. No matter what I do, I think I’ve shed some tears every day, for her and for others, during the past month. Sometimes, doing something, anything, can mitigate the helpless rage that often follows grief. Sometimes not. At the moment, the person at the center of potential legislative and funding action seems to be Joe Biden himself. Maybe tweeting him, commenting on his Moonshot Page, or at least keeping up with him on his official page won’t bring back Carolyn or Holley or anyone else, but I’d like to hope that eventually it will spare someone a little future heartache. In the meantime, I put one foot in front of the other, a little numb, a lot sad, and try to remember to tell my friends that I love them.

236,26,70,12,2,2012,2012-02-12,"Published at: 04:02 pm - February 12, 2012 Rachel Cheetham Moro 1970-2012 Yesterday, I was truly grateful and privileged to participate in Rachel’s memorial service, and to be surrounded by her friends and family. I was grateful that three other sisters in our blogosphere were able to be there with me — Sarah Horton, of Being Sarah; Gayle Sulik, author of Pink Ribbon Blues; and Stacey, of Bringing Up Goliath. I was grateful for the tears, love, stories, laughter and sheer gratitude expressed by so many for having her in our lives. I was grateful to be able to speak about her, too, in my turn. Her husband, her beloved Anthony, kindly shared this link to some photos of Rachel throughout her too-short but amazing life: Rachel’s life in pictures. Today, for now, my own words have run dry, but they will come again. All week, I’ve had poetry in my head, as so many of us have had and shared. And in particular, two of my favorite poems by Marge Piercy seem so aptly to describe the Rachel we all knew and valued and loved. I’d like to share them. * The first, To be of use: The people I love the best jump into work head first without dallying in the shallows and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight. They seem to become natives of that element, the black sleek heads of seals bouncing like half submerged balls. I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart, who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience, who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward, who do what has to be done, again and again. I want to be with people who submerge in the task, who go into the fields to harvest and work in a row and pass the bags along, who stand in the line and haul in their places, who are not parlor generals and field deserters but move in a common rhythm when the food must come in or the fire be put out. The work of the world is common as mud. Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust. But the thing worth doing well done has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident. Greek amphoras for wine or oil, Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums but you know they were made to be used. The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real. * The second, an excerpt from For Strong Women: […]A strong woman is a mass of scar tissue that aches when it rains and wounds that bleed when you bump them and memories that get up in the night and pace in boots to and fro. A strong woman is a woman who craves love like oxygen or she turns blue choking. A strong woman is a woman who loves strongly and weeps strongly and is strongly terrified and has strong needs. A strong woman is strong in words, in action, in connection, in feeling; she is not strong as a stone but as a wolf suckling her young. Strength is not in her, but she enacts it as the wind fills a sail. What comforts her is others loving her equally for the strength and for the weakness from which it issues, lightning from a cloud. Lightning stuns. In rain, the clouds disperse. Only water of connection remains, flowing through us. Strong is what we make each other. ________________________ Posted in: Making A Difference by Kathi 17 Comments blogging, friendship, Rachel Cheetham Moro",0,1,0.2613095238095239
240,26,74,31,1,2012,2012-01-31,"Published at: 04:01 pm - January 31, 2012 Shadows and fog The story I am going to tell in this post is true. It’s a story that has been told to me over the past several months. Certain details have been omitted, but I asked for and got permission to relate the essentials here. The essentials are accurate. The image of the straitjacket was borrowed from the website of a medical supplier that many of us in healthcare are familiar with — the Posey Company, which makes patient restraints, as well as other non-restraining mobility equipment. I Photoshopped it slightly. There are no actual straitjackets in this story, thank goodness, only metaphorical and societal ones. This is not a nice story. But it’s not an uncommon or even an unusual one. It has something of a happy ending, if ‘happy’ is even the right word. It represents a long, harrowing chapter in one woman’s life, and the ongoing story continues. But the end of this particular chapter would have been much better had the means not been so unconscionably wretched, inappropriate and avoidable. It is, in my opinion, a snapshot of a healthcare and social system that is sometimes dangerously crazy. It started with breast cancer. Bad luck and trouble This is the prologue. Every day, women have their breasts amputated to save them from breast cancer. Some of them are young, some of them not so young. Some of them, including the woman in this story, have seen their mothers or sisters or aunts die of breast cancer. Some of them opt for immediate reconstruction, some don’t. Some of them have never had any other significant healthcare problems before. Some of them have. Some of them, including the woman in this story, have a prior history of disability and chronic pain, have no significant other or anyone at home who can help them. Some of them, like the woman in this story, have a history of depression or anxiety or bipolar disorder or physical pain or life trauma that has left its mark on their psyches. All of them are fearful and in need of compassion and competent help before and after their surgery. This chapter started with a bilateral mastectomy and expander placement. It started without a thorough, comprehensive assessment of the patient’s health history. It started with a disingenuous and incomplete discussion of the potential post-op problems associated with this surgery. It started without addressing the patient’s psycho-social circumstances, without an honest apprehension of post-op pain or lack of mobility or lymphedema risk or possible infection or surgical complications. It started without genuine informed consent. It started, as so many of these stories do, with medical optimism, with the limited perspective of medical specialization, with a sincere, if misguided, intent to solve a medical problem and perhaps save a life from the ravages of cancer. Before the woman in this story had her surgery, her surgeon expressed surprise that she was concerned about pain and decreased mobility afterward. He was surprised to hear that women found it painful to raise their arms after having their breasts cut off. But he did reassure her that her post-op pain would be controlled. So, with trepidation and resolve, she had her bilateral mastectomy and expander placement. The surgery appeared to go well, but in the hospital, because she has a history of chronic pain, her post-op pain was not adequately addressed. It took complaints to hospital administration, phone calls by relatives to hospital personnel, just to get the hospital staff to give her appropriate and effective pain medication. She stayed with friends immediately after discharge. She probably didn’t stay long enough. When she got home, where she had noone to help her, she had acute pain from drains, and difficulty moving her arms in order to dress or bathe herself. Her drains had to stay in longer than usual. They hurt whenever she moved. They disrupted her sleep. She did have a competent and compassionate homecare nurse. Later, she had a homecare rehab therapist to help her move her arms again. Along the way, during the course of her recovery, she had to be rehospitalized, several times, for local infections, systemic infections, and other complications. Eventually, her expanders had to be removed. They were just too painful, caused too many problems. Throughout all of this, it is not clear that she ever received adequate information about post-op clothing or prostheses or outpatient emotional support. None of this did much for her emotional well-being. Meanwhile, she had no car, no job, and was living on the poverty-level income of federal disabilty, one of those so-called entitlements that politicians are fond of debating. The average annual income for those receiving federal disability is less than $14,000. The national average annual wage in the U.S. for 2010 was $41,673.83. The unbearable darkness of being Inevitably perhaps, after several months of pain, illness, side effects, surgical complications, and poor sleep, she hit the wall. She developed insomnia. Several days in a row went by when she could not sleep at all. She felt like she was losing her mind. She just wanted her misery to end. She just wanted some relief. So she called her counseling therapist, a woman who’d treated her effectively for several years. Her therapist agreed that she needed some immediate help. She herself wasn’t available, but she referred her to an emergency outpatient counseling clinic that the woman had received help from previously. She called a friend, who took her to the outpatient clinic. She was not seen by the clinic counselor who knew her. She was seen by a young woman who did not know her well. This counselor felt that perhaps a brief hospitalization might help her get her medications sorted out and help her get some sleep. She agreed. She talked to her regular counselor again by phone, who also agreed and said she would call ahead and get the ball rolling. Her friend drove her to the hospital and offered to stay with her, but she felt that since there was light at the end of the tunnel now, she would be all right on her own. She was left in a hallway in the chaotic Emergency Department. An unfriendly, unsympathetic male nurse threw a johnny at her and ordered her to change in one of the bathrooms. She was not taken to a cubicle. There were none available. Hours went by. She was not seen by a doctor. She was not assessed by anyone. Instead, the male nurse ordered her to sign herself in for a stay in the psychiatric ward. He told her she was not allowed to leave, even though she’d arrived there voluntarily. He told her she was considered a suicide risk. When she tried to ask questions, he hollered at her that she’d better cooperate or they would ‘deal’ with her accordingly. There was no hospital room available yet, so she would have to stay in the ER hallway until there was one. He told her that when they found her a room, she could not have her belongings, including her cell phone. In a nearby cubicle, a woman who had taken an illegal drug overdose was screaming and being restrained by several staff, including the male nurse. She began to be very frightened. She called a family member to ask that a lawyer be contacted. She called her counselor. She called the outpatient clinic that had sent her there. No one answered her questions. No one she called could come to keep her company. More hours went by. The male nurse returned and tossed a urine cup at her and said they had to draw blood. She was still in the hallway. She tried to explain that she had a hard time with needles and needed to lie down. He again threatened that she’d better cooperate. By now, she was terrified. Finally, another female nurse came back with the male nurse to draw the blood. She again explained to them as calmly as she could that she really needed to lie down, because she often fainted when her blood was drawn. Finally, a curtained partition was found and a gurney moved into the hallway so that she could lie on. No one would explain why they needed urine or blood samples. Several hours after she arrived, she was admitted to a room in the psych ward. Her belongings were taken away from her and stored. She was by now exhausted, traumatized, and felt a hundred times worse now than she did before she called her counselor earlier in the day. She was finally seen by a doctor, who was, at least, reasonable and reassuring. He reviewed her meds, made some recommendations and much-needed changes. She had been on one medication, prescribed for various diagnoses from seizures to migraines to bipolar disorder, that is known to interact adversely with several other meds and cause numerous side effects. He discontinued it and prescribed something much gentler and more effective. She was able to sleep at last. She was kept on this psych unit for six days. She received no individual counseling. She was not allowed to call anyone. There were no activities, no books, only one ‘group’ therapy session each day. There was nothing to do but watch television in a group recreation room, which was occupied by patients who displayed much more serious psychiatric symptoms. By comparison, despite her crazy-making ER experience, she realized she felt sane, but no thanks to the atmosphere or amenities. She was assured that she would be discharged soon. One of the unit nurses apologized for the lack of attention, explaining that they were chronically short-staffed, that this was not how they used to operate. With nothing else to do, she spent her time walking the halls, in a johnny and hospital slippers. Her feet began to hurt from walking on the concrete, linoleum-covered floors, but she kept walking. That, and the new medications she was on, at least allowed her to sleep every night. Finally, she was allowed to go home. Broke and betrayed After she got home, she met with her original counselor. She described her hospital experience. She assured her counselor that she would be filing a complaint against the hospital. She told her counselor that she would never have agreed to go at all had she known how badly she would be treated, especially in the emergency department. She had managed already to talk to a hospital staff member who admitted that the male nurse who had terrorized her had been reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the past. He would now be warned that he would lose his job if there were any further complaints. Her counselor was horrified, and admitted that she had no idea that she would be subjected to such treatment. She accepted her counselor’s apology, but also said that her ignorance was not a good excuse, that she should have known what would happen, that she should have been acquainted with the hospital’s apparent standard operating procedure, that she should have, at least, been able to warn her that she was going to be considered a suicide risk, that her rights were going to be taken away as soon as she set foot in the door. She told her that she could no longer trust her advice after this, that their therapeutic relationship was damaged irreparably. How is it that arguably the most sophisticated healthcare system in the world allowed this to happen? How could it not simply help this woman get to sleep? How is it that it could not prevent this woman from falling down the rabbit hole? And when she did, how is it that, instead of adjusting her medications in a friendly, calm doctor’s office, they sent her to hell on earth? I don’t know the answers to these questions. But I do know that the insanity of this experience was not hers. When I was doing research for this post, I came upon this eloquent essay by author John Shirley about the hideous inadequacies of healthcare for the mentally ill, called The Mental State of the Union. In the essay, Shirley asks, “What if, as a society, we’re far crazier than we realize?” Indeed. ‘Happy’ ending Remarkably, the woman in this story is still sleeping through the night so far. That’s the good news, the ‘happy’ ending. And her path reports showed ‘no evidence of disease.’ Her medications are working better. She still has pain and scars from her mastectomy, but she has no plans to attempt reconstruction. She is trying to scrape together the money to buy a car, so that maybe she can find a part-time job. She also has to find another place to live. She is still poor. It started with breast cancer.

Surely some revelation is at hand… From The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well, I’d like to think some revelation was at hand. But when I’m in limbo, it’s hard to tell when the end of it might be revealed. It’s also hard to describe limbo. By its very nature, it defies description, flouts my attempts to pin it down. After all, if I could describe it, I might not, in fact, be in it anymore. I can tell when I’m in it, though. I don’t feel quite like myself, as though my edges were blurry. I don’t look blurry to anyone else. Outwardly, I function. I do remember to turn off the coffee pot before I leave the house, put some crunchies in the cat dish, grab my keys. I remember to show up for work, put on the parking brake before I get out of the car. The underpinnings of daily life keep me from falling off the edge of this formlessness. It reminds me a little of the immediate shock-and-awe phase I went through right after I was diagnosed, but without the adrenalin rush. A rush would be nice, actually. It would be more interesting than feeling like a cardboard cut-out of my usual self. I guess the good news is that, if Yeats was right, then at least I range among ‘the best.’ I certainly seem to ‘lack all conviction.’ It would be nice, though, to have a little ‘passionate intensity.’ I almost wouldn’t mind having a flat-out temper tantrum, but I can’t seem to work myself up enough for one. Sigh. This is not a new thing. When I look back, I seem to hit a limbo skid about this time every year since I finished acute treatment late in 2008. My post-cancer-treatment, mid-winter slouch. A year ago, I turned to song lyrics by Shawn Colvin to describe it: China gets broken And it will never be the same Boats on the ocean Find their way back again I am weaving Like a drunkard Like a balloon up in the air I’m needing a puncture and someone To point me somewhere From “Steady On” by Shawn Colvin & J. Leventhal ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I feel perhaps a little less broken this year, more glued together. I just don’t feel like the pieces are in the right place yet. Two years ago, in January of 2010, I was wrestling with acute grief over my lost self, but trying to plow through it and look ahead. My chosen song was from Cyndi Lauper, my lyric, “I wanna be the one to walk in the sun/oh, girls just wanna have fun.” The grief is not acute now, but it’s still there, like white noise. I can hear it when it’s too quiet. The year before that, in 2009, I’d just finished acute treatment and started this blog. I’d only just “stopped freaking out on a more or less continual basis.” There was no music in my head, no poetry in my soul that January. Just a deep weariness. So, I have felt better each year. I’m just not quite — all there yet. I don’t even know if there is an ‘all there’ there. Meanwhile, at least my cardboard cut-out self is still standing, still putting on a good front. So far, no one else seems to notice that she’s not too steady on her pins. I just need to keep her out of the wind for a while. Here we go again. There’s a little black spot on the sun today, That’s my soul up there. It’s the same old thing as yesterday That’s my soul up there.[…] There’s a blue whale beached by a springtime’s ebb That’s my soul up there There’s a butterfly trapped in a spider’s web That’s my soul up there I have stood here before inside the pouring rain, With the world turning circles running ’round my brain From “The King of Pain” by The Police ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Because I’ve lived long enough, I know that having an identity crisis is not the end of the world, although it’s quite unpleasant while it’s happening. Because I’ve been an artist long enough, I also know that fallow periods are necessary, that they do not signify emptiness. There is work going on, it’s just hidden from view. At the end of it, my cells and neurons having rearranged themselves, I will emerge, feeling less tentative, more solid, more able to meet life’s challenges, more willing to crawl out on a limb, risk myself in creativity, find myself in perspective, lose myself in laughter and friendship. But for now, all I can do is trust — trust that the world will keep spinning on its axis, trust my faith in life, trust myself. I don’t much like it, but there are worse things than feeling rudderless. At least I’m floating and drifting, not sinking to the bottom. That’s good. Happy Limboversary to me. And there’s always chocolate. Posted in: Art & Music, Attitude, Life & Mortality, Survivorship by Kathi 16 Comments limbo",0,1,0.07284137051578914
242,26,76,18,1,2012,2012-01-18,"Published at: 02:01 pm - January 18, 2012 Gimme Some Indestructible Gauntlets. First of all, a word of profound thanks to all my cyber-peeps on Facebook and elsewhere for your understanding and concern yesterday. If love and good will can prevent cancer, then after yesterday, I’m set for life. As I sniffled my way through a few meltdowns, all your comments, messages and emails touched my heart and filled me with gratitude. And knowing that most of you have lived through this nonsense yourselves means a great deal. No one knows how it feels to hear the news of a cancer diagnosis like another person who’s heard it herself. Many of you have already read of my recent adventures in colonoscopy. To recap briefly, I had scheduled my first, recommended over-fifty colonoscopy in 2008. Then I was diagnosed with breast cancer, so I postponed it. Just over two years later, in January of 2011, I finally rescheduled it. And despite following the prep instructions faithfully, the prep didn’t work completely, so the colonoscopy was not completed. I scheduled another for a year after that, which took place a week and a half ago, on January 6th. So, I rang in the New Year by avoiding fiber and red food for a week, drinking a few gallons of Gatorade and Miralax for a few days, and off I went. The colonoscopy was completed this time, several polyps were removed, and the doctor said they all looked normal. But I woke up during the procedure, to find myself with severe abdominal cramping, somehow managed to mumble that I was awake and in pain, and got no help for it. Afterwards, I stumbled home, once again disillusioned with the inattentiveness of healthcare clinicians, feeling like I’d been kicked by a horse. I spent the next several days recovering and researching clinical protocols for managing procedural pain. Last week, I called to find out if the path results were back on all the polyps that were removed. I got a call back from a very nice nurse case manager. Yes, the report was back, but she was out of the office, so she didn’t have it in front of her. But she assured me that I would have been called by then if there was anything suspicious. I explained that I’d already been through the cancer adventure, and that, as such, I hated waiting for path results. She said very kindly that she would check the report and call me back if there was bad news. And she didn’t call. I did have an appointment with the nurse practitioner at the gastroenterologist’s office anyway. So, feeling confident that there would be nothing more onerous at this visit than my feedback about the inadequate prep instructions beforehand and the inadequate pain relief during, I visited her yesterday. Bad News, Good News And she told me that one of the seven polyps removed turned out to have a top-dressing of carcinoma in-situ, and was characterized overall as something called ‘tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.’ If you were to Google this, which of course I have, you would find that this is the non-invasive version of colon cancer. That was the bad news. The good news was that the entire polyp, with its treacherous cancer cap, was removed, along with the stem, and that they got it all. Which makes it sound like a cancer mushroom. [There’s a fungus among us, as my father used to say.] And that no other treatment is needed at this time. Naturally, this means that I do not get to wait another ten years before my next colonoscopy. My next one will be scheduled one year from now. So. Major gobsmack. It was an interesting sensation to experience a condensed version, as it were, of my previous cancer experience. Sort of like bad speed dating, or the Readers Digest Version of cancer. I felt all the shock & awe, panic, astonishment, relief, miserable awareness of implications, and grim acceptance of the need for lifelong vigilance, all in the space of several seconds. As one of my breast cancer pals succinctly put it, “YIKES!! And WHEW!” Quite a field day for my neurons and adrenal cortex, I must say. It’s amazing I could even speak at all after that. But I did. And we talked about my maternal family’s cancer history. I brought it up. One of the things that drove me to persevere on this colonoscopy adventure, despite the almost fiendishly distracting circumstances of the last few years, was that my cousin died of colon cancer when she was in her fifties. There is some sort of suspected genetic relationship among breast cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer, all of which have appeared on my mother’s side of the family, along with melanoma, which killed my cousin’s dad. Thus, the NP and I visited the subject of genetic testing. It was a revisit for me. I saw a genetic counselor a year or so ago to investigate this, and since my rellies with the relevant cancers were all ‘secondary,’ i.e., first cousins and aunts, genetic testing was only a borderline recommendation. But I don’t have any ‘primary’ relatives who had cancer, no siblings, and my parents died of other things. So, it’s not clear that genetic testing would be beneficial. But the NP is going to look into it and get back to me. I did somehow manage to articulate my feedback and suggestions. The next several minutes were almost more unpleasant than the preceding ones. But the long and short of it was that the NP, who is a very smart and compassionate woman by the way, could really offer no satisfactory explanation for why the doctor did not recommend that I be given more medication when I woke up. She did, however, assure me that in the future, there would be a separate anaesthesiologist in attendance who would mostly likely use a different moderate sedation cocktail and make sure my recent experience was not repeated. “Kathi,” she said at the end, “I’m really glad you had this colonoscopy.” “Me, too,” I admitted. What else could I possibly say? I’ll drink two gallons of Gatorade and Miralax every week if it keeps me from developing invasive colon cancer. And, as I said to one of my BFFs last night, I seem to have experienced every other miserable thing that could occur with a colonoscopy, so why not this, too? You know, just to round things out. The Zero that isn’t. So, I’ve had two types of cancer. And thus far survived. Yay me. It’s hard to describe what I feel. I’ve had a few random thoughts about researching what other sorts of cancer can appear in non-invasive form, but I don’t have the heart for it right now. So far, I’ve had two kinds of high-grade, in-situ cancers that, if left unattended, would have had a good chance of worsening. To all those people out there in oncology-land who have been contemplating the idea of removing ‘carcinoma’ from the names of some of these in-situ tumors: don’t even go there. Because guess what? We’re not off the hook. Because any prudent discussion with your patients has to include the C word anyway. So, who do you think you’re kidding? I wonder if there should be some sort of Stage Zero Cancer Club. Because I think I deserve honorary life-time membership now. And I think we should all get Wonder Woman’s Lasso of Truth to use during all our follow-up medical appointments. And we should probably consider a name change. “Stage Zero” just doesn’t quite cut it. Maybe “YIKES! WHEW!” would be more apt. And I’d also like a pair of Wonder Woman’s Indestructible Bullet-Bashing Gauntlets while I’m at it. Because I’m not feeling very indestructible right now. The “Wonder Woman” movie poster above was, of course, Photoshopped by moi. Please feel free to share your own “YIKES! WHEW!” experiences.

244,26,78,7,1,2012,2012-01-07,"Published at: 07:01 pm - January 07, 2012 First, do no harm? This is not what I wanted to write about today. But yesterday, I woke up during an outpatient diagnostic procedure, began to feel stabbing abdominal pain, made the surgeon and clinical staff aware of this, and nothing was done about it. I was in a haze induced by the conscious-sedation cocktail I’d been given — Versed, Fentanyl, and, interestingly, Benadryl — so perhaps I was unable to articulate my symptoms as clearly as I might have. But still, I think saying, “That hurts!” and grimacing should have provided enough clues. I was receiving a colonoscopy at the time. As far as I was able to determine, it appeared that the general exploratory part of the scope had been completed. I woke up while the gastroenterologist was removing one of several polyps that he found in my descending colon, the portion that runs down the left side of the abdomino-pelvic cavity. As a clinician, I found it interesting to see the scope screen in front of me, and to see how the polyps were caught by means of a surgical lasso (snare) and ‘burned’ off (cauterized) in essentially one step. But as a patient, I felt an abrupt stab of localized pain during every other excision. It is commonly asserted that polyp removal is not painful because the colon lining does not have pain receptors. But part of the procedure involves pumping carbon dioxide gas into the colon to allow for a clearer view, and this gas can cause abdominal bloating, cramping, and pain. Well, in my case, it certainly did. A lot. I felt like I’d been kicked by a horse. Several times. And it took several hours to go away. Following on the heels of a week-long non-fiber diet, two days of drinking a few gallons of laxative prep, over thirty hours of consuming only clear liquids, plus interrupted sleep and no liquids the night before, let’s just say that I was pretty ragged by the time I left the hospital yesterday. I’d been looking forward to eating a normal meal after all this, but I had no appetite, couldn’t stand up straight because of abdominal pain, and ended up spending most of the day in bed, with a large heating pad over my belly. I survived, yes. And I feel better today, less haggard thank goodness, but still not quite normal. My reason for writing this is that I do think, in the 21st century, it is unnecessary and utterly pointless for patients to endure so much pain during outpatient procedures. As far as endoscopy and colonoscopy goes, it is still common in most countries not to provide any sort of sedation or pain relief during the procedure. In the U.S., it’s the standard of care to do so, and yet, I’ve heard countless stories from American friends about inadequate sedation and pain management during GI procedures, as well as during many of the other outpatient diagnostic and excisional procedures we have to endure as cancer patients. And I ask myself why this is. Pain is harm. Here’s a typical story, one I’ve personally heard far too often. A woman feels a lump in her breast, goes to her primary care doctor, gets sent for mammogram, which is positive, and gets referred to a breast cancer doctor. So, already beset with anxiety by now, she goes to the breast cancer doctor, who does a physical exam and an ultrasound that confirms the presence of the lump. The breast cancer doctor then says she needs to take a biopsy, hauls out a ‘fine-needle’ biopsy gizmo, a misnomer for what in truth looks like a large syringe that one might use to tranquilize a horse, and without further ado or topical anaesthetic, jabs it into her patient. Or, also not uncommon, she administers a local anaesthetic, and jabs the biopsy needle in without waiting for the anaesthetic to anaesthetize. And guess what? It hurts like hell. Big surprise, huh? Nothing like heaping trauma upon trauma. And this is only the beginning, the intro to what is a frightening experience that may soon become a disillusioning one as well, as we experience endless procedural poking, prodding, jabbing, burning and poisoning, all too often administered with a baffling lack of compassion and plain old common sense. And it’s baffling for one fundamental reason: causing needless pain and anxiety is just not good medicine. I found an excellent article outlining clinical practice recommendations for procedural pain management, published in the July, 2011 issue of Pain Management Nursing, and posted on Medscape, that was put together by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN). In it, the authors assert that any and all of us ‘who undergo potentially painful procedures have a right to optimal pain management before, during, and after the procedure and should have a plan in place […] before initiation of any procedure.’ [If the Medscape link doesn’t work, you may find a PDF at this link. If you’d like a PDF of the references, please leave a request in a comment below.] You would think it should be common knowledge in healthcare by now, but apparently it’s not universally understood that pain is, in fact, harmful. The ASPMN paper states: Pain can cause both immediate and long-term harmful effects that do not discriminate based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. There are limited data regarding […] the effects of procedural pain; however, it stands to reason that the effects of acute pain would apply to procedural pain. These effects consist of a variety of physical, emotional, behavioral, cognitive and psychologic manifestations, including fear, anxiety, anger, […] refusal to consent to further procedures, and distrust of the health care team, and may effect overall economic, social, and spiritual well-being. Well, duh. Pain is stressful. It robs our bodies of the energy we need to heal, and when it is not adequately addressed, it robs us of trust and confidence in our healthcare providers. Several studies have demonstrated that post-surgical pain can tax our immune systems and throw our neurotransmitters out of whack, which can lead to increased infections, poor wound healing, and depression. For people with cancer in particular, as painful procedures pile up, it is crucial to effective treatment outcomes to prevent, mitigate and relieve as much procedural, treatment or surgical pain as possible. So, why aren’t universal standards for procedural pain management practiced throughout the healthcare community? It certainly is not because these standards aren’t known or readily available to clinicians. Standards for the use of conscious sedation, topical anaesthetics, and local anaesthesia for outpatient medical procedures and surgeries are well-documented. Another excellent publication, Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses, a book published by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, devotes an entire chapter to pain management. In it, the authors assert that Lack of adequate assessment and inappropriate treatment remain the major factors of undertreatment of pain. There is ample evidence that the appropriate use of analgesics — the right drug(s) at the right intervals — can provide good pain relief for the majority of patients. Thus, institutions should place their money and effort on improving these provider behaviors (assessment, prescription and administration of analgesics). Okay, the nurses seem to get it. What about the doctors? With due apologies to my physician friends out there, who include a number of surgeons, I’ve had frequent cause to suspect over the years that a lot of people who grow up to become surgeons were the sort of children who pulled the wings off flies. Yet, survey studies have found that physician perceptions of procedural pain do in fact match up with patient perceptions of the same procedures. But the problem seems to be whether physicians perceive the pain that their patients are actually feeling when they’re feeling it. One study published in Academic Medicine found significant discrepancies between physician perceptions of their patients’ suffering and their patients’ own descriptions of suffering, concluding that physicians needed better training in their evaluation and communication skills. But another study, published in Psychooncology, found that even with special training, physicians were no better than their untrained counterparts in communicating with and helping their cancer patients through their ordeal. Where does that leave us? Once again, it seems that the onus is often quite literally “on-us,” the patients, to ask for what we need. CancerCare.org recommends, as many others have, that we learn to be prepared consumers of healthcare. Particularly with cancer treatment, it helps to bring someone with us to our appointments, prepare a list of questions, take notes and/or record the visit, and keep asking questions if we are not sure we understand something. Often, nurse navigators or nurse practitioners can spend more time with us and address our concerns more thoroughly. In a previous post, Delayed Gratification, I listed some resources for patient self-advocacy. They are repeated at the end of this post. The above-mentioned Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality also provides some videos that may help you improve communication with your doctors. Before yesterday’s adventure, I had spent what I thought was ample time getting my questions answered by the nurse practitioner at the GI practice that was in charge of my colonoscopy. But it’s difficult to anticipate everything before every procedure. After the pathology results come back, I have a follow-up appointment with her. And once again, as I’ve had to do before, I’ll be providing some feedback about my experience yesterday, in the hope that it will improve a future experience for myself or someone else. However, I do hope that, as long as my polyps biopsies are negative, I won’t have to do this again for ten years! Live and learn… In the meantime, please feel free to share your stories here. It always helps to know you’re not alone.

245,26,79,31,12,2011,2011-12-31,"Published at: 04:12 pm - December 31, 2011 Still looking over my shoulder. While this amazon may be accidental, it was no accident that I started this blog on New Year’s Day. The great thing about New Year’s is the symbolic relief of leaving the past behind. On January 1st, 2009, I was hoping to leave breast cancer behind. Silly me. I was only just beginning to perceive the grip that cancer and its treatment would continue to have on me. But I learned. And writing this blog — and getting feedback from all of you — helped me navigate the shoals, feel grateful for your validation, and discover this snark thing that I could press into service to lighten the load. It’s been three years now, and I still haven’t been able to leave breast cancer behind. Because somewhere along the way, I realized there was too much to say and do so that we could all someday leave it behind, and we’re not there yet. I also learned, for about the zillionth time, that although we can only live in the present, the past profoundly contributes to who we are today. And life is what happens when we’re making other plans. Goodbye, 2011! Bye-bye, 2011. Some truly lovely and utterly unsnarky things occurred this past year. The best among them was making new friends in the blogosphere, and meeting several cyber-friends in real life. But some friends died of cancer, or lost loved ones to cancer, or were newly diagnosed, or found out they had mets, or found out their mets had spread, or endured other losses and challenges. So, as far as I’m concerned, it’s fine with me if 2011 goes right down the crapper. I could try to put a good snarky spin on it all, but I’m feeling a little stymied. Suffice it to say that the long list of miseries and heartaches visited upon my friends in 2011 seems to have been of rather biblical proportions. The only pestilence I haven’t been able to confirm specifically is a plague of locusts. Which brings me to the colonoscopy I have scheduled for the end (no pun intended) of this coming week. What was I thinking?? I really need to learn to plan better. Starting the year with a clean, er, slate. I suppose I would have to admit that I’d rather experience a colonoscopy than a plague of locusts, but it’s a near thing. So, why am I getting one? In addition to receiving a flurry of invitations to join the AARP, turning fifty in the U.S. also means you are encouraged to get a colonoscopy. While I am tempted to join any club that includes people like Betty White, I’ve been steadfastly tossing the AARP envelopes in the dustbin for several years now. I have my reasons, denial being first and foremost. However, the year I was to turn fifty, I did try to talk myself into adding yet another cancer screening procedure to my annual physical. But not right away. On the actual day of my fiftieth, I was suffering possibly the worst physical pain I’ve ever endured. A few months previously, I’d herniated a disk in my lumbar spine. I was not able, at the time, to exactly pinpoint the occasion during which this catastrophe occurred. But I believe it arose from the torrid romance I was then having with, remarkably enough, an electrical engineer who lived in a neighboring state. I know. Go figure. One wouldn’t ordinarily expect to find ‘torrid’ in the same sentence with ‘electrical engineer,’ but life is full of surprises. I’ll never know whether I busted my disk during one of our more energetic interludes, or during one or more of the several long, wintry, interstate drives involved in arranging our interludes. The onset of symptoms was gradual. But I do recall a particular moment at work, when I was, ironically enough, demonstrating a back stretch to a patient in the rehab gym, and I felt an extra little ping that I suspected I would pay for later. And I did. And crossed the pain Rubicon. And got myself an MRI, which told the ugly tale. I did indeed have a herniated disk. I’d had them before, and recovered nicely without too much fuss. But this one chose to squirt itself into the middle of my spinal canal, rather than sideways and outside of my backbone, where most self-respecting disk herniations go, and where there would have been a better than even chance that my body would, with a little anti-inflammatory assistance, have healed on its own. However, such was not to be. Instead, the squirt camped out on my L4 nerve root, sending a truly Machiavellian assortment of pain, scrambled nerve sensations, and rapidly deteriorating muscle strength down my entire left leg. Sitting was a nightmare. And lying down (as in sleeping) was diabolically painful. My best position was standing, which was okay as far as it went, but I didn’t happen to have a handy standing sling that I could sleep in at night. It was perhaps the only time in my life that I wished I were a bat, and could fold up my wings, hang by my feet from a tree, and sleep upside down. A little batty. In any event, on my 50th birthday, I was unable to slug much champagne, owing to the dilaudid I had to take to keep from fainting in agony. I had diskectomy surgery scheduled for ten days hence. Two of my oldest friends came to see me and soothe my fevered brow. I was able to eat cake, and I did time my next dilaudid dose so I could at least sip a little Veuve Clicquot. But it was not an exuberant celebration. The surgery, on the other hand, was completely successful — miraculous in fact — although I was really too close to menopause to realistically offer, with profound gratitude, to bear my neurosurgeon’s child. It took several months before I could sit or drive comfortably for any length of time, which curtailed interstate travel. But the good thing about it was that it got me out of jury duty that year. Needless to say, I postponed any and all thoughts of scheduling my baptismal colonoscopy. A few years later, when I could finally run up and down stairs, and hop around on my left leg (you’d be surprised at the things we physical therapists have to be able to demonstrate to our patients), I decided to bite the proverbial bullet and schedule the damn thing. So I scheduled it for a few weeks after my annual screening mammogram. Which turned out to be positive. Which is another whole story. Which eventually prompted me to launch this blog three years ago. Also needless to say, the charming adventure documented herein involved enough poking, prodding, slashing, burning, poisoning and squishing to last a lifetime, so I was in no state after all that to add a colonoscopy to this list of medical indignities. However, the reasons for getting one hovered somewhat ominously in the background. In the first place, my cousin had died of colon cancer in her early fifties a few years previously. And one of my aunts had had (and survived) ovarian cancer. And there was another female relative, also on that side of the family, who’d had breast cancer. I talked to a genetic counselor somewhere in all this about the suspected genetic relationship among breast, ovarian and colon cancer. So, finally, I scheduled my first official colorectal cancer screening one year ago. And it could not be successfully completed, because, I am loathe to admit, I failed my prep. Oh, well. One cannot succeed at every endeavor. Had my colonoscopy been scheduled later in the day, and had the prep directions been more specific, it would have been completed, and I wouldn’t be writing this. However, let’s just say that, at 6:30 a.m. on that fateful Friday morning, I was still too full of shit. Wasn’t the first time I’d been thus informed. The long and winding road. Earlier this year, I read with great hopefulness a few articles about a DNA blood test for colorectal cancer — you know, something you can do in the privacy of your own loo, with a little kit, and without the noisome prep required to clear out the several miles of your intestinal highway before a colonoscopy. But (or should I say ‘butt’), this home test is not the ‘gold standard’ in screening, and is not currently approved in the U.S. as a replacement for what is delicately described as “direct-visualization […] screening modalities.” So, here we are, a year later, and now, instead of participating in some glamorous New Year’s festivities, I am in the midst of whatever the opposite of girding my loins would be, in order to have another cancer test this coming Friday. Colon cancer is no laughing matter, but I do think it behooves one to find a way to laugh at the ‘direct-visualization screening modality’ involved. A friend suggested I read humorist Dave Barry’s description of the roto-rooter prep I am forced to engage in this week. I did, and I laughed, which is helpful. But I still have to do it. Apart from having a heavenly Versed-induced nap a year ago, I was quite miffed about my prep failure. I’m very good at following directions, and I can state categorically that I followed the prep instructions to the letter. And the prep did work — just not in time for my crack-of-dawn appointment. So, I had a little chat with the nice nurse practitioner at the gastroenterologists’ office, and she added an extra step. But otherwise I received the same clear-as-mud instruction sheet as last year. So, I decided to do a little research to, shall we say, clarify things more thoroughly. Where the instructions fail most egregiously, I’ve since learned, is in the section about what to eat in the week prior to the colonoscopy. My little blue sheet (with the GI logo at the top — a tasteful artistic rendering of a stomach with a suggestion of the plumbing leading therefrom) states that “high fiber products and seeds should be withheld 7 days before the procedure. No corn, popcorn, nuts, seeds or breads with seeds or nuts, vegetables with seeds such as tomatoes or cucumbers, etc.” It’s that final ‘etcetera’ that’s the sticking point, as it were. According to the Colon Cancer Resource, it turns out that, in reality, ALL vegetables and fruits and most of the juices, sauces, soups and various condiments made with them, must be considered ‘high fiber,’ and must be avoided in the 4 to 7 days before a colonoscopy. Red comestibles must also be avoided, which includes red meat, red jello, red drinks of any sort, and anything with red food coloring in it. That leaves white food and drink, which excludes whole grain breads, rice and pasta. Cheese is okay, but butter isn’t. Milk and milk products, which are arguably white, should be avoided. Clear, unpulpy broths and liquids are okay right up until the night before, which happily includes white wine, vodka and gin, but most sites advise avoiding alcohol at least 24 hours in advance, which is unhappily the time during which one might most wish to wash down that enormous container of Miralax (aka PEG, or propylene glycol) with a little liquor. Starving for the cure. If you have ever been concerned that you may not be consuming enough fruits and vegetables in your daily diet, try adhering to the above instructions for a few days. There may not be much sacrifice in avoiding lima beans, say, but you might find yourself positively bereft about giving up salsa, marinara sauce, and French onion soup. Indeed, it’s been difficult these past few days for me not to feel utterly persecuted for loving almonds, caesar salads sprinkled with sunflower seeds, or the occasional peanut-butter sandwich on whole wheat sourdough bread. I yearn for my blueberry yogurt. I pine for my pomegranate juice. I crave my clementines and I miss my oatmeal. My bioflavonoids and antioxidants have abandoned me! I just want to eat like a normal, reasonably health-conscious person who’s had cancer! Is that so wrong?? Heaven help me. And I haven’t even gotten to the Gatorade-cum-Miralax stage. Oh, gawd, I’m having flashbacks from last year. I never much liked Gatorade before last year. Since then, I positively loathe it. All right. I need to get a grip. What the hell can I eat and drink this week? Eggs. Cheese. White pasta. White bread and white crackers. Jello, as long as it’s not red. Potatoes, without the skin. Potato chips, as long as they’re not the fat-free kind cooked in Olestra. Fish, as long as it’s not too dark like swordfish. Chicken, without the skin. Chicken broth. Maybe a lean pork chop. White grape juice, strained lemonade and apple juice. Clear tea or coffee, without milk or cream. Non-red popsicles and Italian ice. And perhaps a nice pinot grigio to wash it all down, at least until Thursday. And there is that delightful Versed nap to look forward to. And, of course, there’s also that extra special je-ne-sais-quoi we folks-who’ve-had-cancer possess, that lovely test anxiety, that loss of innocence about ‘mere’ screening exams which we know all too well might in fact yield positive results. Oh, joy. Happy freakin’ New Year to me. In the meantime, no one said I couldn’t eat chocolate. At least for a few more days. Someone, anyone, please tell me you are doing something a lot more fun to ring in the New Year!

247,26,80,19,12,2011,2011-12-19,"Published at: 11:12 pm - December 19, 2011 Once again, I’ve been pondering a holiday post, but I didn’t really want to refer to that overriding Subject I usually write about. So, I just started thinking about all the people and things and activities that have helped me get through the past three years. And without a doubt, two of the most reliable, undemanding, consistently entertaining sources of love, friendship and fun in my life are my cats. Ironically enough, they each came to me from friends who had health concerns that were worse than mine, that made it impossible to keep them anymore. Each of them asked me specifically if I would give her cat a new home. Fiona, a female muted tortoiseshell, came first. Teddy, a gray and white Manx, which means he was born without a tail, came a little later. They’re about the same age in cat years, and from the beginning, developed a love/hate relationship with each other. Sometimes they hiss and yowl at one another, sometimes they play tag or nap together. Typical siblings. Otherwise, they really don’t ask for much. Well, maybe tuna once in a while. They don’t care if I’m tired or cranky or haven’t brushed my teeth or changed my socks. Indeed, they like smelly socks. They like anything and everything I touch, in fact, and when I come home from work, I often find them curled up with something I’ve worn – mittens, pajamas, whatever — sort of the way you might hug your sweetie’s teeshirt the morning after a long, romantic night. They’re unfailingly happy to see me whenever I’ve been gone for any length of time, be it five days or five minutes. They love to cuddle. They like to talk to me, and they’re good listeners. They’re affectionate and they have lovely soft coats and they purr. What more can a person ask for in a roommate? They’re also irrefutably and unapologetically themselves at all times. And they’re not afraid to be silly. And they love naps. I like to think we have a lot in common. Napsters There is virtually no place, no time, and no position that is not good for a nap. Cat and Mouse There is nothing you can do with a computer that is not improved — or even surpassed — by the presence of a cat or two. Turf Whatever you’re doing, occasionally it’s important to stake out your own territory. Teddy Position is everything. Fiona No matter what you’re doing, it’s important to look adorable. Literacy There’s nothing like a good book. Love Don’t forget to show your human that you love her. Teddy, Fiona and I hope you all have a peaceful, joyous holiday.

I think it is because I grew up with miniature schnauzers, and my mom, who lives nearby, still has two of these little gray canines. Leo and Benny have quirks—one incessantly barks at all people, even family members, who enter the house, and the other is obsessed with the roving pool cleaner and any squirrel he spots running outdoors; he also runs away from the leash when it is time for a walk, a little game he plays that drives my mom nutty. Despite their drawbacks, pups are all I have known; therefore, I have always voted for them. Never cats. Until 12 days ago. I do not know exactly how it happened, how I agreed to taking home from the Alachua County Humane Society three foster kittens—Owen (OMG, he is so small and cuddly and orange); Olive (she is the spunky, spirited one marked with black and white); and Ofelia (she is the shy, reserved one with a black and brown coat and beige paws). I had no idea how to care for kittens, but my boys, who have long begged for a pet, were so happy that I agreed to foster three sweet babies after learning about fostering opportunities at our Humane Society orientation that it seemed OK that I was clueless. The day after orientation, we headed home with three furry 6-week-old bundles in a travel crate with a litter box, litter, and dry and wet food. And now, I know how to care for kittens. I also now how to love kittens. When my boys ask me, “Do you like puppies or kittens better?” I do not have an easy answer. The vote is close. Because one of us has allergies to adult cats (not to kittens, just cats), we say that we will become a foster family; we will continue taking in kittens who need a place to stay and love in their hearts, and we will return them when they are ready for a forever home. Today, I returned Owen, Olive, and Ofelia to the Humane Society. Twelve days, they lived with us. We fed them, hugged them, played with them, comforted them, introduced them to our friends, and now, we love them. We think they love us, too. I am heartbroken. I am sad that our houseguests will live in a cage until they are adopted. I am crushed that they will likely be adopted one by one until only one of them remains. I fear that they will miss us like we will miss them. I worry that I will not be able to foster again and again, as planned, because it is too emotionally hard.

There was no middle between mammogram and diagnosis, though, and for me, an ultrasound, a needle biopsy, and a whole lot of waiting followed the initial screening. I know, we’re talking TV here, and stories must develop rapidly; plus, who knows, maybe this is how it happens for some women. I won’t be too picky about the beginnings of this storyline.

259,29,108,27,6,2016,2016-06-27,"Leslie won the LympheDIVAs giveaway sleeve. Here, she shows off her new fashion (and function) statement and shares her breast cancer story. I have been so fortunate and blessed in my cancer journey. My doctor received the “normal findings” of my annual mammogram, which was done in mid-May, with the notation that my tissue was dense. He called and said he would like for me to have an ultrasound done as an additional precaution. Early in June, I had the ultrasound and a small spot (4mm) showed up in my left breast. The radiologist recommended that although it was probably just a cyst, I should go ahead and have a core biopsy. This was done a week later, and 10 days postbiopsy, my doctor called to sadly inform me that I had stage 1 cancer. I was catching a plane to celebrate my father-in-law’s 95th birthday within a couple of hours after that call, so my husband and I decided that we would keep the news to ourselves for the long weekend while my doctor set up an appointment with one of our local surgeons for the following week. I must admit that I have felt from the beginning a sense of peace about this whole experience. I have never doubted that my Lord has been with me at all times, and I rest in His saving grace. When I returned from our trip, I met with the local surgeon and told him that because my mom was a survivor of cancer in both breasts, I wanted to go ahead and have a double mastectomy. He agreed and was to process the schedule with the reconstruction plastic surgeon. In the meantime, I made an appointment for a second consultation with MD Anderson in Orlando. I met with both the oncologist and then the surgeon, and both physicians felt that I was being extremely aggressive in my decision for a double mastectomy based on the results of the biopsy and felt a lumpectomy was the appropriate course of treatment with radiation. But they would do whatever I decided. After researching the statistics and talking to my family, I decided to go with the breast conservation and had a lumpectomy done on August 2. Ironically, the lab reports that came back from that surgery, which included the sentinel lymph node, indicated that ALL the cancer had been removed by the initial core biopsy done in June, and there was no finding of any cancer in the site or at the lymph node! I am now undergoing 16 days of radiation and will meet again with the oncologist to discuss hormone therapy. Through all of this, I have had minimal pain or discomfort and the only inconvenience is driving 50 miles to and from Orlando for my doctor visits and radiation treatments—no complaints on my end! So many wonderful people have been such a support to me—what a blessing. I have met numerous courageous women dealing with their cancer, been encouraged by an unbelievable number of breast cancer survivors, and have become an advocate for educating and encouraging women in my daily walk to be sure to get their annual mammograms, and if the findings are dense tissue, to seek additional screening such as the ultrasound. Had I waited another year for my next mammogram, who knows how large the tumor would have grown or how far it could have spread. Thanks to my doctor’s foresight, my cancer was caught so early that my prognosis is excellent. During this journey, I had the pleasure of getting together with one of our business clients. My husband had told her what was going on and she told us all about her cousin Jacki Donaldson and her exceptional cancer journey. As it turned out, I was given a LympheDIVAs sleeve that my friend had won in a contest. When my girlfriend (who is an OT and is trained in lymphedema therapy) was measuring me for the LympheDivas sleeve, I showed her the design I had picked out. She wondered why I was going with the lacy look that will stand out instead of a neutral skin tone color. I told her I want people to notice and hopefully ask about it so I can promote LympheDIVAs and give the elevator version of my experience and how important it is for women to be informed and know about dense breast tissue.

262,29,110,29,6,2016,2016-06-29,"There’s a little, teeny, tiny piece of me questioning whether cancer might once again live in my body. The question stems from a year’s worth of undiagnosed tummy trouble manifesting itself sometimes in simple discomfort and other times in downright pain. Some days, my stomach is tight as a drum, pushed out so far I think it’s going to pop. Other times, I feel bloated, full, and cramped. It’s all so unpredictable, and I have yet to pinpoint anything specific that is twisting up my insides. Doctors have not found any real answers, either. They did diagnose pelvic floor dysfunction, but apparently, the gut issues are a separate beast. The good news is that a battery of tests have revealed that my esophagus, cardia, pancreas, gall bladder, and a few other organs are in fine shape. That brings me peace. Really, it does. But I kinda wish the professionals could spot something, anything that might help me fix what ails me. One doc thought maybe chemo drugs were to blame, but another said it’s unlikely — if chemo drugs were to muck up my system, it would have happened at the time of treatment, not almost 8 years later. Tomorrow, I meet with my GI specialist for a round-up discussion about all of my normal test results and about what the next step will be. I fear there will be no next step, that I will just live in this state of blah, eating only minimally because it’s the only thing that makes me feel better but is surely not a healthy remedy. Cancer is not my main worry — it’s just that I’ll never totally excuse its possibility since it’s happened to me once already. Not knowing what’s wrong is my No. 1 concern.",0,1,0.02274477973007384

264,29,112,1,7,2016,2016-07-01,"I submitted this piece for publication on a blog featuring positive-outlook stories. The editors there wanted a more developed finished product. This is too rapid-fire, they shared, and apparently, it doesn’t allow the reader to fully absorb the content. I like it as is, though, so I am publishing it here instead of elsewhere. I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 34. I was a married mom of two little boys—3 years old and 18 months at the time my fingers slid across a hard, pea-sized lump in my left breast during a morning shower—and at the time, I was pretty sure my days were numbered. I was most certain of this at night when I watched my babies sleep and tried to breathe away the crushing anxiety that filled my chest. Nighttime led me to create a turnover document for my husband—you know, the kind you’d leave for the person taking over your job. Instead of explaining a workplace filing system or a list of key company people, I jotted down the names of the schools our children would attend, the best places to buy shoes for growing feet, the times at which to schedule doctor check-ups. I was prepared to leave my family, and I wanted everything in place before I departed. It’s been eight years since that November day when a doctor told me over the phone, “Unfortunately, cancer cells were found” and my medical madness began. There’s been surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, more drug therapy, physical therapy, antidepressant therapy, two hospitalizations, one blood transfusion, side effects, and more. I’ve been bald, bloated, and bitchy over the whole ordeal, but mostly, I’ve been inspired and maybe even a little thankful cancer crashed into my world (I know, gasp!) because without the disease, I might have just plodded along through life not really appreciating the beauty of every breath. My anxiety started turning to calm the day a mommy friend anonymously left a bundle of spirit-lifting books on my front porch. This gift was followed by comfy socks in my mailbox; brownies sent from across the country; meals delivered to my doorstep; a quilt lovingly crafted and autographed by friends; and a whole string of presents, flowers, cards, emails, visits, and phone calls too numerous to list. Cancer has given me more than overwhelming love from others. It gave me better hair; less stress; friendships with all sorts of cancer warriors; a writing and editing career (it all started with my ramblings on my Breast Cancer blog); a ninja-like ability to navigate the medical system for every ache, pain, itch, or twinge; a true admiration for life-saving doctors, the ability to push my body to new limits (I never thought I could run a half-marathon, but a few years ago, I did); and a relationship with my kids (now 11 and 9) that while sometimes characterized by chaos and conflict, is mostly beautiful. The beauty sinks in at night, when I watch them sleep and realize the anxiety is gone, and the turnover document has no place in our lives. Some may think I’m wacky, thinking of cancer as a gift, and I admit, if it comes back, I am certain I will change my tune. For now, though, having survived for much longer than I’d anticipated, I’m thankful. That’s all. Just thankful.",0,1,0.21232279097970588

The info-share is usually marked by intimate, gross, and disgusting life details, typically broadcast in writing where anyone can see them—you know, like on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. I tend to blurt out my personal details, which most always have a medical undertone, because (a) I think that what I publish can help others (case in point: this blog, where hundreds of people visit each day for information about breast cancer and a reminder that people, like me, do survive the disease, even after harrowing experiences) and (b) I know that what I publish helps me (case in point: this blog, where, over the span of almost eight years, bunches of well-wishers have lifted my spirits and led me to resources for better living. Oversharing is probably expected on a breast cancer blog, where details and graphic photos (like the one of my boobs all marked up and ready for radiation) are key for raising awareness. Lately, though, my tendency to overshare has funneled over to Facebook. Here’s what I wrote today: For those who love a good medical update — A dose of propofol (yes, the Michael Jackson drug), a tube and camera down the throat, a biopsy of a few parts, a groggy wake-up, and now I’m home. Findings are as follows: gastritis, duodenitis, hiatus hernia, and some iffy mucous in pancreas. Next up: MRI to investigate pancreas thing + a follow-up with doc to determine course of action. The good news is that my esophagus and cardia (the opening that connects the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach) are normal. Well, that’s good, right?

Having a sleeve on hand is key—it’s one of the tried and true therapies for lymphedema. Now that I have my newbie, I’m thinking it might become more fashion accessory than cancer-surviving burden.

One of these women—Rachel Levin Troxell—pushed that hot, thick, itchy, beige compression garment option into the shadows by launching some comfortable, breathable, aloe-vera infused, and fashionable arm candy. Seriously, isn’t my arm beautiful? Sadly, Rachel passed away in 2008, but her creation lives on, thanks to her dad and brother, who are working to fulfill Rachel’s mission to bring lymphedema awareness to the breast cancer community and beyond.

She tested me for celiac disease. Nope, not that, either, although I did follow a gluten-free diet for a couple of months thinking maybe it would help. It did not. There were other tests I could have taken — one would track an egg moving through my body — but my tummy troubles subsided, and so did my pursuit of an answer. Eventually, the discomfort came back, then it went away, and this has been the pattern for quite some time now. If I eat healthy, my stomach sometimes hurts. If I eat junky, my stomach sometimes hurts. Often, the pain is so great it makes me want to cry, and at night, I curl up in the fetal position and will myself to sleep. I usually feel better in the morning. To try to cure myself, I’ve played with what I eat and how I eat. I’ve found some recipes that soothe my system — my favorite is a brown rice cake with peanut better and sliced red grapes on top — and I’ve eliminated a few items I believe were twisting up my insides (lettuce). Still, although I can go weeks without symptoms, they always sneak up and cause me at least a day’s worth of sick. This is why I contacted the internist again. She referred me to a GI specialist. I saw her today. My new doctor believes the culprit might be chemo drugs, which could have mucked up my system. Antigen was the word the doc threw around, and she has ordered a bunch of blood tests, plus a surgical procedure to take a biopsy of some of my intestines and stomach. I will also submit to another test, which will hopefully explain some issues that might be related to my big ‘ol babies (10 pounds, 9 ounces and 10 pounds, 2 ounces). They probably did a number on my pelvic health, my GI friend said, so this test will help investigate further. I went to the doctor today hoping she wouldn’t just throw meds my way in an attempt to mask what’s going on. She didn’t. For that, I am grateful. She wants to locate the cause of my complaints — I like that. I also went to the doctor today in no way suspecting cancer treatment might come up the guilty party.

There’s just no need for a such a drastic and major surgery, he said. The resident on service with him agreed. I told my doc that it seems a trend that woman are removing their breasts after diagnosis rather than saving them when conservation is a real option. “It is a trend,” he said, sharing that he spends lots of hours in lots of meeting discussing why women are moving in this direction. If not medically necessary, mastectomy is just not something he supports. He even advises women who do need mastectomy for cancer in one breast to not remove the other one. Why?

291,29,139,28,7,2016,2016-07-28,"By: David Haas Whether you have just been diagnosed with cancer, are undergoing treatments, or are in remission, the benefits of keeping fit cannot be understated. Exercise keeps the body healthy and functioning at its highest capacity, and for bodies fighting a rigorous chronic disease like cancer, exercise can make a tremendous positive difference. When my doctor first told me I had mesothelioma, I felt like there was nothing I could do, but he encouraged me to get off my sofa and start exercising, even for a short time daily, so I could make a positive change. Conventionally, healthcare professionals have encouraged cancer patients and survivors to ‘take it easy,’ but Ciaran Devane, chief executive officer (CEO) of Macmillan Cancer Support, stated in an article posted by CBS News that patients would be shocked to know the benefits of physical activity on their recovery and long-term health. Decreased Risk of Recurrence Studies indicate that for those who have beat cancer, exercise can help keep the disease from coming back. In a recent article posted by webMD, Kerry Courneya, professor from Canada and research chair at the Physical Activity and Cancer organization in Edmonton, Canada, stated that not only did exercise reduce the risk of recurrence, but it also ensured a longer survival after diagnosis. Elevated Energy Levels Exercise is known to reduce fatigue and increase overall energy levels. It also increases stamina. Cancer treatment can be rigorous, and exercise helps build the muscle and stamina needed to better withstand its effects on the body. Improved Quality of Life Exercise reduces the risk of other chronic illnesses, like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while decreasing the risk of other health issues, like osteoporosis and depression. It also enhances mood by releasing serotonin, a ‘feel-good’ chemical in the brain, and produces an overall positive feeling of well-being. Even a little effort at fitness can go a long way while living with or beyond cancer. It doesn’t need to be anything too strenuous. Small choices like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, gardening instead of watching television, or walking the dog instead of playing a computer game make a tremendous overall positive impact on living. Thank you, David, for this reminder that exercise is powerful medicine!",0,1,0.05334625052366989

296,29,143,1,8,2016,2016-08-01,"So, here is what you should know about MRI: Your MRI will pick up everything. Great if you have certain types of breast cancer, because they will likely be detected, and this could save your life. Bummer if it’s not cancer, because you’ll be forced to chase it down like it is cancer in order to confirm that it’s not, and this could take a really long time, and even if it doesn’t take a really long time, it will seem like forever, and you will worry and fret and panic until you find answers. Your MRI should be scheduled for a day that is between something like seven and 15 days after the onset of your period. This is very important. Should you schedule off this track, your MRI (remember, it will pick up everything) will zero in on all sorts of hormonal tissue changes, and this could lead a concerned radiologist to indicate in test results that “malignancy is considered.” Get where I’m headed here? In a nutshell, I caution you to (a) realize MRI is a very sensitive screening tool, and (b) make sure you are scheduled properly when you plan to use this very sensitive screening tool. If (a) and (b) converge, you might have a stressful time on your hands, like I just did. Why for my past five MRIs no one has ever asked about my cycles when scheduling me, I will never know. And WOW, how lucky I’ve been for all those five times to not have happen to me what happened last Thursday. You see, my period started the day after my last-week MRI, and it looks like this just skewed everything. Yesterday’s MRI, though, implemented properly, apparently showed that the worrisome issues had resolved. <sigh> No. <big sigh> You just can’t imaging how relieved I am, given the fact that seven years ago TODAY, I had a biopsy for a lump I’d found in my left breast. The next day, the day before Thanksgiving, a doctor called me to say, “unfortunately, cancer cells were found.” That just can’t happen twice, with such precise timing. It just can’t. And it didn’t.

298,29,145,3,8,2016,2016-08-03,"Today, I met with a breast surgeon to review what’s happened over the past almost-week. To recap: there was the annual MRI. then the MRI report featuring the awful words “malignancy considered.” then three days of pure worry (and lots of well wishes and prayers). then an ultrasound that prompted docs to utter the happy word, “benign.” then another couple of days of pondering it all. then this afternoon’s consultation with the guy who operates on women with breast cancer. First of all, who knew the gowns had gotten so lovely in the past seven years. Wow, check out my beautiful blue poncho-style paper cover-up, complete with hanging-open sides that are just perfect for peering in at boobs and muffin tops. It didn’t really matter, though, how substantial that pretty paper is because in a matter of minutes, I was on the exam table, boobs fully naked and prime for examination. And here’s what I learned about the troublesome twosome: They feel fine. No lumps, bumps, masses, or tumors. No thickening or dimpling or other changes in the skin. Maybe a little nipple redness (we’ll monitor that). No swollen lymph nodes. No infection. No inflammation. No apparent cause for concern. The game plan: The surgeon will review my MRI and ultrasound Monday morning at a weekly “breast conference,” where all sorts of doctors converge and weigh in on cases. While he’s at the meeting, I’ll be getting a re-do MRI, and he says if it looks better than the first, we’ll sum up that I am A-OK, and I will check back with him in January. If it looks the same as the first, we’ll call it a mystery and continue digging by way of MRI-guided biopsy. No matter what, I’ll watch the nipple (not, like, every two minutes, though, the surgeon said), and I’ll report any continued or worsening redness. I learned so much from the surgeon today, like if I ever get cancer in my right breast, it won’t be a spread of the cancer I had in the left breast, because cancer doesn’t spread from one breast to the other. It would be another new cancer, and the chances of that happening are something like .5% per year. I also learned that MRI catches more than 95 percent of invasive breast cancers (there are others, but these are the types that present as lumps). Awesome, right? Of course it is, but the bummer side to the story is that MRI picks up everything else, too. And what the heck does one do about that? Chase it all down, that’s what, just like I’m doing right now, to see if the iffy stuff turned up by that loud and annoying tube is cancer-related in any way, shape, or form. No fun, I admit, but it’s a necessary evil — unless of course, the boobs go away, which is totally an option, and thanks so much to everyone for sharing opinions on whether or not I should just chop the breasts right off (well, the surgeon would do it, not me). Still thinking on that one, but I’ll keep you posted. Today was a good day. No pure worry, but still plenty of well wishes and prayers, and news that is more hopeful than not.

311,29,158,16,8,2016,2016-08-16,"Sometimes, I feel guilty for surviving cancer because some people are not so lucky. Why did I get a break when so many, like Amy, did not? There’s nothing fair about the way it happened, the way Amy died just 15 months after a breast cancer diagnosis seemingly similar to mine. She heard the same string of chilling words—you have cancer—as I did, just months after a doctor hurled them at me, over the phone, a day before Thanksgiving. Both in our early 30s with husbands and small children, Amy and I felt like two peas in a pod, situated in what we believed were almost identical positions. We were both young, both with early stage breast cancer. We both knew our cancers, while caught early, were considered aggressive because of our age—young women tend to have aggressive forms of the disease—but we also knew we had a high likelihood of survival, about 93% for at least five years. Amy and I had common hopes, fears, and worries, and, on several occasions, we cried tears we were sure flowed from the same well. We also shared an instant urge to reach others with our breast cancer stories. Amy welcomed local newspaper reporters into her world and allowed them to capture through words and photographs her most intimate cancer moments. I began authoring my own breast cancer blog and then ventured into the world of freelance writing. We both wanted to make our experiences matter. And judging by the flood of reaction we received from our combined efforts, it’s clear we did. Amy and I shared victories—we both managed to escape the threat of lymph node involvement—and we shared cards and e-mails. Thank you for holding my hand through this journey—it would have been pretty lonely without you, Amy wrote in one e-mail. Amy and I also shared care packages, family photos, even hats. If misery loves company, then Amy and I were in love. And in celebration of our love, we basked in the glory of our most important similarity—our cancers had not spread. This was key to our survival. Or so we thought. A mutual friend—her high school buddy and my college roommate—matched Amy and me. Ericha was one of a few close friends who after my diagnosis offered to hop on a plane and come to my rescue in Florida. I never accepted her offer—I was sure I could handle cancer all on my own—and so she stayed in Ohio where Amy, also an Ohio girl, welcomed her assistance. It worked out well this way. Ericha helped Amy as she recovered from surgery, reconstruction, chemotherapy, and countless physical and emotional twists. She watched Amy’s kids—ages 4 and 1 at the time—and cleaned her house and drove her to appointments and selflessly assumed some of the burden drowning this young wife and mother who continued working as a nurse while managing a life with cancer. “I quit my job,” Amy told me just after she announced her cancer had returned. She said she should have quit after her first diagnosis. She should have taken better care of herself. She should have played with her children, spent time with her husband, given up the chore of work. She would do it right this time, she said. She would crush cancer. She was sure of it. I wrote and published a post about Amy on The Cancer Blog just after she told me how cancer had shown up in her brain and lungs, just five months after her chemotherapy for breast cancer ended. I wrote about my shattered hope, my fear this would happen to me, my complete and total sadness. And then Amy left a comment on my post. She wrote: Jacki, I am not giving up. I will beat this again. Don’t you give up yet. I have Luke and Ella and they alone are worth fighting for. Just everyone send me your prayers and positive vibes. Quoting the cancer crusade couple, “Setbacks are a chance to pause and review the lesson of life.” Amy, the one staring down death—doctors said she had two to 12 months to live—was comforting me. Amy, with her spunk and spirit, convinced me she would annihilate this evil disease. I believed her. Amy lived for only five weeks after she wrote these words. Ericha called me with the news of her death just as I was leaving my house one Saturday morning to run in a race. I stopped in my tracks when Ericha told me—Amy passed yesterday—and I felt nothing but shock and sorrow for the duration of the run I struggled to finish. I finished for Amy, though. If she could fight cancer—twice—then I could surely pound out a few miles in honor of a friend whose face I never did see. Amy and I talked about meeting at the beach with our families one day after we’d survived cancer for a few years. We dreamed of going on the Oprah show and proudly announcing our survivorship. We talked about a lot in our short 15-month friendship. What we didn’t talk about was that our situations really were very different. Perhaps we weren’t aware of it at the time. Perhaps we subconsciously chose to find common ground in the midst of our harrowing journeys, to ignore the fact that we were not traveling the same path at all. Amy had a family history of breast cancer. I did not. Just after Amy completed her chemotherapy, her mother was diagnosed with the same disease that now has affected four generations in her family. Additionally, Amy’s tumor was slightly larger than mine, she received a different chemotherapy protocol than I received, she was not eligible for a year-long drug treatment I accepted to keep cancer at bay and because she had chosen the radical route of removing both of her breasts—I had a lumpectomy—Amy was not a top candidate for the radiation therapy that zapped me five days per week for seven weeks. She wondered if she should have demanded this treatment. She wondered if it would have made a difference in her survival. The final and perhaps most significant difference in our diseases is that while Amy’s cancer, like mine, had not spread to her lymph nodes, it had found a way to penetrate her bloodstream and was spreading in a secret, silent, and deadly fashion. My oncologist, who dried my tears when I sobbed about the unfairness of Amy’s death, said some young women have a very aggressive disease right away. Amy was one of these women. I, apparently, am not. There’s nothing fair about the way it happened, how Amy died just 15 months after a breast cancer diagnosis I have now survived for almost four years, how Amy died so quickly and I didn’t, how there is no cure for this mysterious disease that strikes far too many women and some men too. Amy’s husband sent me an e-mail just after she died. He wrote: You were a great inspiration to Amy. Your quote ” Fight the Good Fight” was front and center on our fridge. Please don’t let this news get you down, Amy would want your chin up, would want you to keep fighting. Thanks for all your support. My chin is up. I am fighting.

Because when my friend who happens to spend his days hunting down a cure for cancer told me that the 1 in 8 chance of getting breast cancer is a lifetime risk and not a risk for every woman at every age, I was sorta shocked. And way relieved. My friend directed me to the National Cancer Institute, where I located some facts about the often-thrown-around statistic, and here is what I learned: cancer.gov If you are 30 years old, you have a 1 in 233 chance of developing breast cancer in the next 10 years, a 1 in 54 chance in the next 20 years, a 1 in 24 chance in the next 30 years, and a 1 in 8 chance in your lifetime. Did I have a 1 in 8 chance at age 34? Nope. I still got the disease, yes (which means I’m pretty unlucky, I guess), but my chances were not as great as one might believe. Now, your risk does increase as you age (because, as my friend told me, cancer is mostly a disease of older people), but, still, even a 70-year-old woman has a 1 in 27 chance of getting breast cancer in the next 10 years. Not 1 in 8. I am not here to minimize in any way the fact that breast cancer strikes far too many women of all ages, and I realize there are risk factors that change the odds listed above, but, I do appreciate a little perspective.

Her words follow, and see that photo to the right? That’s her — the girl I first met when we were something like 25 years old, and, now, we’re something like 40. Oh, and the “cancer-surviving friend” in the story — that’s me! My First Mammogram Heather Dilatush I just had my second mammogram. I really don’t mind going to the doctor or dentist – I like staying on top of my health, but I did skip last year’s mammogram and I think I know why. Two years ago, I went for my first “mammo.” People will probably not believe this, but I wasn’t nervous or worried about the pain that sometimes accompanies getting “squished.” I figured that if it hurt, I would take some deep breaths and get through it. As my cancer-surviving friend said, getting squished may hurt, but cancer hurts more. But first, let me put that time in a little context. I was getting my mammo at the start of a new school year. Although I was heading into my sixth year of teaching, I was thrown into teaching photography. I am a skilled artist, but I confess, I am not a photographer. I don’t even have a background in photography. Zippo, ziltch, nadda. So I was about to learn in front of 16-year-olds. I know, fun, right? It was one of the few times in my life when I felt like I didn’t know which end was up. Everybody kept telling me I was a great art teacher and I would be good. But like all teachers, I like to know my stuff really, super double extra well so that I can teach the hell out of it. Where do you start when you don’t know anything? And another confession: I have no passion for it. I appreciate it; my partner is a great photographer, my dad had a darkroom in our basement, but that particular artform does almost nothing for me. It makes no sense, I know. So like a good 39-year-old, I went in for my mammogram and was greeted and fondled by a very nice woman. I got squished, and it was fine. She said that sometimes people have to come in a second time, but that 80% of the time it is just to get some better shots. I thought that made sense. And I remember thinking I could never do her job. I am scared to death of my new position, but I could never work as a technician. Sometimes you have to smile at the patient knowing that something is abnormal in those images. I got the call that I needed to come in for some more images. This time, I was more nervous because I had been trying all week to plan lessons for something I had no clue about. When my students’ film doesn’t come out, why doesn’t it? And if you have ever shot photography, is it me or is learning aperture a little tricky? Oh, and darkroom chemicals, how do those work? I felt like a fraud. Also that week, when I went into our finance office to order some supplies, I looked at Cheryl’s desk full of purchase orders, mounds of paperwork-filled columns and numbers and stuff, and said, “I could never do your job.” She said chuckling, “well, I could never be a teacher, so we’re even.” I was feeling so scattered that when I showed up for the second mammogram, I realized I had forgotten my wallet when I went to get my money for the co-pay. They took me anyway, and when I was in the room with the technician, she said, “I will let you know that this is not going to be very pleasant.” Ugh, okay. I thought to myself, just breath, it’s all you can do. She was right. It was not pleasant. But it still wasn’t really the worst pain I have ever experienced. I used it as a time to practice breathing. But it still happened. I panicked. I realized that she was trying to get a particular shot. There was an area of my breast that she kept squeezing the heck out of. I closed my eyes and thought about my breathing. I assume she had no idea that I was concerned. I went back to the dressing room to get dressed and was on the verge of tears. Just as I finished pulling my shirt over my head, a woman with a beautiful, warm face and handshake said in a run-on sentence, “Hi Heather, I am Doctor Bryant we will see you next year everything is fine.” When she left, I thought, I could NEVER do HER job. I went out to my car and wept. I was both relieved and upset about the upcoming year. Somehow I would get through it. Maybe I would use it as a year to breath.",0,1,0.26031201502899615

346,29,192,19,9,2016,2016-09-19,"Image: cancerbooksource.com I have a new book, and it’s called “Defeat Cancer: 15 Doctors of Integrative and Naturopathic Medicine Tell You How.” I grabbed this Connie Strasheim paperback from my mailbox one day just as I was taking my boys to flag football practice. In the car went the book, and when I finally plopped down in my red football-mom chair, I cracked open this insightful resource, which kept me reading and wanting to alert anyone who would listen that cancer treatment can involve so much more than cutting, poisoning, and scorching. I didn’t alert the masses that day, just my husband, who sat captive next to me in his own folding chair, but I intend to share some wisdom right now. So, keep reading, then pass it on. I guess I should start by saying that I, myself, was cut, poisoned, and scorched. And if I had to do it all over again, I think I would follow a similar path, because ditching conventional treatment altogether just makes me nervous, and I’m afraid the result could be tragic. That’s not to say I don’t believe there’s a place for alternative methods of healing, and that’s why I like my book — it offers 15 different views on conquering cancer, some hard-core anti-traditional ideas, some not so drastic, all eye-opening. Consider these few points: Cookie-cutter treatments do not work for most patients, but that’s kinda what we get in most cancer centers and hospitals. I know I did, and it’s partly why I fired one oncologist and hired another — the first one told me I needed X, Y, and Z, because that’s what the research said I needed. Doc No. 2 said I didn’t need all that she had prescribed. She was a statistics person — if the computer spit out a recommendation, she took it. He was an intuition person. He reviewed my options, shared his thoughts, and together, we picked what seemed most effective for me. It seems to be working, because I’m alive six years later, even after declining a scary drug I knew I didn’t want to take. While conventional medicine has proven useful for treating some cancers, for most types, it doesn’t do so well. More than 250 billion dollars have been spent on cancer research over the past 60 years, and the cure rate hasn’t improved much since 1960. Clearly, something is not right here. Even when traditional treatments are used, they are typically inadequate and lack a holistic approach. What about dietary modifications, for example? Why don’t docs talk much about eating for health and healing? Cancer represents a failure of the immune system. Boosting this system through diet — because we are a far more toxic and nutritionally depleted country than every before — and immune support (oral and IV) can make a difference, maybe even provide a cure. There is so much more packed into the pages of this book, and I can’t possibly do it service here in this post, which is probably getting a little long, right? Might I recommend you grab yourself a copy, and see for yourself how complex the world of cancer treatment really is.

Aware of the recent cell phone/cancer conversation? That’s the sorta stuff Krista is talking about. Read on, and you’ll see. (And thank you, Krista, for sharing your words!) In many cases, some people believe the bridge between environmental toxins and health issues like cancer to be somewhat overstated. Unfortunately, this could not be more false. In everyday life, there are nearly 100,000 different chemicals being used all over the world. Of that 100,000, only a few hundred have actually been tested for their ability to cause cancer. In just the small amount of testing of those few hundred, there have been numerous ties to cancer-causing chemicals. The effect of chemicals and toxic materials on cancer cases can also be tied to the high amount of cases in elderly people. As people age, the body’s ability to metabolize and remove chemicals is reduced. These chemicals can stay around in an older body and cause more problems and health risks. Even though awareness should always be high for environmental toxins, the elderly should have an extra eye on the dangers. In 2010, the President’s Cancer Panel (an advisory group on cancer) called for more research on environmentally related cancer and toxins. They claimed that while there is some evidence of long-term effects, without research, the true burden of environmentally related cancer will be extremely underestimated. The panel pointed towards some ways to cut down on the risk of these toxins in the near future. This includes filtering tap water and not using plastic plates, as well as eating food without pesticides or fertilizers and processed meat. They claimed that cutting down cell phone use, reducing radiation exposure, and checking home radon levels as other important recommendations to reduce these health risks. The actual types of cancer are not to be taken lightly, and one of the most vulnerable places can be inside or around the house. Houses have been key spots for exposure to radon, asbestos, and as a result, mesothelioma. Radon can rise up from the ground, while asbestos material is a common fiber found in many older insulation and homes. These risks are not to be disregarded as there is no mesothelioma cure, making asbestos exposure highly dangerous. Some may come away from these reports and believe that they overstate or scare people about cancer. It’s not intended to do that, but it simply shows the importance of being aware and taking steps to help prevent any of these risks in the future. Emphasis on the panel’s recommendations will not only have a positive effect in cutting down environmental cancer risk, but also in improving health in general.

It helps prepare people; it sometimes minimizes fear. The surgeon told me I could not keep my port. My sedation was kicking in, and I did not have it in me to argue. Yesterday, a different surgeon removed a stent from my ureter. He had placed it there 3 days earlier during kidney stone surgery. The stent helps with healing and allows urine and stone fragments to pass freely. It is a painful little bugger, and I was thrilled that the doctor yanked it out. “Do you want to keep it?” the nurse asked me. “Hmmm, I wasn’t allowed to keep my port,” I said. “Why? my doctor asked. “You paid for it.” I do not know why I was not permitted to take my port home, but I am now the proud owner of a ureter stent.

It looks like this: Click on the image to land at iVillage (I'm slide No. 7) And here’s the whole story: I first felt like a real mom after pushing a 10 pound, 9 ounce baby boy from my body, and I was reminded of my motherhood when baby boy No. 2 arrived, weighing slightly less, yet still more than 10 pounds. “WOW-I’m-a-mom” thoughts continued with every feeding, sleepless night, and overwhelming moment of love and tenderness. But nothing registered a bigger “WOW” than finding out I had cancer, and realizing that mothering two growing boys had more implications than I’d ever thought possible. Joey (the biggest boy) was almost 4 years old when a doctor revealed the mass I found in my left breast was malignant, and Danny (the smaller and younger of the two) was 18 months old. My first reaction after the dreaded phone call (“unfortunately, cancer cells were found”) was, “OMG, what if I die and leave these guys without a mom?” Nothing scared me more, and every time I looked at my precious bundles, my gut twisted and turned. Maybe I wouldn’t die, but how would I care for kids while puking and pouting about my bad luck. Cancer would probably be easier without kids, I decided in the beginning, and then I quickly changed my mind — my kids were the key to my fight, they would save me. And they did — save me. Their innocent, simple, and honest approach to life kept me peaceful (most of the time). “It’s only a haircut,” declared Joey while helping shave my head after hair started tumbling from my scalp. And Danny, too young to have a clue about my cancer crusade, helped me keep life as normal as possible. Playgroups, preschool, and family vacations (in the midst of chemo, radiation, and two hospital stays) were not uncommon, and I never did vomit or become as depressed as I’d predicted. Now, don’t get me wrong — cancer did suck. But so did birthing monster-sized children. The point is that life got better. The pain of having babies faded, and those beauties who tore through my body made it clear that the pain of cancer would become blurry, too. And blurry, it is.

I was out in an instant and slept for nearly three hours. You’d think I’d have trouble sleeping that night, but I didn’t — I was out cold for nine hours.

Like 1.1 (size of my breast cancer tumor in centimeters), 1 (stage of my disease), 4 (number of lymph nodes removed), 12 (number of Herception infusions I received), 93 (percentage that predicted my survival for 5 years). The numbers go on and on. There were enough numbers to cover the floor and tables of the space where I spoke this morning to two small groups of Univesity of Florida medical school applicants. The purpose of my talk was to bring to life my numbers, to demonstrate that for each digit strewn across the place, there is a story. Like 18, which represents the months I spent in counseling trying to wrangle the tears that continually poured from my eyes and anxieties about living to see my baby boys grow up. And 2, which is the sum of my individual hospital stays that lasted for 10 total days. I talked about the first low blood counts (700) that landed me on the bone marrow floor (because the oncology floor was full) and earned me a blood transfusion, the second low blood counts (1200) that recovered much more quickly and without donor assistance, and the 4 infusions of chemotherapy that robbed me of my hair but gave me 10 extra pounds. I also shared some happy stories. Like how my blog reaches 80-plus countries, how my wig has traveled across the United States 4 times so that other women could benefit from the comfort it gave me, how I now have a 0 chance of recurrence because my cancer only returns in the first 5 years, and how I will have survived for 10 years in November. I was 34 when I was diagnosed. Now, I am 44. My kids, then 3 and 18 months old, are now 13 and 11. I do love numbers. They fascinate me. But they do not reveal sadness, suffering, pain, hope, joy, relief. Patients are so much more than the numbers that fill their charts, and my message to today’s applicants was this: Find a way to personally connect with those you will treat. The connection does not need to be long or lasting; it just must be meaningful. If these applicants attend the University of Florida for medical school, they would be wise to model the manner of Dr. Lynch (pictured right)—my warm and loving oncologist and friend—who continues to invite me to speak during interview days because he thinks it is critical for prospective students to learn about real-life medical journeys so that they can become compassionate patient-centered physicians. I think he is right. After my chat, one applicant shook my hand and tenderly said, “I will definitely think about things differently now.

We hit if off, had a lot of laughs, got in little bits of trouble (noise violations, just noise!), and we managed to stay connected over the years. I can’t even remember the last time I saw her, but our Facebook chats leave me feeling like not much time or distance separates us. Ericha is joining me in my 5K challenge (she runs in Ohio, and I run in Florida), and for the past few days, we’ve been posting on each other’s FB walls about our progress. We’ve inspired a few others who have decided to pound the pavement, and we’ve got lots of friends commenting on our respective strides. I love it.

Being a single mom to 4, with no other family, I was petrified I would leave my children without a mother. I had also just lost my mother, a non-smoker, to lung cancer only a few months before. My grandmother had died from breast cancer, my dad, sister, and best friend all to cancer. I began researching everything I could online. All of the articles were basically the same, but then I came across a blog — a blog I could relate to, a blog that gave me hope. But after a car accident, being pronounced cancer-free, other minor stressors, and life just “happening,” I forgot about the blog. Last night I pulled out my old laptop that I hadn’t used since November, and started cleaning out the files. Lo’ and behold, there was the blog. Curious as to what was happening with the author, I opened it. Immediately I realized it was the same blog Ericha had posted on her FB wall! It was YOU! I just want to thank you for getting me through a very difficult time in my life. I had you on my church prayer list, and prayed for you daily. I am sure I’m not the only one who was encouraged and motivated by your words. Not only did you motivate me to keep on keeping on, you prepared me for what was yet to come, and gave me HOPE.

Well, reality changed. I got cancer, and I got to lose all my hair. Devastating, it was, maybe even worse than the cancer itself and its treacherous treatments. There was one little silver lining, though — the bangs were gone. And the golden opportunity presented itself: I could grow my hair all over again, and I would not cut bangs — never, ever, again. And for six years, I didn’t. Until today, when I went to my hair stylist and told her, “I want bangs.” It wasn’t an easy decision, but it was the best one. My bangs are longish, and I’ll sweep them to the side — these are not your traditional straight-across variety. I like how they frame my face, how they add some style, how they look warm and chocolate-y with some new chunky highlights, how they’ll hide the wrinkles that will inevitably appear more visible on my forehead.

She was a Facebook friend, a sister blogger, a hard-core survivor. Daria was diagnosed in 2000 at the age of 39 — why do people insist that breast cancer is not a young woman’s disease? — and she was treated with radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Then her cancer recurred in her chest area, and then another lump was found in her breast, and then it showed up in her lungs, liver, and bones. As a result, Daria was living on chemotherapy, and had been since August 2008. Remarkable, she was, digging up the latest news and views on breast cancer and sharing all of it for her Facebook friends, blogging her daily triumphs and troubles, inspiring women all over the world. And then on January 20, Daria’s husband told her loyal readers that she was no longer able to write. On January 21, he shared that she was resting comfortably but was losing touch. Today, he wrote, “I was by her side and was able to kiss her goodbye several times during the night and then watched her slip away quietly in her sleep.” Daria is no longer in pain.

I compare. It can be a dangerous proposition, because I’ve yet to find someone with my exact same diagnosis, prognosis, treatment plan, side effects, and on, and on, and on — and until I do, it’s just plain silly to think I will ever follow in another woman’s footsteps.

She shared with me the following letter her cousin wrote three years ago, near the anniversary of her diagnosis. Nina Matthews Photography, Flickr Dear Cancer, Wow … can you believe that it has been eight years since we first met? Some days it seems as if it was only yesterday. I have so many mixed feelings about our relationship, it is truly a love/ hate situation. I hate the fact that we ever had to meet but in some strange way I love that we can live together and I am grateful for some of the things that you have taught me over the years. I need to touch on the reasons for my hatred towards you, you have taken so many things from me. Whether you know it or not you have taken away a part of my daughter’s childhood — she has been forced to deal with situations that only grown ups should have to deal with. You have made it really difficult for me to have certain dreams and goals for fear that I may never realize them. You have stolen my ability to have more children and build a larger family. You have physically beaten me down time and time again not to mention the emotional toll that you take on me on a daily basis. From day one you have been on my mind every day and as much as I want to forget the fact that I know you it is impossible. There are days when I wake up and my hatred for you is almost overwhelming, it may be that I am sick of going to all of these appointments, or that I am tired of being in pain or it might be as simple as me missing being able to be a free spirit and not having our “friendship” always hanging over my head. I wish I could for one moment forget that we ever met … but the reality is that we did .. for reasons that I will never understand and truthfully never fully accept. For eight long years I have done my best to get rid of you and just wonder why you are so damn persistent. I mean I know that I am a fun person to hang around with but sometimes you just have to take a hint! Don’t get me wrong I am very thankful for the lessons you have taught me. You have shown me how to love unconditionally, how to forgive completely, how to always have hope and embrace the little things in life. You have opened my eyes to so many beautiful things in this world that one can only appreciate after having known you. You have given me the drive to help others who are in similar situations, to give of myself and make a difference in the lives of others and I will never forget that. It looks like we are in this together for the long haul whether I like it or not and I am accepting of this, but you had better be prepared because well the truth is I can be a bitch at times and I am used to getting my way. I don’t give up easy and am always up for a good fight. Did I mention that I have great friends and family behind me every step of the way? Well, I do and we are a package deal so just be prepared … we can get crazy at times! For the past eight years I have wondered off and on why you chose me? I no longer want to know why, the fact is that for whatever reason you did and it is up to me how I deal with it. Every day will be a challenge and I am prepared for this. As much as I don’t like you, you have ultimately made me a stronger person and being strong is what will carry me through. Here’s to at least another eight years!

I’m not sure of the exact type, but it started in one place, landed in another, and was called melanoma in the late stages. Regardless, the whole story makes me cry. We were standing in a place called Sun Country — where kids take gymnastics, ballet, karate, and more — when this friend first told me about her dad’s diagnosis. I think we both kind of thought, “yea, cancer, he’ll be OK.” Because, a lot of people are. It’s a rough road — the surgery, treatment, and all — but surely, he’d survive it, I thought. He did survive — for a while. Then things got bad. There were hospital stays, and feeding tubes, and weight loss. Doctors said there wasn’t anything more they could do for him. Hospice came to his house. And two days after Thanksgiving, he passed. I am confident he is at peace now, finished with the hardships of cancer. That’s a good thing. What makes me sad is that he wasn’t OK, which means, even though I’ve survived my own cancer for 6 years, it’s quite possible I won’t be alright forever. I’ve had a good long run, but what if that ends? That’s what cancer does. It first invades the body, and then it leaves a lingering unknown. Sometimes — like today, as I think of my friend’s dad — it makes me sad. Mostly, though, it keeps me on my toes, keeps me aware of every breath I take, keeps me in awe of all the blessings in my life.

Since I can’t comment on it, though, how about I share someone else’s take? OK. I’ll do that. Writer Mary Valle’s “That’s Cancertainment” reveals that she’s not all that happy about media portrayals of cancer. She, herself a breast cancer survivor, believes shows like “The Big C,” and other outlets for communicating with the public, glamorize the disease, when really, it’s not all that pretty. Pretty hot, eh? Ads for “The Big C” have actress Laura Linney “in the top part of an hourglass, in a come-hither pose, high heels kicked up behind her, lookin’ all smug and sexy with a beach ball,” writes Valle. “The sand is, of course, running into the bottom of the glass. Because she has cancer, get it? Time is running out! But the look on her face says ‘Oh my God, you guys, the cancer? Is totally scary? But now that I might die sooner rather than later? I am having a total blast! It’s weirdly kinda fun (and sexy!)'” Valle understands that disease can be a great opportunity for personal growth and liberation. What she doesn’t get: the suggestion that it’s actually fun, and sexy. “Cancer is bad enough without feeling exploited on top of it,” she declares. Shame on Showtime — not because I have personally experienced their inaccuracies, but because Valle has. And I think her concerns are right on!",0,1,0.16850446428571425

It happened to me, and I kindly declined the advice, knowing in my heart and gut that I had to travel the medical path. I’m not saying alternative options don’t have a place in a treatment plan — I mean, I’m definitely an advocate of revamping diets and fitness regimes in the name of survival — but saying ‘No’ to the likes of surgery, chemo, and radiation just wasn’t something I wanted to try. But Hollie and Patrick Quinn did try. Together, they rejected conventional cancer treatment, and things seem to be working out just fine. It’s been eight years since Hollie was diagnosed, and she is living quite well. There’s a whole lot more to this story, and you might want to pick up a copy of the Quinn’s book, “You Did What? Saying ‘No’ to Conventional Cancer Treatment.” To view of trailer of the book, and to check out other resources, simply click here. Then tell me: Could you say ‘No’ to chemo?

My life was stressful, but terrific. I had sold Baby Einstein to Disney and was financially lucky, and I was in the midst of filming a video for my new company, The Safe Side. I was raising my daughters, and I was happy and healthy. I ate well and worked out most days. Can you share a bit about your diagnoses and treatments? When I found the lump in my breast the first time, I was ‘lucky’ because the disease was stage 1. The tumor was under 1cm in size, and it had not visibly spread to my lymph nodes. Though a lumpectomy was recommended, I opted for a double mastectomy. I was devastated by the cancer, and wanted to assure that this would never happen to me again. Unfortunately, it still did. In 2008 I found another small lump on my chest wall. When I learned that the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes and liver, I was in shock. I heard the words Stage 4 in relation to me, and I couldn’t believe it. I did chemo and Herceptin (another cancer treatment) for five months, and came out with no evidence of disease — the best news I could expect. Now it’s about maintenance. Trying to stay in this place. I had my ovaries out, because my cancer was estrogen positive. I take a medication called Femara to help shut down any additional estrogen from my body. I have osteoporosis in my spine and neck from early, forced menopause, but I’m here. And thankful to be so. How old were your kids when you were first diagnosed, and how did they handle the cancer news? They were six and nine the first time, and eleven and thirteen the second time. The first time they were young, and I was really optimistic that I’d caught it early and eradicated it. The second time was harder. They were older, and had a better understanding of what it could mean. They knew people died from cancer. And chemotherapy was worse to watch than surgery, because I really looked sick. That’s when I saw the need for a book like You Are the Best Medicine. How did you deal with having a recurrence (mentally, physically and emotionally)? Anxiety. Fear. Depression. Shock. I still feel these emotions, but I also feel hopeful. I feel grateful for the beautiful life that I have, and lucky to have my current health status. What “aha” moment led you to write “You Are the Best Medicine”? I’ve never seen myself as a very brave person. I don’t deal well with physical pain. But I knew that I would be brave and strong because I wanted to be around for my children, and I wanted them to know how much they were a part of my strength and hope. I wrote the book because I wanted to give other people with cancer a way to tell their children the same important message. What do you hope is the end result of having written this book? I hope it will help kids understand how much their love means. And I hope to raise $100,000 for the research team at UCLA, to help with their incredible work in finding a cure for all cancers. Since you have accomplished so much, what do you hope will be your greatest legacy one day? Julie Clark made children smile.

She’d just recently survived a medical issue, and she said it rendered her completely emotional. She wondered if the same thing happened to me. “Yes!” I told her. I cried. And cried. And cried. It mostly happened at night, when my house was quiet, and my babies were sleeping, and things seemed so, well, dark and lonely. It also happened when some well-meaning person asked me, “How are you doing?” in that I-am-so-sorry-you-have-cancer tone. Instant tears. I sometimes could only choke out a brief, “I’m fine.” I wasn’t really all that fine. I had cancer, for goodness sake, and it made me very sad. Then I started taking an anti-depressant, and I went for counseling, and life got better. I took my little Zoloft pill every day for a year and a half, and I saw a therapist once a week, until all the hard treatment stuff was over, and now, I am fine. I don’t really cry over cancer anymore. Well, I do, but honestly, my tears now come from a place of happiness. When people comment on my strength, or tell me I’ve helped them in their cancer journeys, or it hits me just how far I’ve come from those bald and blah days — that’s when I cry. There are no more dark cancer days in my world, and while I realize in the back of my mind that the disease might come back, the fear really isn’t all that strong anymore. It’s there, a tiny bit, but that’s all. My bigger fear: That if I let myself sit down and put my feet up for just a moment, I won’t get everything done. Now, that’s something I need to get over.

Now, I don’t know much about Jimmy (because I don’t know much about football), but I kinda like the guy. He’s calm, focused, and he spit out some really great motivational messages for his team. Here’s the one I like best: Background: Survivor player Holly found herself struggling with the game. The mental challenge was too much, she was acting not like herself (she loaded a teammate’s shoes with sand and sunk them in the ocean because she heard him talking about her), and she was ready to head for the hills. Jimmy told her the team needed her and encouraged her to reconsider going home. Then, he asked a pivotal question: He asked her if she could do it for one more day. She stayed in the game. I think this is just perfect for those of us leaning toward giving up, quitting, or walking away from the tough stuff. Maybe it’s a grueling run with chemo, a job that seems unforgiving, or a bunch of crazy kids challenging you to the core. One more day. Surely, you can survive that.

It’s the one book I recommend to everyone I meet with a new diagnosis, it’s my go-to gift recommendation for family and friends who don’t know how to help, and it sits tattered and worn on my bookshelf, ready for instant consultation. As of yesterday, I have a brand new shiny copy of Dr. Love’s treasured book of wisdom (fifth edition) — the coveted resource she revamps every few years so that women everywhere have the latest and greatest information on a disease we so badly need to understand. How is this book different from all the others? Well, it’s been totally reorganized and rewritten in order to communicate two paradigm shifts that have taken place over the years: (1) We now know that all breast cancers are not the same. There’s actually five or six molecular subtypes, and treatment must be personalized to match each one. (2) We also know that cancer cells do not function in isolation. There’s more than a mutated cell at work — it needs an environment to nourish it. A bad cell in a good environment will likely stay dormant. But if the environment changes, there might be trouble. Aha, lifestyle is important. With these two topics woven throughout, Dr. Love breaks down everything from the biology of the breast to risk factors to decisions regarding treatment. She talks recurrence and research and politics, and she’s got sketches, drawings, charts, and graphs to help make sense of it all. The book is more than 600 pages long, and that should tell you something about how detailed and complex breast cancer can be. Don’t be intimidated, though. You don’t need to sit down and start reading — just use it for reference, and be thankful that there’s someone out there, armed with the best and most accurate information, who cares enough to try to stop this deadly disease once and for all. It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to give away one copy of Dr. Love’s book.

I mean, I would have loved the mapped route to have been 40 miles (as advertised) and not 37 miles because a few of us who trained for FORTY MILES wanted to ride FORTY MILES and were disappointed when the mileage fell short. That’s OK, we added 3 miles so we could claim a true victory. Still, the event was lovely. Wait, actually, lunch was all gobbled up when we arrived at the finish line, so that was not grand, but perhaps the Mexican grub would have still been available had we followed the rules and stopped pedaling at 37.

486,29,32,12,4,2016,2016-04-12,"Yesterday, I posted this on Facebook: In the spirit of sharing the bad along with the good (because rumor has it that Facebook tends to spotlight the perfect lives of perfect people), I want you to know that I spent much of my morning creating a spreadsheet chronicling nearly TWO AND A HALF YEARS of undiagnosed tummy troubles so I can present dates and tests and results to ANOTHER doctor tomorrow in hopes of turning up answers regarding the misery I feel in my gut. I have no idea what I should eat, I have no motivation for exercise due to discomfort, I am gaining weight, and I am nearing full-blown depression (if you talk to my mom and John, you may learn that I have already arrived). Still, I will continue trudging along this mysterious path. Someone MUST be able to help me. For now, I think it will be the person who gives me a pedicure at 1:00 p.m. (Oh, and although I can share this snippet of doom and gloom in writing, I will probably cry if you ask me about it. Just a warning.) Then, I saw a new doctor, and this is what happened: I met with a new primary doc who had the great vantage point of looking in the Shands system at ALL of my medical history. She saw every test and every result and every opinion of every doctor I have seen during the past 2.5 years, and as the doctor reviewing it all, she concluded that I have had more extensive testing than the average person with abdominal issues. There is only one test left to order, and she has ordered it—I will get a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis. If this does not turn up anything conclusive, her belief is that I have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is a disorder of exclusion, meaning that when everything else is ruled out, this is often what is left. She cannot rule out completely that chemo and radiation screwed up my insides, and if they did, well, then the damage is done, and I must live with it. IBS is managed well by some people with fiber, so I will up my intake. It is also managed by identifying and minimizing triggers; some folks are triggered by certain foods, but I have been tested out the ying-yang for food allergies, and I have none. My trigger is most likely stress (yay to all the smart people who predicted this!). When I learn to minimize stress and/or manage well the stress that confronts me, I should feel better. I will start taking (again) an antidepressant to help me cope, I will keep eating a Paleo diet of small-portioned meals and exercising regularly, and most important, I MUST clear my plate of excess. I have too much going on, and I will work on limiting my responsibilities and increasing my attempts at relaxation. (Oh, I will also give up some blood for testing to see if anything is problematic with my thyroid, vitamin D levels, etc.) I feel good about today’s appointment, and I feel super thankful for all the loving people in my life who have invested so much time and energy into supporting me through my physical and mental breakdowns. You have noooo idea how much your words have helped. Or maybe you do if you have ever been in a similar predicament and felt a wave of love wash over you. It is amazing. Today, I posted this on Facebook: A psychologist walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the “half empty or half full” question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired: “How heavy is this glass of water?” Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz. She replied, “The absolute weight doesn’t matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it’s not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I’ll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.” She continued, “The stresses and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed—incapable of doing anything.” Remember to put the glass down. My new motto: Put the glass down.",0,1,0.14986268212074666

Made of human hair, and with a soft cotton top, my underhair was made by Hip Hats With Hair.

Tina — whom I’ve come to know via a common friend — shaved her head just this week because the darn stuff was falling from her head in clumps. The wigs she’d tried were uncomfortable, and so I mailed her mine. She received it today. Tina’s not the first person who has used this hair, my friend Carmen borrowed it, too — twice. It just sits in a box on the floor of my bedroom closet, and since I plan to never need it again, I am happy to share.

I turned 41 and knew I needed to set up my mammogram — 40 went by so fast, and I had not done it yet. (I’d had a diagnostic mammogram when I was 35 due to a milk discharge, and everything was OK.) So, I went for my mammogram and got called back in for additional views. I was not scared at all, I knew a lot of times people need extra views. So, I went back in and had those views taken, then an ultrasound, and then a biopsy. The doctor said “usually masses that look like this are not benign.” That’s when I knew I was in trouble. Five days later, I was told I had breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma, two spots, maybe three. The next day, I went to a surgeon, he told me no chemo and a lumpectomy — that is if my MRI didn’t find something different. Well, the MRI showed a shotgun effect in my left breast. There was cancer “splattered” all around my left medial breast. This means a mastectomy. Fortunately, no lymph node involvement could be seen. The doctors could never feel the masses in my breast — even when the surgeon held the tissue in his hands, he could not feel a mass. I had my mastectomy on August 31, 2010, and being the master of this game, my cancer tricks us all again, and there is lymph node involvement, three out of 33 lymph nodes are positive. Great, I just got a free ticket for chemo! I had my bone and CAT scan, and thank goodness, those both are negative. I get to go in Tuesday for my port surgery. I am so scared about chemo — not the sickness, not the fatigue, but the hair loss, and I feel stupid for admitting that, but it’s what keeps me covered. My hair keeps me warm, it keeps me hidden, and now I am going to be totally open. I am also concerned that my son will have trouble with that. He has never seen me without my hair flowing down my back. But I will make it. I have to. There is no other way, because I will do anything to be able to see him grow and have children. So, chemo will start in a two to four weeks, and I will put on those boxing gloves once again because I will not let “C” win. And now, here’s where I weigh in with a few thoughts: First, the hair. I know. I know. I know. It’s almost worse (OK, it is worse) than the disease. Please don’t feel stupid, Lisa, for fearing the bald. We all worry. It’s totally normal, and completely expected! Second, thank you, Julie Clark, for writing this book, and for making it possible for Lisa to win a copy. I know it will warm her heart and help her son cope.

I know her voice was ever-present in my house during those early years with baby Joey. He was not a very happy and content boy, but Baby Mozart and Baby Bach helped infuse our crankiest days with a little joy. We liked Baby Santa’s Music Box, too, and even though Joey is now 9 years old, and his brother is 7, that Christmas DVD is still in our media cabinet. Yea, a good Spring Fall clean is in order. Julie has accomplished more than just engaging little ones, though. She has partnered with John Walsh, host of “America’s Most Wanted” to create The Safe Side (all about kid safety), and there’s also Memory Lane (for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia). And now, what might be my very favorite is her new book, “You Are the Best Medicine.” Julie (a two-time breast cancer survivor) wrote the book, Jana Christy illustrated it, and WOW, what a treasure for parents with cancer who want to explain the disease to their young kids in the most delicate and gentle manner. In her book, Julie draws parallels between navigating cancer and growing up: For a while I will have to take medicine that makes me feel bad, and this medicine will make all my hair fall out. I will look different. But I will laugh when I remember your own sweet little baby head, how round and bald it was, and how warm it was on my lips when I kissed it every day. I like Julie’s overall message — that children can help parents feel better, just like mom and dad do for them; that cancer can be a tough; that life can return to normal; that love and kindness really are the best medicine.

Check out what she has to say, then get busy taking her advice! Pay mind to your diet More and more, oncologists are realizing that a healthy diet may be one of the best protective measures you can take to prevent cancer, including breast cancer. Eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains As a general rule, the more natural the food, the better it is to eat. Fruits and vegetables have antioxidant qualities, which fight cancer. Berries are one of the most antioxidant-rich foods. Choose a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get an array of vitamins and minerals. Farmers markets sell fresh fruits and vegetables that are not laden with pesticides the way they are at grocery stores. Whole grains refer to foods with minimal processing and almost always have more fiber than refined carbohydrates. Avoid refined carbohydrates! Refined carbohydrates tend to cause much steeper surges of insulin than whole grains. Insulin has a drastic effect on the release of other hormones in the body, such as the insulin-like growth factor and possibly even estrogen. These two hormones have been strongly linked to cases of breast cancer. Be conscious of the different types of fat Not all fat is created equal. Omega-3 fatty acids may have a role in preventing breast cancer when eaten in a 1:2 ratio with omega-6 fatty acids. While getting the proper ratio may seem like a simple feat, it is not. Fast food and other commonly eaten American foods have a much higher amount of omega-6 (anything made with vegetable oil is packed with omega-6 fatty acids). Exercise, exercise, exercise! Exercise can reduce the risk of breast cancer in several ways. A study done at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle gathered that women who exercise have a 22% reduced rate of breast cancer. Lower stress levels The mind-body connection concerning illnesses has long been researched. Findings consistently support that stress causes lowered immunity and is linked to a vast quantity of ailments, including cancer. Exercise is key to stress reduction and mental health. Maintain a healthy weight While changes in diet may be the best method for weight loss, exercise is the most important part of weight maintenance. According to a study performed by the National Cancer Institute, gaining weight (especially after menopause) increases the risk of breast cancer. Avoid Certain Drugs The following drugs have been extensively linked to breast cancer: Estrogen: This refers to pharmaceutical estrogen, such as the estrogen found in birth control pills. Alcohol: Numerous studies show that more than one drink per day can increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer. The risk increases with each additional drink. Tobacco: Carcinogens in cigarettes are well-noted for their cancer causing properties. Louise Baker ranks online degrees for Zen College Life. She most recently wrote about the best colleges online.",0,1,0.22092933947772658

It all started because I wanted to lose the 10 pounds treatment had forced upon me, and because I wanted to rid my body of the toxins that had been suffocating it for a year and half. The changes (no alcohol, no sweets, no red meat, no really fatty foods, lots of fruits and veggies, lots of exercise), well, they worked. I lost 15 pounds, got in shape, scored a great resting heart rate and super cholesterol levels, and I became healthier than ever. Yes, it was tough at times to refuse the brownies and pass on birthday cake, but I became so happy in my skin that the few seconds it would take to stuff down a sweet treat just didn’t seem worth it anymore. My willpower lasted for three years. Three. Whole. Years. And then something horrible happened. Halloween 2009 arrived. And I fell down. One little bite of one little Tootsie Roll from my kids’ stash, and that was it. The sugary flood gates opened, and I just couldn’t get them closed. For nearly 10 months. If there’s something I’ve learned about my relationship with sweets over the years, it’s this: One cookie isn’t enough. One slice of pie won’t do it. One mini Halloween treat — you get the idea, right? So, what started with one indulgence back in October led to a feast in November, a baking frenzy in December, a free-for-all in January and February (I was training for a 1/2 marathon, and I became ravenous), and, well, there are no excuses for March, April, May, June, or July. I just ate the sweets I wanted, when I wanted, and while I really didn’t like that my scale had jumped 5 pounds and my middle felt uncomfortably soft, I couldn’t find the drive to get back on track. Until a few weeks ago, when the tides turned. I’m not sure how, or why, but just as hard as I fell, I got back up, and now, I seem to have my footing again. I can’t promise I’ll keep it, but for the moment, the sweets are off limits. I’m tightening up the reigns on my favorite crackers and nuts and carb-y snacks, too, and I’ve never let go of my commitment to no alcohol, no red meat, lots of fruits and veggies, and regular exercise, which means the scale is back on track, my middle is firming up, and I’m feeling a whole lot better about the skin I’m in. Finally. It’s been said that falling down is not what matters most. It’s the getting back up again that counts. I agree.

Every year, I get a package of snazzy breast cancer gear delivered right to my door, and today is great day, because my 2010 goodies just arrived — all the way from Nevada. That’s where my aunt lives, and each year at about this time, she goes to Aspen to participate in the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure extravaganza. She wears a sign announcing that she’s running for me, and after she runs her butt off in my honor, she heads home and boxes up the goods she gets, then she mails them off to me. See all that loot above? That’s the stuff — a bag, a t-shirt, a pen, a pin, a Ford Warriors in Pink scarf, and more. This year, my aunt asked me if I still wanted the packages. She wondered if maybe they are just reminders of all I’ve been through, and perhaps I don’t want to continue being reminded. I told her, without pause, that I do still want the gifts, because not only are they fun to use and share and save, they are the perfect reminder — not of what I’ve been through, but of how far I’ve come. You see, each time that box of treasures lands on my front porch, it screams out that I’ve survived for another year. And besides, there’s no avoiding reminders, no matter what anyone does or doesn’t do. I have a port scar, lumpectomy scars, radiation tattoos, a wacky chemo-induced sun/skin condition, and different hair. Yea, I don’t think there’s any real way to avoid the hints that cancer has rocked my world.

519,29,35,15,4,2016,2016-04-15,"This weekend, I cheated on Paleo. I ate some dark-chocolate-covered pomegranates (is that even technically a cheat?), a few French fries off the restaurant plates of little boys, and a sampling of graham crackers at a backyard bonfire (no marshmallows or Hershey’s chocolate, darn it—just the graham crackers). Many health advocates advise an 80/20 approach to deprivation clean eating, and some recommend allowing entire cheat days (gosh, that sounds fun!). For nearly a year, however, I have pretty much eaten 100% Paleo. Sure, I have lost balance a few times, but mostly, I have consumed lean meats, fruits, veggies, sweet potatoes, nuts (but not peanuts), eggs, almond butter, and coconut oil. My only real decadence has been homemade Paleo banana bread with dairy-free, nut-free, soy-free chocolate chips. I have been dedicated and strict because tummy troubles plagued me for a really long time, and I am convinced that my streamlined way of eating makes me feel better. Paleo banana bread (in muffin form). But I am human, and I long for treats, and, sadly, I think I can’t have them—like, ever—because after I stumbled off the wagon this weekend, I felt physically and mentally crummy. I still feel a tad bit crappy, actually. (Hey, it takes time to come off of a dark-chocolate-covered-pomegranate-French-fry-graham-cracker bender.) So now, I am practicing patience, which is so not easy for me. I am deep breathing and wishing away the rubber tire I feel wrapped around my middle. I am waiting for my pants to loosen to the point of comfort. I am sticking with my exercise routine even though I feel blah. And I am trying, trying, trying to be OK with the fact that I may never again cave to my cravings—or I will, and my body will revolt, and I will write this post all over again. Two things: 1. I do not want to feel this crummy again. 2. I do not want to write this post again. The end.",0,1,0.09784482758620691

She earned three degrees: an undergraduate degree in Health Administration and Journalism, an RN, and a MFA. She has three wonderful children, despite high risk pregnancies, and she wrote eight books and has won as many writing awards. Also, she is currently launching two babies at once: her most recent book, “Healing with Words: A Writer’s Cancer Journey” and her daughter’s wedding in the same month.

Photo: www.dianaraab.com And now, about the book: Diana’s latest book reflects her experiences battling breast cancer at age 47 and then multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer, when she was 52. The book is part practical advice (she is a nurse, after all) and part inspiration, which takes the form of poems, journal entries, and friendly thoughts. To show readers the effect of healing writing, Diana also includes blank sections and writing prompts so readers can contribute their own thoughts and writings. Diana describes her daily journal writing as “a daily vitamin-healing, detoxifying and essential for optimal health.” Great news: Diana will be stopping by to read this post today, so if you have any questions for her, please leave them in the comments, and she will respond.

And I know my friend is hating the idea of being bald, just like most of us do, but still, she is handling it with such grace. Her technique: she cut her very long hair very short in anticipation of the big fallout. I like her approach, which is so totally different than mine. I kept my very long hair around until the very last moment. I think I wanted so badly to not lose it, that I fought back by making not one single preparation. Silly me. The docs and nurses and every other breast cancer survivor I’d met told me it would happen, plus pretty much exactly when it would happen (about day 11-16 after the first chemo treatment), and still, I crossed my fingers tight and hoped like mad that I’d be the exception. And on the day of my second chemo dose (day 14), I wore a hat on my head to hold each hair in its place — it was starting to fall out in clumps, wash away in the shower, and it was pulling so hard on my head it hurt — when I should have accepted the inevitable and surrendered. I did surrender that night — cut off three ponytails, and handed the clippers to my husband and 4-year-old, who shaved while I cried — but only because I could no longer hold onto the hair I so desperately did not want to lose. My friend has accepted the inevitable, and I love that about her! How did you handle your hair loss?",0,-1,-0.01141025641025641

Sit on it, especially if there’s a nice evening breeze blowing by. Read old letters of recommendation (make sure they’re good ones!). Steal a hug from someone you love. Hold on for minutes, not seconds. Make a wish list, and don’t worry about the price of anything. Find a few quotes that move you, and write them down. Read a story about someone less fortunate than you, and count your blessings. Remember your own less-fortunate moments, and appreciate where you are now. Visualize memorable days, like the days your babies were born. Look at old photos. Look at old yearbooks. Burn a yummy candle. Consider everything that happens (good and bad) an adventure that you’ll look back on as a memory — maybe a funny one, maybe not, but a memory nonetheless. Reader Lauren says: Looking at yearbooks is always fun! I personally love taking a walk around a nearby pond or driving around aimlessly. Reader Tracey says: turn on the music loud and dance with your kids. Gosh, it’s hard to stop at just 12.

In fact, I can’t even put into clear and concise words how very thankful I am for the breast cancer treatments that have kept me alive for five years. If I even try to put my thoughts into words, I promise you tears will stream down my cheeks. I’m about to turn 40 on and WOW, I wasn’t sure I’d make it to that age, what with birthday No. 34 followed by such fear and uncertainty. Just so we’re clear: I am so. very. happy. to be alive and writing this. I’m simply amazed by what medicine has done for me. I’m amazed by what medicine is doing to me, too. Five years later, and it finds a way to make me a little bit miserable. Right now, actually, a lot miserable. I’m covered in red, itchy, drive-me-crazy bumps on my shoulders, chest, back, and areas around my armpits. It happens every year, and it’s called something like UV Recall. Years after treatment, the sun reacts with my skin and the poisonous drugs, and the remnants of radiation, and sunscreen (I’m not sure about what order this all follows or if it’s one or several of these factors), and my skin pays the ultimate price. You’d think I’d have figured it out after all this time, but I haven’t, because sometimes (like last year at the beach), nothing bad happens. I find a sunscreen for sensitive skin, lather it from head to toe, and I’m just fine, maybe even a tiny bit tan, which is a treat for a fair-skinned gal like me. Other times (like this year at the beach), I find a sunscreen for sensitive skin, and, well, the bumps begin — just a few here and there, then some more, until they’ve climbed all over my body, making me more and more wacky by the day. “Are you not so happy?” Danny asked me today. Gosh, how I’m trying to be happy, plodding along through these summer days like everything is fine. But it’s not. I’m itchy and scratchy, showers hurt my skin, clothing bothers it, too, the Florida heat (it’s been like 100 degrees here lately) agitates every inch of me, and well, no, Danny, I am not so happy. (Add head cold to the equation, and you might imagine how poorly I really feel.) The end is near, I know. The bumps will dry up and slowly disappear, and I will do what I always do — slink into the shadows at the pool, sit under an umbrella at the ocean, hide under the bimini of a boat. It’s no fun to be the mom always seeking shade and avoiding fun in the sun. I guess that’s why, year after year, I keep trying to jump waves, and find sea shells along the seashore, and splash in the pool — because I want to think cancer treatment won’t keep plaguing me. But it does, and it probably always will. And that’s just how it is. The very thing allowing me the pleasure of birthdays is torturing me, too. OK, I’m getting a grip here. This skin ordeal is short-lived. It will consume about a week of my life (couple more days to go), and then I’ll move on. Maybe I’ll even be free and clear by when I blow out 40 candles and celebrate another year of life. See, I’m grateful. Really, I am.

So, I’m going to do what no writer really ever wants to do — copy and paste. It’s the only way, though, for you to feel the emotion that powers this company. Yes, I’m cheating a little. But right after I cheat, you’ll find something I did work on myself — an interview with Deviant Jean’s Kristin Dudley. OK, here goes: Deviant Jeans began in a hospital room at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute when a genetic counselor broke the news that Kristin Kantner’s mother, Doris, tested positive for a gene no one else had. After a moment of silence, all her family in the room began laughing at the notion that within their perfect mother was a little deviance — a “deviant gene.” Kristin’s mom, a positive, independent, and fashion conscious woman, recognized during her cancer treatments that she had to compromise her style in order to be comfortable and compliant to doctor’s orders. As side effects of her treatments persisted, she found buttons, zippers and the basics of adorning regular clothing a challenge. Kristin watched her mother struggle to match practicality, comfort and fashion and decided to take action… Kristin collaborated with her entrepreneurial neighbor and friend, Jane Hoffer, and by a twist of fate, the two met Kristin Dudley, a Philadelphia based fashion designer focused specifically on designing for women’s wellness. After a year of planning, designing, and caring, Deviant Jeans™ apparel is now “MADE WITH LOVE IN PHILADELPHIA,” and available to women nationwide. And now for the fancy interview: Tell us exactly how some of your products make life easier for cancer patients. A major consideration in all of our designs is for our apparel to transition from every day to treatment days, without the need to disrobe when receiving chemotherapy or undergoing testing. The Deviant Heart Camisole is especially helpful for women undergoing breast cancer treatments. It is designed with a comfortable shelf bra, and features a contoured neckline to allow for easy port access. The straps are wide, which alleviates the shoulder of the digging and indentations that typically occur from bra and spaghetti straps. How do you determine what women need? I have been designing products and apparel for women’s wellness for the past 4 years. Throughout this time, women have approached me with requests for apparel designed to suit their changing bodies and lifestyles. I began receiving faxes with hand drawings of what they were seeking! I have met with many medical professionals as well, who also influenced my design. I address the construction issues, and then I add style! You’re not just about selling stuff — you’re charitable, too. Tell us more. When initiating Deviant Jeans, there was one thing that was clear between my partners and myself: we are here to make a difference, not a fortune. We decided to give the customers the unique opportunity to choose their preferred charity they wanted a portion of their purchase to benefit. We offer a list of different charities to choose from at our online checkout, and accept requests from those who wish to support their local support group or other charity. Name one great clothing tip for women making their way through treatment. Light layers are essential! Hospitals tend to be very cold inside, yet at the same time, you never know when a hot flash may pop up. Begin with your favorite camisole and layer with a loose fitting button down shirt or tunic. Bring an open front sweater or wrap to wear on top of that. Have fun with your middle layer — seek brilliant colors and wild prints! Think of your clothing as your armor, and fight your battle boldly! Pretty cool, stuff, isn’t it? Well, it’s going to get even cooler, because very soon, Kristin and I are going to be sponsoring a fun contest.

I’m sailing back in time today because someone I know is in an operating room right now. Her surgeon is removing both of her breasts, one containing a malignant tumor and the other marked by something precancerous, and that makes today her day of unknown. She doesn’t know what the docs will find: How big will the tumor be? Will the cancer have spread? What treatment will she face? Unknown. I asked my husband last night if he remembers my day of unknown. Of course he does, he told me, and what he recalls most vividly are the steps the surgeon took toward him in the hospital waiting area, once I was all closed up and starting to recover from my lumpectomy. When the steps stopped, the talking started, and John and my mom got some news: My tumor was 1.1 cm, it was Stage 1, it had not spread. They considered this all good news. When they told me, I did, too. What will my friend learn today when her surgeon starts to talk? No one knows, yet.

547,29,376,22,3,2017,2017-03-22,"Photo: geishaboy500, Flickr Surviving cancer is a good thing. Really, it is. I mean, look at the alternative. Still, living on and on after a cancer diagnosis comes with a little bit of a price tag. My personal bottom line: the potential for heart disease, maybe some additional cancers and increased cancer risk for some family members. No one can promise these curses will come to life, but no one says they won’t either. And that’s why I visited today with a very nice doctor at the forward-thinking Cancer Survivor Program at Shands Hospital, to learn all about what might face me, and what I can do about it all. My heart. In the past five years, I’ve had three treatments with the power to compromise cardiac function. There’s that toxic Adriamycin chemo drug (four doses, two weeks apart, over eight weeks time), and the radiation that zapped the area directly over my heart (every day for six weeks), and then Herceptin — the potential life-saver that sailed through my veins every three weeks over the course of one whole year. The good news is that I’m probably out of the woods with Herceptin, it usually does its damage during treatment or shortly thereafter. But the chemo drug and the radiation, these still have time, and usually, adverse reactions occur eight to ten years after chemotherapy. Enter the echocardiogram. I’ll have one in three years to start monitoring my ticker. And I’ll keep exercising and (mostly) eating right to keep in good shape. (Today’s resting heart rate: 50.) More cancers. Sometimes leukemia comes as a side effect of chemotherapy (ironic, isn’t it?), but I’m likely beyond the risky time frame for that one. Bladder cancer isn’t entirely out of the question, however, because one of my poisonous chemo drugs was processed through my bladder, and apparently, that’s not a great thing. Skin cancer, too. My risk is higher now. Perhaps the basal cell cancer I had removed from my left arm last year can be linked to this risk. Maybe it’s just a coincidence. I should pay attention to the left side of my body, though, says my doc, because that’s where another cancer might show up. My kids. My kiddos — both boys — are not really at risk. Of course, they can get breast cancer, it’s just not very probable. And their kids, if they have girls, are not at higher risk, either, even though their grandma (me!) had the disease. Had I tested positive for BRCA, they would have been. But I didn’t, so they aren’t. My sister’s two girls — no one knows for sure, but they probably will be fine. Same for my mom — the risk travels mostly from older to younger, not younger to older. My sister (sorry, Tracy!) is the one who gets the short end of the stick. My having had breast cancer ups her risk, which is why she gets a mammogram every year, and why she’s already had a baseline MRI. Am I scared by the cost of surviving cancer? No. I have every reason to believe none of this will ever affect me. And if it does, worrying about it now won’t do me a bit of good. If anything, I’m just happy to be alive and thrilled that I had the chance to sit with a doctor five years after I wasn’t sure I’d survive at all.",0,1,0.15480181277056276

Since it might be just the book you need for your library, here’s a little rundown of what you’ll find on its 594 pages. Life Over Cancer is all about integrative cancer treatment, and the guy who wrote the book — Dr. Keith I. Block (Director of Integrative Medical Education at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago) — has treated thousands of patients who have lived long, full lives beyond their original prognoses. Dr. Block is an expert at understanding how the mind and body work, he believes that lifestyle plays a major role in combating cancer, and he uses his wisdom to help folks meet the demands of their treatment and recovery. His book features the following: Innovative approaches to conventional treatments, such as “chronotherapy” — chemotherapy timed to patients’ unique circadian rhythms for enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity. Dietary choices that make the biochemical environment hostile to cancer growth and recurrence, and strengthen the immune system’s ability to attack remaining cancer cells. Precise supplement protocols to tame treatment side effects, relieve disease-related symptoms, and modify processes like inflammation and glycemia that can fuel cancer if left untreated. A new paradigm for exercise and stress reduction that restores your strength, reduces anxiety and depression, and supports the body’s own ability to heal. A complete program for remission maintenance — a proactive plan to make sure the cancer never returns. Ready to buy the book? Place your order here. And to dive a little deeper into what Dr. Block has to offer, take a look at the following exclusive article he is sharing with us (breast cancer people: see purple). Avoiding Refined Sugar Helps Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence By Keith I. Block, M.D., Author of Life Over Cancer: The Block Center Program for Integrative Cancer Treatment Several years ago, we saw tremendous growth in the consumption of fat-free and low-fat products. Believing we now had “healthier” versions of everything from salad dressings to our favorite desserts, these products began flying off the shelves, and formerly “forbidden” foods for those watching their diets became acceptable in their reduced fat versions. While perhaps reducing their fat intake, most consumers were unknowingly increasing their sugar intake, as refined sugar was the ingredient most often used in place of fat. The increased consumption of refined sugar can have serious health consequences, including a greater vulnerability to cancer, and possibly, even a worse outcome. Let me explain what happens when too much refined sugar and other food products are consumed. If you ingest whole foods, insulin will be secreted slowly and the body will manage this well. Insulin is needed to carry glucose into your tissues and is essential for providing much needed fuel. However, ingest a candy bar, your favorite brand of cookies, or 12 ounces of soda pop — what I like to refer to as carbonated belly wash — and the cells in your pancreas will respond with a surge of insulin. In recent years, researchers found that women with early stage breast cancer who had the highest insulin levels were twice as likely to have their tumor metastasize, and three times as likely to die of breast cancer, as women with the lowest insulin levels. For this reason, I believe any patient combating breast cancer or trying to avoid a recurrence would be wise to have their doctor routinely monitor their insulin and blood sugar levels, as well as their insulin growth factor (IGF-1). Choosing a whole foods diet and staying fit can reduce the deleterious effect that elevated sugar and insulin levels can have on both the risk of recurrence and risk of death. In addition, following a nutritional, fitness and therapeutic supplement program can help achieve or maintain improved levels. Even though all therapeutic interventions should be individualized to match the needs of each patient, I’m convinced that certain dietary recommendations are fundamental to achieving improved health. These include: Eat a diet lower in fat, and make it a better quality fat. Ideally, fat should represent no more than 18% of your daily caloric intake. “Good” fats include monounsaturated and Omega 3 fats. Examples of monounsaturated fats include olive oil, almond oil and walnut oil. Omega 3 fats include flax seed, canola, and, of course fats contained in cold water fish. Eat abundant cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, bok choy, kale and brussel sprouts — which contain plant phytochemicals that result in lower blood levels of estrogen by increasing the estrogen detoxification and dumping capacity of the liver. Eat a diet high in fiber, with plant-based sources of protein. Consuming more fiber in the form of whole grains, vegetables, fruit, legumes, and beans can reduce harmful circulating estrogen levels.",0,1,0.16468236789665364

Still, fingers crossed for non-suspicious findings.” My tune has changed a bit, because I had a 3D mammogram, and, apparently, it offers images that are way better than 2D, and had this sort of peek at my breast been available back when the lump was there, the thing may have been detected.

554,29,382,28,3,2017,2017-03-28,"The following post is a reprint from Braving Boys. I’m soft. I know this. And I’m OK with it. But it kind of goes against the grain of what John tries to teach the boys. Example: the other day, while at a lake for some fishing, Joey and Danny started whining about sunscreen. They hate it, especially the kind that sprays, because it gets in their eyes. So, we do our best to slather faces without blinding them, but as it always turns out, they are gun-shy and get all worked up about the event. John is sick of it. “You guys need to get hard,” he told them. “Here’s how I do it,” he declared, then pretty much sprayed the stuff directly into his own baby blues to prove his point. Explanation: John is a Marine, and he’s encountered some rough living. There was a period of time in boot camp when he was so hungry, he’d eat from sugar packets in the mess hall to fill the void in his gut. He hiked until his feet bled, marched until he couldn’t see straight, and for months on end, he was worn down and challenged to the core. He’s hard. He can spray sunscreen in his eyes. Getting hard is good. It’s preparation for life’s tough times. It’s why Joey should eat fish, even though he doesn’t like it — because maybe, one day, fish will be the only thing available. It’s why learning to defend yourself is key, because when you’ve got to fight for your life, you’ll be ready. I get it. It’s just not me. I don’t like sunscreen in my eyes either. Bug spray is yucky, too. I do like fish, but I don’t like Chinese food, and heaven help me if, one day, it’s the only thing available. I don’t want to camp — I like running water and cozy beds too much — and I don’t want to climb a rock wall or a mountain or jump from a plane, a cliff, or anything, really. I am hesitant to play a “real” game of football with Joey, because he weighs 90 pounds and his power is pretty amazing. I shy away from “real” games of basketball, too, because I’ve had few balls smack me right in the face, and ouch!, that really hurts. (I am up for a mean game of catch or P-I-G, however). Don’t get me wrong. I can be tough. I’ve white water rafted, parasailed, driven a jet ski, completed a few ropes courses, traveled Europe all by myself, run a 1/2 marathon, pushed two large babies from my body and fought breast cancer. Still, soft is my fall-back. This worries me, and sometimes I fear my boys will come to know me as the wimpy mom. It’s why I choose to engage in some battles. Will I ski down a snow-covered mountain when we finally take a ski vacation? No. But I am fully prepared to let the waves knock the crap out of me during our next beach trip. I’m also on board this year for a very long road trip (in one cramped mini-van), even though my better judgment says, “Don’t do it.” And this summer, I’ll take on one-too-many roller coasters with my little theme-park thrill seekers, even though these rides give me a throbbing head and wobbly knees. It’s a good thing there’s a John and a Jacki in our family. It’s like we’re the anchors supporting our family tree. John is at the top (of course, he climbed up there), I’m at the bottom (because I don’t want to climb up there), and Joey and Danny are right in between, observing the qualities that define their parents and deciding which ones to embrace. My wish is that Joey and Danny do get hard. I hope they also realize that, at times, it’s OK to be soft. Because really, I’m convinced there’s value in both.",0,1,0.045727716727716736

Mostly, everything is A-OK — so well, in fact, that I now get to see my favorite doctor once a year instead of every six months. But with the happy hooplah of surviving cancer for a good amount of time comes the fact that I need to start thinking about surviving the side effects of cancer for a good amount of time. There are certain issues that come with life after cancer. For me, it’s mostly heart stuff. Three things that might affect my heart: the chemo drug Adriamycin (I had four doses), radiation (it was delivered right on top of my heart) and Herceptin (the wonder drug I received for one year). All three of these life-savers can compromise heart function over time. “You should be so lucky to get heart disease in 20 years,” someone once told me, “because it means you will have survived cancer for 20 years.” Yea, that doesn’t make me feel so relieved. In fact, it’s apparently cause for a consultation. Someone is going to contact me soon to discuss survivorship issues, says my doc, and this person will notify my primary physician of potential concerns, too, so he can monitor me appropriately. I’m not overly concerned about this, really. I’m basically just thankful to be alive, with a heart that today is very strong. For now, that’s just enough.",0,1,0.33403508771929824

I was bald and bloated and beyond hope when a well-respected attending oncologist swung by my room with a crowd of med students and announced it could be another cancer causing my illness. Probably leukemia or lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy would determine my fate, this doc told me, just before he casually strolled away from my despair and moved onto his next patient. It wasn’t a biopsy that greeted me a few days later. It was a new doc, starting a new rotation. A second cancer wasn’t even on his radar. Rather, he was convinced my dose-dense chemo (given every two weeks instead of three) was to blame. Nothing some heavy-duty meds couldn’t fix. A few days later, I was home, healthy, and once again, hopeful. That was five years ago, and it was not the first time I was misguided by a well-meaning doctor, which brings me to this very important medical conclusion: Second opinions matter.

Just knight-in-shining-armour kinds of dreams — you know, where someone sweeps in and saves the day, or in my case, a life. Note: In stories about medieval times, knights were soldiers who rode on horses and helped women in difficult or dangerous situations. Anyway, my mind has been a bit wonky ever since my body was blasted by chemo five years ago. The whole head thing is sort of cool, really. Sometimes I think something is going to happen, and then it does. Or I wonder why I haven’t heard from someone in a long time, and then that person magically calls or sends me an e-mail. Or, I dream about something that is so telling. I’m dreaming about my doctor, you see, because I have a check-up with him on and he’s going to take my blood, check for lumps and bumps and determine if I’m still cancer-free. Big stuff. No wonder he’s hijacking my dreams. Now maybe this pseudo-psychic stuff is not chemo-connected at all, but I don’t recall things like this happening before poisonous potions spilled through my veins, so I tend to merge the two. Either that, or I can’t remember my mindful skills because chemo is wiping out my memory, one cell at a time. Whatever the case, I’m having doctor dreams, and while I can’t remember them clearly (aha, the memory theory is looking pretty strong), they are generally positive and happy dreams, and I’m taking that as an indication that so will be his news to me on Monday. He is my knight after all, and I’m counting on him to keep saving me. Speaking of doctors, mark your calendars, because March 30 is National Doctor’s Day. The red carnation is commonly used as the symbolic flower for this special day, so maybe you should deliver one to your own knight at the end of the month.",0,1,0.08338744588744587

Aqua Sphere Challenges Men and Women to Swim for a Cause VISTA, Calif. – March, 2010 – Aqua Sphere, the leader in high-end, innovative swim products, dares to see who will go the distance—men or women? As the sponsors of the Swim Challenge, Aqua Sphere, the company that promotes comfort and long-lasting performance in the water has thrown down the gauntlet in an effort to raise funds and awareness for breast and prostate cancer and in the process, determine who rules th e pool. Beginning April 1 through November 30, swimmers of all abilities can sign-up and sign on to www.swimchallenge.org each day to log their hours (not their laps) in the water. Whether they like it smooth or rough, on their backs or their stomachs – it’s not the stroke that matters but who will outlast their competition. The Swim Challenge website will track the total time, men vs. women, via a “leader meter” posted on the website and created as a widget so that competitors can keep tabs on their counterparts. The site will also allow swimmers to individually track their personal progress in the pool, encouraging them to swim longer each day. A $35,000 donation will be split between the Prostate Cancer Foundation (men) and The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (women); allocations will be determined by the cumulative hours swum by each gender. “Regardless who wins, they both win,” says Olivier Laguette, Director of Marketing for Aqua Sphere. “We’ve all been personally affected by cancer in some way or another but instead of simply writing a check, we wanted to do something fun that would promote a healthy lifestyle as well as some healthy competition – and a little bit of gender wars seemed appropriate.” Aqua Sphere, the originator of the “swim mask,” is widely known for their line of comfortable aquatic eyewear includin g the popular Seal and Vista masks and the Kaiman and Kayenne goggles. Designed for form and function, swimmers can simply fit the frames to their face and forget about them while they enjoy swimming for time, distance, exercise or just fun.

Ouch. This really, really, really hurts. I should have guessed it would. My sensitive and way-reactive skin has a history—the Tegaderm tape used to bandage my breast and underarm post-lumpectomy melted into my skin, the latex Band-Aid that covered my basal cell skin cancer surgery site burned a border around the wound, and sunscreen pretty much always causes me major irritation. My skin responds violently to everything, like yesterday’s aminolevulinic acid topical solution. The stuff was applied to my entire face, I sat for 45 minutes while it absorbed, and I spent 15 minutes under tanning-bed-like lights, which activated the whole process of killing pre-cancer. It’s a process for which I am thankful—this approach should wipe out all invaders at one time and prevent the repeated freezing of spots that creep up over time. But man, this is no fun, and the discomfort of my throbbing, stinging face is forcing a homebound day of rest.

I had just completed my fourth dose of chemotherapy, and the cumulative effect of 2 months worth of toxic drugs was wiping out my 34-year-old immune system. I could barely walk or talk, and I am not really sure how my mom shuffled me that day into the car, into the oncology clinic for a blood draw, and into the office of my genetic counselor, who tried to interview me about family history while I struggled to not pass out and while the lab folks examined my blood counts. My white blood cell count was low. It should have fallen somewhere between 4,000 and 10,000, but it was 700, and that earned me a mask and a swift trip to the hospital, where I was admitted and treated for 5 days. My mom sat with me during the mornings and afternoons, then she relieved my husband from kid care so he could hang with me at night. She did the whole rotation again a few weeks later, when my system crashed for a second and final time. My mom did a whole lot more than hospital duty during my battle with cancer. She raced to my house the day my doctor called me at home to say, “Unfortunately, cancer cells were found.” She held my hand before a surgeon removed the lump I had found while washing in the shower, was by my side the moment I opened my eyes post-surgery, and nursed me back from a violent skin reaction to the tape that bandaged my parts. My mom joined me for every chemotherapy infusion, watched my little boys for 35 days so I could report for radiation treatments, told me I was beautiful when I hated my bald head and bloated body, and while I know she must have quietly cried about my predicament, she was nothing but a positive force during my journey with a deadly disease I have now survived for 8 years. My mom, whose house is just a few miles away from mine (lucky me!), is a survivor herself. As a young, divorced, working woman, she raised two daughters on a shoestring budget and without child support. Times were tough, but my sister and I have nothing but cheerful childhood memories, and I am pretty sure our mom’s grit is what has helped us conquer challenging life circumstances.

My mom is also a superstar grandmother to her four grandkids, and 2 years ago, my then-fourth-grader wrote an essay titled, “My Nana Rocks.” She is “strong like a lion,” Joey wrote. “Once, I jogged down to her house, and she was relaxing outside in her favorite Gator chair. When I stepped onto her driveway, I challenged her to do 20 push-ups.

So many people have or had it so much worse than I did. Not that any cancer story should be eventful, but mine was very uneventful in my mind. Something felt unusual, I had a couple of tests done, a week later, I had it removed, and I went through some light radiation to better my odds of it not coming back. That’s pretty much how it went. I feel like calling myself a survivor is going overboard, compared to what others have gone through.” I totally get what he’s saying, and I think we all judge where we fall on the survivor spectrum. My journey was a challenge for me personally, but others have it worse, and some people must live on treatment in order to just buy time.

The bottom line, though, is that we all long to be cured, and I believe my friend should be so completely thrilled that his cancer was caught and terminated.

I referenced in my previous post an ongoing investigation of recurrent UTIs, and today, the investigation is complete. After a kidney and bladder ultrasound and a CT scan that imaged from the bottom of my lungs to my pelvic area, I now know that I have, according to my urologist, “two good-sized stones.” The ureter (see arrow on the diagram to the right) holds these kidney stones, which are 5mm and 6mm in size. The ureter is just about 5mm in width—essentially, the little buggers are not coming out on their own, and all of the discomfort I have felt since November was not UTI pain but complications of kidney stones trapped in a tiny tube. My stones are down low, which explains the cramping, aching, and pressure that feels like a combo of menstrual cramps and contractions.

She didn’t know it would happen that way, and I didn’t know it would happen that way, but our two presentations meshed beautifully. For example, she talked about how it’s not uncommon for cancer survivors to get skin cancer, and when it was my turn to talk, I pointed to the ugly scar on my arm where my basal cell cancer was removed. She discussed the value of psychotherapy and antidepressants during cancer treatment, and I revealed that both were part of my line-up. She discussed chemo brain. I think I had that.

My OB/GYN ordered the test on after he removed my copper IUD (my only option for quality, non-hormonal, post-breast-cancer birth control) just in case the foreign object, which has been in place for 8 years, is causing my woes. I guess he’ll be looking via sonogram for fibroid tumors, ovarian cysts, something that looks just not right.

He does like to read with me, though, and, so, I have made it my mission to help him get lost in the written word. Today, we read aloud on the front porch (John secretly snapped this pic) from our own copies of the same book, and this is how it went: Danny read one chapter, I read three chapters (they are short), Danny read another chapter, I read two more, and so on. This back and forth is what keeps him engaged, and the joy for me is that I get to listen to my 9-year-old boy read aloud, which is magical; I love how he uses his voice to narrate the pages, how he reacts to suspense, how he asks me questions to clarify what’s happening. The book we’re currently reading — The Tiger Rising — is filled with powerful messages that are such super teaching topics, and I am thankful for the dedicated time with Danny to discuss what author Kate DiCamillo covers in her gripping paperback; there is bullying, sorrow, anger, friendship, loss, even cancer. It was Danny’s turn to read when the word cancer appeared in Chapter 16. “How did your mother die?” she asked suddenly. Rob sighed. He knew there was no point in trying not to answer. “Cancer,” he said. Danny shot a look my way, and our eyes locked. Cancer. The word always inspires a reaction in our family.

594,29,6,17,3,2016,2016-03-17,"“You know what is amazing?” 12-year-old Danny asked me last week on the way home from his bus-stop pick-up. “What?” I replied. “The human body,” he responded. I suspect that his revelation stems from a recent science lesson about chromosomes and genetic disorders and a report he wrote about hemophilia. He went on to share how unbelievable it is that HUMANS CAN CREATE OTHER HUMANS. I agreed with him and added my two cents: It is also amazing how often the human body plugs along despite the potential for breakdowns. The body is a machine, much like an automobile, and the possibility of glitches, accidents, crashes, and burns is ever present. We are wise to keep our bodies running with nutritious fuel, purposeful activity, smart maneuvers, maintenance, and tune-ups. Still, wrong turns can occur. Danny easily transitioned from our brief chat; bodies are now completely off his radar, replaced with gaming and binge watching with his dad (for the second time) episodes of “Lost.” My radar, however, is still hovering on the topic. Bodies—mine specifically—have been on my mind since the day I realized that my femaleness in this world generated attention. For me, it started in first grade with glasses that I hid in my bedroom closet (sorry, mom) because I felt embarrassed to show up at school looking different. Then came boobs—BIG BOOBS—that made me a body-conscious girl and a frequent buyer of large, oversized shirts. I had some acne. I had braces. Weight crept into the mix at some point, and although I have never been overweight or underweight by number alone, I have obsessed at times about looking better. Until this year. This year, I turned 45, and I feel confident, secure, and happy with my human body and all of its imperfections and simultaneous awesomeness. I believe that my age delivered me to my current contentedness, but the list Danny inspired me to write about everything my body has encountered—the glitches, accidents, crashes, and burns—cemented my peace of mind. I asked Danny to work his magic on my words and turn them into a sparkly poem. (He recently did some killer work in language arts.) He declined.

(Note to Joey: I do hope you did not inherit my test-taking mediocrity, and if you did, then may I suggest you become good friends with extra credit.) It took some pretty savvy study smarts from the dad in the family to help Joey spit out the goods on civilization and culture, early humans, Ancient Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Israelites, and Ancient Greece. I did come in handy for one bit of content, though, and I hope that when Joey was faced yesterday with paper and pencil and bunches of multiple choice questions that my 60 days of eating like a caveman triggered everything he needed to know about the Paleolithic people. What Joey needed to know is that the Paleo folks were hunters and gatherers; they ate only what they could, well, hunt or gather. There was just one real mission during those long-ago days — to search for the next meal in the spirit of survival. Then came the Neolithic Age, characterized by the shift to farming, which made life much easier. Food was more of a sure thing; survival was not so elusive. Ever heard of the Agricultural Revolution? This was it. Farming changed they way people lived. (Joey needed to know this, too.) Then, a whole bunch of years passed by, and here we are today, in a society that dishes out over-sized plates of fried, fatty, processed foods to a population of overweight and unhealthy adults and childen who just might benefit from heading back to simpler times. Or would they? U.S. News Health, in consultation with a panel of diet and nutrition experts, scrutinized 29 different diets, my own Paleo plan included. The pros ranked each diet according to how easy it is to follow, its ability to produce short-term and long-term weight loss, its nutritional completeness, its safety, and its potential for preventing and managing diabetes and heart disease. The goal was to identify the best approaches to eating, and Weight Watchers, the Biggest Loser diet, the TLC diet, and the DASH diet all came out on top across several categories. The diet gurus gave Paleo a few compliments — it’s low in sodium and high in protein, for example — but overall, Paleo didn’t make the cut. Noted flaws were (a) weight loss is not a sure thing, and one small study showed a maybe loss of about 5 pounds over 3 weeks; (b) heart benefits are unknown, and it’s not clear whether Paleo can prevent diabetes; (c) shunning grains and dairy can minimize nutrient intake; (d) the diet can be pricey; and (e) it’s just plain hard to follow due to the total ditching of major food groups. In a nutshell (nuts are Paleo-approved, by the way, but not peanuts because they are not actually nuts), I am not swayed by this diet round-up. I’m sticking with my primal ways because I feel better overall eating only lean meats, veggies, fruits, nuts, and seeds (oh, and eggs, too). I have lost roughly 7 pounds in 2 months (that was not my goal, just a perk), I’m taking a few supplements, I’m not spending too much, I love that my body is clean and free of junk, and I personally don’t find the plan too hard to follow. Granted, I have medical reasons — tummy troubles and the endless pursuit of cancer prevention — to embrace the strictness, and I am the first to admit that this could be a rough road for someone pursuing Paleo just for the fun of it. For me, though, it’s a fit. Simpler times seem to suit me just fine, and I am confident I am healthier due to my hunter-gatherer food choices. Have you tried any of these 29 diets?

He’s the one who called me at home the day before Thanksgiving 2004 to inform me that “unfortunately, cancer cells were found.” His note read: Dear Jacki, Just a brief note to let you know that I regret being the messenger of bad news, but know that you will come through this difficult time healthy & strong.

Imperfect handwriting was not OK, coloring outside the lines was not good enough, and if my ponytails and braids were lopsided, I was inconsolable. Perfection is what I sought. Always. Danny is nothing like me—when he showed me how he accidentally smeared the marker drawing on the cover of his fourth-grade writer’s journal, he said, “I’m just pretending that it’s water dripping down the front.” What a healthy response to a minor error. What did I see when I spotted the goof, which was topped with bubbled-up sticky laminating wrap? I saw imperfection. I wanted to re-do that project. And fast. But I didn’t. It wasn’t my problem to fix. It wasn’t a problem at all, in fact. Perfectionism is not all bad. I suspect it’s the character trait that allows me to stick with exercise routines, clean diets, organized schedules, and healthy routines. It’s not all good, either, though, and honestly, I know deep down that it’s mostly detrimental to my well-being. I’ve long been aware of this, and through cancer-related therapy and anti-depressant treatment, I achieved some success curbing my pursuit of all-the-time greatness. Then I became an editor. What was I thinking? Writer and editor Laura Hale Brockway says, “As an editor, the kick in the head is that no matter how hard I try—proofreading backward and forward, fact checking, checking sources, etc.—simple, preventable errors still occur.” I know. I know. And it’s killing me. I chose a career I love—one that kinda, sorta, pretty much requires perfection. Clients hire me to fix what they’ve missed. If I don’t catch their flubs, then I’m not really doing my job. Or so goes the story in my head. What I must learn is that I am doing my job. And I’m good at it. I’ve been told by those who pay me to proofread that I’ve exceeded their expectations, I’ve helped them score good grades, I’ve taught them so much about the written word. Still, that missing comma or extra quotation mark, discovered long after I’ve delivered a project back to its owner, haunts me. Perfect is an impossible goal. I am human, and humans make mistakes; therefore, I am set up to fail with every task I tackle. Sure, there may be times when I achieve 100%, but can I keep up that gig for all of time? Not a chance. Brockway cites Joseph T. Hallinan, author of the book “Why We Make Mistakes,” who reports that humans have design flaws that set us up for mistakes. We are efficient, but also error prone. We are just wired that way, and the sooner I get over my hang-ups about getting everything right all the time, the smoother I will sail through life. Am I capable of such an undertaking? I’m really not sure. According to the experts at the University Of Illinois At Urbana-Champaign’s Counseling Center, I should experiment with my standards for success. “Choose any activity and instead of aiming for 100 percent, try for 90 percent, 80 percent, or even 60 percent success,” they say. “This will help you to realize that the world does not end when you are not perfect.” Yea, I realize the world will not come to a screeching halt just because I stumble when I intend to soar. My concern is that maybe editing is not what I should be doing in this world. The pressure to perform at such a high standard is just so consuming. I don’t intend to make any big career moves at this very moment. I’m just soul searching, trying to find peace in my body so that I can enjoy more happy and less haunt. And you do know that I’ve proofed this story about a zillion times in hopes of catching all of my blunders, right? Did I leave some behind? I’m sure I did. But I’m moving on.

I have narrowed down my suspicions, though, and I keep coming back to the worry that something I’m eating is screwing up my insides. That’s why I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands and heal my body one bite at a time. For almost one week, I have eaten a Paleolithic (Paleo) diet — basically, I am mimicking the eating habits of our long-ago ancestors who ate only what they could hunt and gather. My diet, therefore, consists of animal protein (but no red meat for me), vegetables, fruits, and naturally-occurring, high-quality fats (like some, but not all, nuts). The purpose of eating primal is to decrease inflammation inside the body and to achieve a higher level of physical and mental health. Buying grass-fed meats and organic foods is the best way to accomplish this way of life, and while I am not totally there just yet, I’m doing my very best to follow the rules. The proof is in my gas bill — I have trekked to grocery stores and markets every day this week chasing down products that fit the bill — and in the new items that now line the shelves of my fridge and pantry. Paleo Bread is today’s score. The bread I am accustomed to eating is not on the Paleo list. But this way-expensive, gluten-free, grain-free, yeast-free, dairy-free, soy-free, starch-free option, made by Julian Bakery and available at my local D’lites Emporium, is approved. It’s made with coconut (there’s an almond option, too) and is low in calories, low in carbs, high in protein, and high in fiber. It’s also not quite as tasty as real bread — the kind I once slathered with honey butter at the Outback and dipped in oils at Macaroni Grill. I did yummy up my new purchase with a bit of almond butter and sliced red grapes, and I think I’ll be fine with this mini treat, even though the bread slices are really small and really thin, and they don’t toast very well. I am not sure whether I’ll be a loyal fan of this bread. (To its credit, it is very filling.) Honestly, I’m not certain where this Paleo journey will lead me.

Last November, I nearly lost my mind after a bogus MRI revealed a possible malignancy. Yesterday, I learned that I pretty much have a zero chance of breast cancer recurrence. My doctor says she knows this because of my type of disease — my tumor was ER/PR negative and HER2 positive, which happens to be aggressive, but only for the first 5 years. After 5 years (I’m at almost 8 years), there’s pretty much no risk of recurrence either locally or to distant organs. That’s not to say another cancer won’t ever pop up, but the one I had should not ever, ever, ever return. I will not, therefore, be a woman who says 20 years down the road that her cancer came back. I should find great peace and comfort in this news, said my doctor. I do, I assured her. I really, really, really do, and while I kept my composure in her office as this gift of information swirled in my brain, tears fill eyes as I adjust to my newfound relief. More good news — no more annual MRI. It’s not the standard of care for someone with my risk, and that makes it just not necessary. No more annual blood draw, either. It’s also not the standard of care, and the results tell my doctor nothing about my cancer-related health. My future line-up, then, is one annual follow-up with this doctor (she’s my medical oncologist), one annual follow-up with my radiation oncologist, and one annual mammogram. Sounds good to me.

He uses it to excuse his questionable behavior — like when he was playing at the dinner table recently, waving his arms all around like we tell him not to do, and he knocked over his cup of milk. “It could be worse,” he announced after locking eyes with my frustrated gaze. Not exactly my preferred response — “I’m sorry, mom, I know I shouldn’t have been horsing around, and it won’t happen again” would have been my pick—but hey, the kid is 7. How much can I expect, really? Besides, he’s right. It could be worse. Sometimes Joey is wise beyond his years. The kid always gives me something to think about. Once Joey told his dad about the grandfather he never knew (he died before Joey was even born): “Don’t worry that your dad can’t see you anymore. He’s in the sky now and the clouds are his eyes.” He told me 3 years ago that cancer is “medicine and love.” Pretty good way to sum it up — I got lots of medicine and lots of love. I’m not sure in hindsight that I’d describe it much differently. It could be worse. I keep thinking about this and realizing Joey is right on with this perspective. Back to cancer. I found a lump — early. It could have been worse. It could have spread. It could have been larger. I had a lumpectomy. It could have been worse. I could have had a mastectomy. I had chemo, and it made me sick. It could have been worse. My cancer could have been so bad chemo wouldn’t have worked. I was hospitalized twice during treatment. It could have been worse. I could have been hospitalized three, four, five times. I had radiation, and my skin burned slightly. It could have been worse. My skin could have been left sizzled and scorched. I could have been in pain. I wasn’t. I had more drug therapy. It could have been worse. I could have been a non-candidate for the treatment (Herceptin), which could be the very thing saving my life. I went to counseling for more than 1 year and took an anti-depressant, too. It could have been worse. I could have denied these forms of help and could be battling depression and anxiety at this very moment. I’m not. I’m happy. I could go on and on, but I think you get my drift.

Taking someone with you who can jot down pertinent information, while remaining a shoulder for you to lean on, will be extremely helpful.

At the time, I was in the midst of breast cancer treatment. On my mom and I attended a half-day seminar on the topic of breast cancer. It was sponsored by Shands Hospital, and many of the speakers were my own medical people — a surgeon who took my blood prior to my lumpectomy for research purposes, an oncologist who treated me both times I was hospitalized during my first chemo regimen, my physical therapist, and the woman who coordinated my initial care when I was first diagnosed. I already knew a lot about what they talked about, but I learned that there is a lot on the horizon for breast cancer detection and treatment — like new radiation techniques that can limit the treatment time from seven weeks to just one week and methods for detecting the smallest trace of breast cancer before it begins to grow. My physical therapist is studying cancer-related fatigue (I think I have it!) and how to manage it. It amazes me that these medical professionals are spending their work days seeking cures and miracles. What a huge responsibility. What a noble cause. I am lucky to be in their care. But after hearing about all the science and hope and possibilities, I am reminded mostly of one loud and clear message I heard on this day. The oncologist spoke about the components of breast cancer tumors — there are about six criteria that are taken into consideration when studying a tumor, such as age, stage, grade, lymph node status, hormone receptivity, and HER-2 status. My criteria are: age 34 at diagnosis, stage 1 (out of 4), grade 2 (out of 3), lymph node negative, ER/PR negative, and HER-2 positive. Some of this is good; some not so good — this balance has left me feeling OK about my personal situation. But the oncologist said, “even a good tumor in a young women is a bad tumor.” I guess I knew this. My age is what qualified me for aggressive treatment — because young women have the most aggressive tumors. But to hear it spoken in a formal teaching setting and in somewhat of a grim tone, is troubling. But I’m OK. I’m not wounded by this bit of information, and I’m not anxious like I once would be. I still feel like I am winning my battle, so I can take this in stride. And if cancer comes back to me one day, I’ll just keep fighting — like this young woman who is quoted in the book “Hope Lives: The After Breast Cancer Treatment Survival Handbook“: Why do I keep going through treatment when there is no permanent cure? I ask myself this every time. There are no options other than death, which to me is no option. It’s not that I fear death. I really don’t anymore. I just love life too much to quit. It’s a race against time. Treatment buys me time until they come up with new drugs or new ways to treat this illness.

I mean, he spends his days and nights (when not wrangling three little kids) trying to cure a horrible disease — I am totally in awe of that. I am also in awe of the researchers who recently discovered that there are four molecular subgroups of breast cancer, each group with its own biology and survival outlooks, which has resulted in a new and unprecedented peek into breast cancer. The study of samples from 825 breast cancer patients has led to the identification of the following subtypes of breast cancer: HER2-enriched (HER2E), Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB), and Basal-like. The implications of uncovering these groups are huge — it has been determined, for example, that the Basal-like group (also known as triple negative breast cancer) shares genomic similarities with serous ovarian cancer; now, researchers can compare treatments across these two cancers. Also, it seems that half of HER2-positive cancers belong to the HER2E subtype; the other half belong to Luminal subtypes — now we know that there are at least two types of HER2-positive tumors; as a HER2-positive girl, I wonder which group is mine and what meaning this has for my survival.

A nice spring Saturday is the perfect day to contemplate the garden and take care of other things around the house. We started by cleaning out the garage of gardening items and moving them under the porch. I pointed, my husband picked things up and put them down. He then set up the hammock stand so I had to try it out for a bit. (Very comfortable. I will make good use of it this summer.) I then went into the garden and cleaned out some invasive weeds (I swear the previous owners considered dandelions to be good plants). Then I pruned away at the dead branches on the bushes and the ones which were broken in the heavy snow this winter. So far so good. I probably spent an hour in the garden. Later I set up my loom and warped it (put the longer strands of yarn on it) so I could begin weaving. I was about to start weaving when I realized that my back hurt a lot and was starting to spasm. At that point, I decided I was done for the day and my husband cooked dinner while I lay in bed. I thought I was okay with a pain pill and went to bed. I did not sleep well (second night in a row) and my back is still pretty sore. I am waiting for my next pain pill to kick in. But I was only trying to be normal and do normal things. And today is not going to be a good day. Too bad I have plans for lunch out and then a museum. I will start with lunch and see how well I actually do. I probably will have to nix the museum as I am not sure how I will do standing so much. Grrrr.... I just wanted to have a normal day. Is that too much to ask?",0,1,0.09922222222222221

It is not my problem if some people are acting pretty stupid around me, or are rude, or are just plain dumb. I do not feel the need to put up with it. I have enough going on in my life that I can be a bit cranky when dealing with others. As a friend was telling me recently, I need to keep my mouth shut and not tell people they are driving me crazy. I know its not my business what someone else wants to do but sometimes I can be a bit 'outspoken' (as I hear peals of laughter in my head from the people who know me best). I recognize that I do think I can come across as a bit bitchy at times. I do try to be a nice person but sometimes I just can't keep my mouth shut. Especially if someone is really pushing my buttons, then I get really cranky. Here's an example: a group of friends are trying to get together for lunch and a museum. Around here, many public libraries have discount museum passes available on a first come/first served basis. I don't mind getting the museum passes, because I am cheap and it saves me money. But one friend (and I am not making this up) called me, texted me, called my library, and texted me again in a five minute period to let me know that my library has the pass available for the day we want them, they were available, and could I reserve it. I didn't require babysitting and I sent her a text back to tell her that. That all got under my skin for some reason. Why did she need to do so much? All I needed was to be asked to see if I could get the museum pass. Am I over-reacting? I don't think so. It made me feel that she thought I was incapable of checking on the availability of the pass and reserving it. Of course my inner child made me wait several days to actually reserve the pass to make her sweat if she decided to micromanage me and check again at the library. I don't need micromanaging. I am quite capable of taking care of things myself. Allow me to feel a bit intolerant for a bit here.",0,1,0.06980042016806724

Before a cancer diagnosis, cancer probably occupies a little tiny corner of your brain. After a cancer diagnosis, it takes up all but the little tiny corner of your brain required to do basic things like eat and sleep at minimal levels. After the initial stress, cancer-brain occupation slowly settles down to a somewhat manageable level as basic human demands for survival kick in - like thinking semi-logically. Eventually you get to a bit more of an even keel so you get through life, after therapy, support groups, or whatever. Then life goes on, if cancer doesn't return, and you get some more of your brain capacity back and begin to think about life around you again. So now, I wonder if I am thinking too little about cancer? Because I do not allow it to fill my brain all the time. Should I allow myself to think about cancer more? Now that I have this knitting group with other women with cancer at the cancer support center, I feel like I am back in a support group sometimes. We have conversations about the ups and downs of diagnosis and treatment along with all sorts of related issues. I kind of like that part. But it makes me wonder if I should be thinking (pondering) cancer more? I like being sort of back to my regular life without the cancer domination.

(Those were the evil cells.) Now there is a new theory, that a group of cancer cells located together then grow into a tumor (known as a metastasis which none of us want). I can relate to this new theory. A single cell isn't a bad guy. Its when the rest of them are bad, they have nothing to do but hang out together and spread their evilness around your body. Like hanging out in a bad neighborhood. I had never really thought about what the environment of a tumor cell would have to do with the growth of cancer until I had Dr Susan Love talk back about five or so years ago. She had discussed that new research then was interested in the neighborhood a bad cancer cell was in, not just the cell itself. This new research seems to show that train of thinking has been subject to research and now is showing more answers. So now I must have a stern talking to with any cancer cells that may be hanging out in my body and tell them to stay away from each other.

Maybe you might feel ""tired afterwards"" or ""possibly nauseous"", or ""a little pain"" at the site that can be handled by ""OTC acetaminophen or ibuprofen"". But you really need prescription morphine for the pain, cant get out of bed for three days because of fatigue, or spend days running for the bathroom.

Face it most of our medical professionals have never experienced the procedures they perform on patients. Sure they have had blood tests, injections, and more, but have they had your chemo protocol, surgery, or invasive procedure? Probably not. Hence there is no way for them to tell you how you will feel before, during, and after, other than scared sh**less, because they really do not know. I hate this. I have learned to research all medical procedures before I have them. I also look to friends and others who might have experienced it to find out what its like from the patient's perspective.

I say 'mostly' because who can say they are continually positive all the time. After a quarter century of a cancer focus in my life when went from all encompassing to moving to the back of my brain, things changed. Nearly nine years ago, that all changed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Cancer came front and center in my life. Actually it came roaring back into the front and center of my life. One thing else I did know at the time was that I had already gotten through cancer once before so I could be slightly optimistic that I could do it again. A tiny sliver of positive things.

Now I have a split focus in my life, sort of evenly divided between: breast cancer thyroid cancer rheumatoid arthritis fibromyalgia all the related side effects from all the related treatments What this means is that cancer is not completely a giant sucking black hole in my life.

Apparently back in 2010 some people decided they were tired of scientists setting the research agenda time line so they decided to create their own deadline. How illogical... how over simplified. Through my blog reading, I read the latest updates from other bloggers. One of them, Jennie, went to the recent Deadline 2020 people's meeting, which the metastatic breast cancer community calls, Deadby2020, at a high end resort in Napa Valley.

(Read Jennie's blog post to get all the details.) Perhaps there should be an investigation into misuse of funds here as well. One problem is the Deadby2020 people ignore metastatic breast cancer and only focus on prevention, and women, and white women only (if their meeting is anything to go by). This leaves more than 40,000 people dying each year from the disease. And Jennie acted in the normal fashion of the metastatic breast cancer community and started live tweeting from the meeting. And was cornered and told to stop. This was after she was cornered and told to stop bringing up metastatic breast cancer. I can't believe how rude they were to her. How selective they were to her. How unconcerned they were about her feelings and sensitivities. I have run many events myself and can understand how one person with questions can appear to alter the focus of a meeting. But if they are too narrowly focused they are not benefiting anyone. It would have been better if they had stopped their agenda and added a session on metastatic breast cancer and what can be done about it. Also the concept of holding such an event which does not accurately represent the people they are trying to help while excessively spending (rooms start at $540/night), in my opinion, is basically unethical and irresponsible.What were they thinking?

As I have said before, the whole new normal thing is bogus and not worth seeking because it doesn't exist. And its not after a year either. That year concept is wrong. First of all, your treatment may not end in a year. You are forever changed and even if your body returns to something resembling your previous body, your mind has been irreparably scarred.

That is fine, actually pretty cool. Its actually nice to bond with people who are coping or have coped with the surgeries, chemo, radiation and all that other 'fun' stuff. But then, if someone you know knows someone else who was diagnosed with cancer, do you feel like they rush to tell you about it? Or are they asking questions of you to help their friend? Or are you just being hypersensitive? I remember when I was in college a couple of years after my thyroid cancer diagnosis, a guy I knew was diagnosed with cancer. He was brought to a party by a mutual friend who brought him over to me so we could talk. He had a late stage brain cancer, only lived a few months longer, and was in a wheelchair. It was actually great to get to know him better but a very sad conversation. Afterwards I started thinking (which I should never do, I know) and almost felt like I was expected to talk to him because we both had cancer so therefore we must know each other and be friends.

Since my breast cancer diagnosis, I have been more open about my medical history and talk to people all over all the time about cancer and other medical issues. I am happy to talking as many people who want to talk to me about medical crap (all cancer is crap).

In my dream, I felt very stressed about my old friend (who was a melange of a bunch of old friends) being so sick and running out of options when I was hospitalized only for a minor issue and went home the next day. (And who goes out for dinner before surgery?) When I woke up I felt I had been very put upon my by high school friend and her husband because I had cancer I was supposed to be the 'caretaker' of the sick friend. Then I started thinking about it (I promise I will try to stop thinking as much): - am I the good sympathetic resident of cancerland; or, - am I becoming oversensitive to the 'friend of a friend of a friend who was just diagnosed with cancer'; or, - am I becoming a cynic about all medical crap?",0,1,0.056661904761904774

There are some who are concerned about it in that opposing factions are demanding this access into research so they can come up with ways to block or slow it. The Union of Concerned Scientists is even concerned about interference into the ""deliberate nature of science research"". Scientists learn about something new and have to digest and discuss it and research it further without interference to learn its impact. ""These scientists, the group says, are increasingly being harassed by ideological foes who seek to unearth documents that would derail or sully their work with evidence of bias."" My concerns have long been based in the media who seem to insist on hyping tiny developments in research, particularly cancer research, to be the biggest breakthrough since sliced bread. While I appreciate First Amendment rights for freedom of information and I do not think that anything but the truth should be published. I think we need to learn the whole story when the research is completed before being subjected to media hype. If a clinical trial was based on FOUR people, as I blogged about last year, it is NOT newsworthy. Or if its a preliminary breakthrough which was not the goal of the study, why are you telling us this? And if you are only looking for a reason to derail someone else's work, why don't you wait until they are done (unless you truly have a scientific reason, not a personal agenda) to tell us about it. Research takes time and is not going to be ready for the evening news, until it is complete. This holds true for all types of research. Time is a requirement of research. And even with the internet and open access an expectation, we need to allow the research to be completed before airing it. This also is the case for clinical trials and FDA approvals.

""An international panel of pathologists and clinicians has reclassified a type of thyroid cancer to reflect that it is noninvasive and has a low risk for recurrence. The panel renamed encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)."" So you used to have cancer but now you don't any more. This isn't a cure in any way, shape, or form. Its a bit of fancy word play if you ask me. And its a way to prevent overdiagnosis. (Isn't that smart.) Its sort of like sending a rocket to Pluto and then deciding not to after it was already on its way. For me its a bit of a different story. Back at my thyroid cancer diagnosis, I was told I had both follicular and papillary. I don't think they had any way of diagnosing subtypes then so I have no way of knowing if the follicular thyroid cancer I had was this non-cancer type or not. This is not helpful to me at all. ""Dr Nikiforov and colleagues point out that the incidence of EFVPTC has risen two- to threefold during the past 20 to 30 years and makes up 10% to 20% of all thyroid tumors diagnosed in Europe and North America. This increased incidence has been explained by improvements in diagnosis. It has been described as an ""epidemic of diagnosis"" rather than a true increase in disease."" This is part of the movement to decrease over diagnosis and over treatment. Okay, I can understand the over treatment part but not the over diagnosis part. ""In 2013, a working group sanctioned by the National Cancer Institute proposed that a number of premalignant conditions, including ductal carcinoma in situ and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, should no longer be called ""cancer."" Instead, the conditions should be labeled something more appropriate, such as indolent lesions of epithelial origin (IDLE), the working group suggested. ""Use of the term 'cancer' should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated,"" the group said at the time."" Over diagnosis is a problem that I can agree with. However if its an ailment that requires treatment it should be treated appropriately. I also can agree if people are told what they have is not cancer, it may be significantly less stressful for the patient and their family. But if it is something that could turn in to cancer and kill you in the long run, the word cancer should not be removed from the name. And if you can't tell which it is, just assume the worst and treat accordingly.",0,1,0.09986772486772488

I had one of those around and around and around arguments discussions yesterday with someone (not my husband) yesterday. He kept saying that what he does to make himself feel better will work for everyone else, especially for the person we were talking about. I chose to disagree and we ended up arguing discussing it way too long. My point was that with rheumatoid you may be able to go do something for a bit and then you need to take a break and rest for a while before doing something else. And sometimes that rest period could be a few hours before you were up to anything else. His point was that if you were sitting for a few hours, reading or whatever, you need to get up every hour and do some exercises. And you need to go for a walk or two every day and you should never just sit around. I tried to explain that with lots of pain or different types of pain, rest may need to take priority and getting up and doing exercises every hour may not be a reality. I agree that sitting around all the time is not a good idea but sometimes when the pain is too bad, that may be all you can do. He would not let go. He insisted he was right because it works for him and that he has pain too (but not rheumatoid) and he is just stubborn as hell. He assumed because he has pain too what works for him works for everyone else with pain. I ended up being very upset and made some excuse to get off the phone. He assumed the wrong thing. That pain is pain and it is no different for one to another. But it is. I find this so aggravating.

I have: forgotten to get refills on time forgotten where I put my refills forgotten to call in refills I have even forgotten my husband's (only) prescription and had to pay out of pocket because I didn't get the preapproval done. This is turning into a real problem. I have been having a problem for months with increased pain in my hands and feet. Now my back has been more of a problem as well. It turns out I completely forgot to get my prescription anti-inflammatory refilled. No wonder I have been having more pain. In our old house, I had a system. I kept all the prescription bottles on the top shelf of the closet closest to my side of our bed. Every week I sit down and refill our pill boxes. I put all the bottles in two rows on the bed, prescriptions in one row and OTC (mostly vitamins) in the other row. Then I fill my husband's pill box with his prescription, move on to the OTC we both take, and close his box and put it aside. Then I go back to my pill box, adding all my prescriptions and then the rest of the OTC items. If I empty a bottle or nearly empty a bottle, I put them aside until I am done and then I get a refill or replacement as needed so by the next week we have all the pills we need and we never run out. At our new house, first we were very disorganized and there is no closet near my side of the bed. I kept all the prescription bottles in big zip lock bags on the floor in the corner. After a few weeks, I found a little book case, which doesn't hold books, to hold all my bottles. I keep everything there. Then one day a week, I put all the pill bottles on the bed, prescriptions in one row and OTC in another. I sit down and fill all the boxes as before. Sounds good? Well for some reason, I keep screwing up. I don't know if its because of more RA problems with my hands or that I am not focusing or something, but each week I find as I go through the week, that my pills are messed up. Sometimes I am missing one in a box, or have an extra in another. Or I find that I have missed a pill all week. This morning I realized that perhaps one reason why my hands haven't been very good is that I have not been taking my prescription anti-inflammatory pills. I don't even have a bottle for them. I checked online and found that I haven't refilled it since late January which makes sense why I am out now. But I have no idea when I last took it. Anyway, I sent in a request for a refill and will pick it up later today. However, the real problem is that I need to fix my system so I stop screwing up.

Once you get cancer, you spend the rest of your life wondering at some level 'will it come back?' or 'will they catch it in time?' The biggest thing about learning to cope with a cancer diagnosis is learning to squish that evil little voice that asks 'will it come back?' when ever you aren't expecting. Sometimes I feel I need a little punching bag or something that I can smash with a baseball bat and beat the crap out of when I feel the need.

Because of that evil man who jacked up the price of a drug because he could and didn't care about the patients, the FDA has moved to see if they can expedite reviews of certain generic drugs (the pound). ""The agency plans to expedite reviews of applications for generic drugs where only one treatment is currently sold."" I like this idea. A lot. Since a generic is essentially the same (but not quite exactly) of existing patented medications, the approval process is much easier than for brand new drugs (or so I believe). The problem is the agency has a backlog of generic medication applications. So now they will see if they can speed some up. The more generics available, the better.

666,31,35,14,3,2016,2016-03-14,"Life after cancer can be very different than before it. Forget all that 'new normal' crap, I'm talking about how to tell new people in your life about your cancer history. This includes dating post cancer, just making new friends, and even new employers. After a cancer diagnosis, you move to 'cancerland' and are basically stuck there for the rest of your life. As life goes on you meet new people as do non-cancer people. But the difference is when, and if, you tell them about your medical history and cancer. Let's tackle these one by one. First of all when you get a new job after cancer, you should never tell your new employer about your cancer even if you get a new diagnosis. They do not need to know. You are not legally required to tell them. If you have medical appointments, they do not need to know why. You can always say something like 'I have an issue that needs to be dealt with'. And if you need chemo or radiation again which will require frequent absences you can just say you have a medical condition that may require alterations in your schedule for a while. It is your decision if you want to share your medical issues with your employer and, if you do, it will be held against you at some point. No matter that there are anti-discrimination laws, you will be discriminated against. You will become a 'sick person' in someone's mind and will blatantly or subtly become the subject of discriminatory practices. Miss out on a promotion etc because you may not be able to grow with the position or could miss too much work because of your medical issues. So keep your mouth shut. New friends? That's different. When you feel comfortable in the relationship you can tell them about your cancer if you want. It depends on how open a person you are. And how you think they might react. Some people (because they are idiots) head for the hills at the word cancer, others will wrap you in a protective blanket and try to baby you, and others may try to drive you crazy with their attempts to make you a healthy person by following their misguided attempts to force you to alter your life to that of a grain, eating raw vegan who runs marathons (or anything you are not - I am not against vegans I am just not a vegan and don't want to, nor do I want to run a marathon). Note: none of these people are your friends. The people who are your friends will treat you the same as they did before they knew about your medical history. Dating? Same deal. I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer before my freshman and sophomore years. My father called the dean because I was late coming back after summer break because of my surgery. I told a few friends and it was somewhat a known fact while I was in school but I didn't discuss it much. But I did date and tried to be a normal college student as much as possible and didn't let my cancer distract me from normal college student activities such as parties, football games, bar hopping, cramming for exams, staying up really late, and binge watching old movies on Saturdays with a group of friends. But later on when I was out in the real world, dating was different. Should I tell that hot new guy or not? Eventually I learned that there was no reason to share my cancer history until the relationship got serious. Basically, if they were close enough to me to see the medications I took daily, realized I took more than the average human being, and asked me why I needed them, that might be a good place to start. I had roommates for years that I never told about my medical history because I just didn't consider it their business. Some boyfriends I told, some I didn't. If it was a short term relationship that wasn't going anywhere, why bother? If a relationship was getting serious, it could become shared information. But it really didn't rush to share the information. Maybe I am a fairly private person but I never have found a reason to rush to share the information, unless I was is at a cancer focused organization or something. I guess what I am saying is that there is no reason to share your medical history if you don't want to. People don't need to know the specifics unless you want them to. If you are diagnosed with cancer, it is your choice to share or not. Society has become more open about cancer than in the 1980s when I was first diagnosed, but it doesn't mean you have to tell anyone you don't want to.

667,31,36,13,3,2016,2016-03-13,"Genetic testing has been researched like mad in recent years. Breast cancer genetic testing is no different than that the rest of genetic testing. But treatment options are not right up there with the testing results. When this mother found out she had breast cancer she went for a lumpectomy to be followed by radiation and that would be it. But then she went back to her doctor to discuss radiation. More genetic testing had been done and she had inherited an alteration to a gene that is needed to repair DNA. And if radiation breaks DNA so it might be better for her to skip radiation and have a double mastectomy instead. So she talked to a professor of genetics and medicine who said that information was wrong and she should be able to go ahead as originally planned. Then a group of doctors met and couldn't reach a consensus so they left the decision up to her on what to do. I am so glad I am not in this woman's shoes. That would be a horrible decision to be forced to make. Which option would be better? Or which might lead her to a quicker death? I could not imagine the emotional stress. And this shows a real problem that I had thought might be lurking in the background of progress. I have long been nervous iffy edgy unsure about the fast pace of research in some areas and the slower pace of advancements in other areas would be gaps that would leave the patient over a barrel so to speak. Some research takes longer than others to complete for a start and some times it takes longer to get to the starting point. Perhaps we might need a bit more coordination here to lessen these gaps. But since we can't undo time, here lies the question: if research has lead us to the discovery of this new gene and how it might potentially impact a patient's tolerance of treatment, should the patient even be told about the gene? Since there is no research showing how it might or might not impact the success or risk of radiation treatment, how is a patient supposed to react? I just think its blatantly unfair for a doctor to tell a patient that you have this gene that might or might not impact your course of treatment and we have no options to give you so you have to figure it out on your own. I would start by getting a new doctor who would provide guidance and reassurance to help make the patient feel confident that she is making a good decision.",0,1,0.08196576151121604

Seriously, the absolute worst thing that can happen to a patient if other people decide to share their diagnosis publicly. Imagine that you get a diagnosis and it ends up as the front page of your local newspaper? (This must happen to celebrities with the National Enquirer, and similar publications, all the time.) Or, you go to a theater and have the emcee start with a spotlight on you and the announcement, 'let's welcome Caroline and her newest cancer diagnosis'. That would really suck.

I have a therapist for talking about stuff and I have a meds therapist who keeps me on an even keel. So any issues with depression are held back. I have people to talk things out with. And I know my ailments are not in my head. I get exercise to help maintain my body as much as I can before my ailments compromise it further. Its not age that is doing this to me. But so many people just don't get it. I have a friend with a chronically bad back who has a fair amount of pain. But she doesn't see a doctor about it. She does occasionally see a physical therapist. She has no prescriptions for pain meds because she gets her sister's prescription. She doesn't exercise regularly. And she doesn't understand how I live in pain and have to beg off on group events or leave early. Since she's there and in pain she doesn't understand why I can't stick around. I also have friends who want to go out at night to do things. Since not much is allowed to get between me and my 930 pm self imposed curfew, I don't go out much. If I do, it needs to have a comfy chair that provides good support. And it can't include any amount of walking or standing. Finally I have an expiration period. If I am out too long, I spend a long time recovering. So if a friend is late and I spend time waiting around for them, especially if I am standing, I don't get to fully enjoy my time out and end up leaving early to go home and rest before I need to spend a couple days recovering. Therefore I don't spend time with friends who are late. My husband does understand me. He claims that if I do things I shouldn't or for too long, I am crabby for a day or two. Apparently he doesn't like me when I am crabby. Maybe I should rip off that fake smile and let my inner crabbiness show and then more people might get it.",0,1,0.03454545454545454

This one claims to have found a cancer mutation weakness that could be identified. And if it could be identified then it could be isolated and targeted. Then it could be stopped or 'cut off' and cancer could potentially be stopped. It sounds great on paper. And it might work out in the future. After a few years of research followed by five to seven years of testing. So in a decade this might make a difference to patients. I am getting tired of this. New medical research is always taking place. But it takes so long to actually make a difference to patients. This is actually stressful to the patients who are waiting for treatment and a new medication to save them. Here's the problem. The media now announces every new medical breakthrough as it is discovered which may or may not actually lead to a new treatment option in a decade or so. With the internet and newer technology the news is spread far and wide. This reaches all the patients and the families who are waiting for the treatments. Then as the drug development process starts, patients follow this information. And as drugs go through clinical trials, patients start lobbying the FDA to release drugs early and rush them through clinical trials. Which is not a great idea. Think about all those drugs that are recalled by the FDA after additional research finds out that they are harmful. But I digress.

I can understand the desire to change a healthcare plan which is hated by some and loved by others simply because it was the first pass at a national health plan. Obviously it needs some tweaks. Some want to add to it, some want to change it, and some want to replace it. I hope none would remove it. While I understand the need or desire for change, I really hope that health insurance is not taken away from anyone who already received it under the current plan.If the ACA allowed someone to finally get health insurance, could they really take it away? Many of us sick unhealthy people previously faced the barrier of not being able to get or keep health insurance after a not so good diagnosis. I hope those days do not return. Seriously could some of the people who most need health insurance have it taken away? This is a real concern for me. I realize that one of the biggest complaints of the ACA is the mandate that all citizens have health insurance or face a penalty. I can accept that. Some people just don't want a requirement like this in their life, whether it is desire not to have the government intruding in their life or that they do not feel the need for health insurance.. That is their right. But the people who want health insurance and couldn't afford it, were rejected by their insurance company, or any other reason, should still be able to have health insurance. Health insurance should not be taken away from anyone who has it and wants to keep it. Also any one who still does not have health insurance and wants it should still have it accessible.

So maybe I was tired. Actually I was so tired, I couldn't focus on much. If you can't watch a Lifetime Movie because you can't focus, you must be tired. In the past my criteria was if you are too sick to focus on the weather channel, you must be really sick. (I learned that lesson while stuck in a hotel with the stomach flu on a business trip.) It is hard to focus and function like a human being if you are not fed and rested. Those are basic facts. I don't have problems with the food side of the equation (my inner size 8 is protesting) but I clearly have problems keeping up with my rest. I have to work on my napping skills. The biggest problem that napping causes is not getting enough sleep at night. Your body needs along period sleep to get to that REM stage of restful sleeping. Its bad enough when I wake up in the middle of the night and am not rested the next day. But if I nap too much then I will have problems getting sleep at night. Today I am tired again but not as bad.

The same purply brown paint was used in the hall bathroom. Making it look like another cave. The kitchen is this ugly taupe/tan which continues into the dining room and living room and the upstairs hall and the third bedroom. The second bedroom and the master bathroom are pale green - also known as cucumber by Benjamin Moore. Initially I hated it but its growing on me. Then the downstairs, where do I begin? The majority of the main area is painted a dark, dark, dark blue. If you rub your fingers or anything else on the paint it leaves a mark. Evidently the previous owners wanted a gaming/theater area to be really dark. They even replaced the drop ceiling tiles with black acoustical tile. And they used blue painters tape to hide the white runners between the drop ceiling tiles. The rest of the room is decent a lighter tan which is nice with the white trim. My aspirations include repainting the entire inside of the house. I have no thoughts that I can do it in a reasonable period of time. I had thought I could paint a room each week. There is no wallpaper here that needs to be removed. The walls are in pretty good shape. I need to spackle, tape, and wash the walls first. I started by getting a nice pale peach for the hall bathroom that will also be used in the kitchen. That was Monday. I painted Monday. I did more on Tuesday but I was so exhausted from Monday.

We have our emotional highs and lows and we keep on going. We hear about the potential risks and problems at each treatment. We hope for the best and sometimes cope with the worst. We develop ways to cope and move on and grow. But what about the doctors and nurses and other medical professionals? I have never really stopped to think about them and how they cope. First of all in their jobs, every day is like Groundhog Day. They must deliver good and bad news, administer tests and watch their patients react. They help cure and heal some patients, and are forced to watch others slip away. That must be incredibly difficult. It must represent a failure for those who took the oath to 'do no harm'. They work hard to help their patients and then some they can't help. So what is your job? Engineer, cook, parent, soldier, butcher, baker, candlestick maker? What if what you make is a total flop? How does that make you feel? But what if its not just a flop but someone loses their life? And what about the further burden of a patient who follows their advice to a T and still doesn't make it?

Then you have friends and family who obsess about your ailment and call and email constantly for the latest worst of wisdom imparted by your medical team. They often offer their 'advice' in return saying things like 'I can't understand why your doctor hasn't given you [insert the name of the treatment given to their neighbor's dog walker's cousin's hair dresser when they had a completely different diagnosis fifteen years ago]. They also want to know every time you have the least minor issue so they can be 'informed' about how you are doing.

Again, they are not really your friend either. The people who are your friends are the ones who stop by and visit, call and just listen, and treat you like a human being, while you are trying not to lose your lunch after your latest infusion. Hang out with these people. Finally, you have the person closest to you: your spouse/partner/best friend. Too many people find themselves suddenly single after a cancer diagnosis, in particular. I know we had our ups and downs with my breast cancer diagnosis. But I can't tell you how many friends have spoken of their spouse's lack of support, or even departure. My husband has been wonderful. For the last three years, he has given me my weekly injections for Rheumatoid Arthritis, because I cannot deal with the idea of giving myself a shot.

He came with me to every chemo infusion where we played scrabble during the infusions (and he would delight in winning when the drugs kicked in and I could only form two letter words). He only stopped going with me when I insisted he couldn't keep missing work for weekly infusions. Now he will go with me to any medical appointment I request him to.

Without a cancer (or other icky) diagnosis, do we view the definitiveness (yes that's a real word - I had to look it up) of our lives differently than with one? Does the hanging sword called cancer, redefine us, or how does it redefine us? I struggle with this one sometimes. I was barely an adult (19) when cancer first dropped into my life. Therefore I am not sure I would know how to be an adult without cancer. But have I learned to embrace every day for what it is? I'm not sure either. I do agree that once cancer appears, life in Cancerland is very different than life without cancer. At my second diagnosis I was pushed deeper into Cancerland than I was before. So as I was pushed in deeper, I pushed back and focused on taking better care of me emotionally. I was more sure of what I was not going to let cancer do to me again - it was not going to take any more fun out of my life. Or suck any more time emotionally from me. Now almost 9 years from diagnosis number two, do I still feel that hanging cancer sword over my head? Yes. But I feel I have pushed it up higher and further away. Has it changed me? Yes, and I hope I am a better person than before. After my first diagnosis, if someone I knew also knew someone with cancer, they would somehow get me in contact with them. I didn't always feel comfortable talking to someone I didn't really know who had cancer. Because I had cancer, I was supposed to want to talk about it? I didn't. And that wasn't the best way to cope with my health. Now I reach out people I meet with cancer, because I don't want anyone to go through all the same hell I went through. I want to help them push that hanging sword further away. Let them embrace their life and not live under that sword. From the article I read: ""The gift of the diagnosis — and it’s a tough one to embrace, but what choice do we have? — is to dedicate ourselves instead to embracing every day with the particular passion that comes from knowing the number is finite. I am just as glad I don’t know the number of days remaining to either one of us, but I know every day, I have one less. I had better make the best of them all.""",0,1,0.18522025813692478

When scientists exposed lab dishes of human cancer cells (liver, breast, colon, ovarian) to the diabetes drugs sitagliptin (sold by Merck as Januvia) and saxagliptin (AstraZeneca’s Onglyza), the cells migrated more. And when nine mice with human tumors were given either of the drugs, the cells metastasized more and invaded far-flung tissue...."" Did you read that right? Yes you did! The previously thought wonderful anti-oxidants appear to help metastasize cancer! So if you have cancer, your cancer will spread faster with help from the anti-oxidants. Nice! They are off my diet for now. But the writers add that they did not cause cancer, just that they helped it spread. And this is a mouse test which means that it may not be the same for humans. And more research is needed. So I am not jumping to any conclusions here. I know its only a mouse test but these results do not make me happy.",0,1,0.23804189857761288

Actually its about every two months for one doctor, every six months (or two or six weeks if there is a medication change for another), and then for anyone else who wants it. Sometimes I feel like there is a vampire who wants my blood. Yesterday I had to go for blood work for one doctor's appointment next week and for another doctor's follow up request. I can't just go for blood work. I need to plan its so its before my weekly injections. Anyway I got the results this morning. My thyroid tests are way off. This means my endocrinologist will call and probably want to change my dosage or at least have questions for me since the last time I had this test done my results were completely different than this or from the time before. Think yoyo results. My CBC is partly okay and partly worse than normal. My MTX levels (the blood work you need with on methotrexate for my rheumatoid) are also partly okay and partly worse than normal. This means my rheumatologist may also make changes when I see her next week. Both changes, if they happen, will require additional blood work to follow the results. I hate going for blood work. Its complicated (see above). I hate needles. They can only use one arm so options are limited. I have scrawny veins in my elbow so sometimes they have to 'look around'. Or if they wimp out, they use the big vein on the back of my hand - which is painful. Then I get to play the 'let's see what the latest results are' game and see if I need more medication changes.

My husband was great and got up quietly. The (good) cat was another story. He came into the bedroom at 515 AM meowing for me. When he is upset at all, he needs to find me to make him happy again. He is not good about being quiet with this. Its a behavior change since he had his big adventure and was lost for 9 days. All that it means to me is that its 10 AM and I need a nap. We have house guests coming tonight until Monday. We are having a family dinner here for 10 tonight. I already made brownies and need to finish the sweet potatoes.

In one instance a friend of mine who was a heavy smoker was told he had to prove he had quit smoking for a month before the doctor would perform his back surgery. Yes, I know smoking is a nasty dirty habit. Yes, I know it can do horrible things to your lungs and the rest of your body. Yes, I know quitting smoking is a very good way to improve your health. But, the doctor had his surgery scheduled and then he was in a fender bender so it had to be delayed. Now the doctor won't schedule his surgery until he has quit smoking. So if my friend needed to quit smoking because of surgery concerns, why did the doctor not make this an issue before? Why is it now? This does not make sense. Then another friend who is a grandmother and is long since done having children wants to have a hysterectomy. She even has fibroids and her doctor says no. She's not ready? What?

I quit working last fall when working four hours in a day made me have the need to take a nap. My fatigue levels are very high. For example, if I go out for more than a few hours, I need to come home and lie down. I have been known to walk in the door and head straight for the bed or couch - which ever is closer - before anything else. When I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and rheumatoid in the fall of 2012, immediately I began to have problems with fatigue. I left my other job at the cancer center because it took too much out of me. It also required evening meetings and weekend events which I could no longer do. First I cut back on my hours by by June of 2013, I left completely. Then I tried to work closer to 20 hours at my remaining job (the one I just left) but over the next two years I had to cut back my hours because I couldn't last through a 6 hour day, three times a week. Then it was 5 hours a day, and then 4 hours a day. Then it was two days a week instead of three. I am a fan of social services programs which provide help for those in need.

You then start making decisions as you learn about your choices. And proceed to get your life back. But.... What if the news is wrong or has been misinterpreted? Then what? This is especially true now with BRCA and other gene testing advances. ""In a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the Peter Mac team has demonstrated that some genetic tests for breast cancer may be misinterpreted, potentially misinforming the affected families and risking unnecessary preventive treatments. “It is now possible to screen a large number of genes at the same time – known as panel testing – at a fraction of the cost previously required to sequence just one cancer-causing gene such as BRCA1,” according to Professor Ian Campbell, Head of Peter Mac’s Genetic Cancer Research Laboratory. “Understandably, this has increased demand for such tests amongst health care providers and patients concerned about their family history. “However, while the increased risk of breast cancer associated with some genetic mutations is proven, for others there is a lack of robust scientific data to suggest preventative treatments are required.”"" There is a fair amount known about the BRCA genes and their impact on a patient for increased risk of breast cancer or other ailments. But not as much for the other genes. So you do not want to start making a lot of decisions right away. You do n't want to treat the information about other mutations the same as BRCA mutations. I guess the message is that you need to educate yourself on what you are being tested for before you make decisions",0,1,0.038278537326388896

Drug companies are creating programs to help patients take their pills. Yes its part of a money making program. The more people who take their pills the more they can sell - as the cynical side of me says. But the real problem is people who do not take their pills get sicker and sicker. This drives up the cost of medical care in the US. (Which uses up more health care money so big sticker medications are in the spotlight for a smaller share of the remaining money.) Time to stop being cynical. Think of it this way, a patient goes to the doctor for an ailment. The doctor prescribes a medication for which the patient never fills the prescription, or if they do fill it, they forget to take it. If they had taken their medication regularly, they would feel better and not need the surgery they eventually had. Medical research is done so that we get better and live longer. One of the problems is affordability of the medications. Pharma companies have long since had payment options for the uninsured which does help some. Another problem is that some people get the mind set that no pill will help them. Or other reasons they come up with not to take the pills. Or side effects, fear of side effects, or no perceived effect by the medication. Along with basic forgetfulness - something we all suffer from time to time. A friend hurt her back recently and said she had a bad night the other night and was in a lot of pain - she forgot to take her prescription....

My husband thought it was an expensive luxury and wasn't too happy I insisted on getting one. We can just say we have a difference of opinion on the subject but as I said it was the one thing I wanted with a new house, we got one. I need to do everything I can to make sure I can sleep. The new bed finally arrived yesterday, in the middle of a snow storm (expected accumulation of 4-8"" which turned into 10+"" and a six hour power outage). It was snowing enough that we were concerned it would still be delivered as scheduled. I called to confirm around 11 am and they were out on the road. So I called the plow company and he said he would be here in an hour or so. I crossed my fingers that the plow would get here before the delivery truck. Of course not. Our new house has a fairly long driveway with a hill sloping down from the road to the house. The delivery guys showed up and parked on the street as I doubt they could have gotten the truck back out of the driveway. They slide the base of the power bed, which is fairly heavy, down the driveway in its box. It was a big sled essentially. They unwrapped it outside and set it up in the bedroom. Then they dragged the old mattress and box spring up the hill and slide the new mattress down the hill (definitely got a workout). My husband got out of work early because of the storm. When he arrived he had to leave to go run some errands because the driveway still wasn't plowed. I called the plow company again.... An hour later the driveway was plowed and my husband could actually get in the house. Due to the lack of power, I couldn't show him how the bed goes up and down and you can adjust it and get really comfy. He did lie down on it to read and I could hear the snoring from the living room. He also admitted that it was comfortable. As soon as the power came on, I readjusted it so we were really comfy. Then when we went to bed last night, I raised the head of the bed a tiny bit (because one of the real points of this bed is that the head of the bed could be raised to reduce snoring). This morning, my husband slept in a bit. He admitted to sleeping well. Me? I was very comfortable. It was every penny.

Eventually you start to feel better and get to that 'new normal' crap they tell you about. And then something starts to not be right with your body and you go back to the doctor and find out your oh-so-wonderful cancer treatment has left you with a side effect that might kill you on its own. I know people who this has happened to. My sister in law's sister was treated with radiation to her chest in her teens for Hodgkin's and ended up dying of breast cancer at 47. A woman at the gym, her daughter just had a very serious heart attack at the age of 53 as a result of her treatment for Hodgkin's as well. A friend has heart damage as the result of her breast cancer chemotherapy. And I can go on. My rheumatologist is considering switching my treatment combination for my RA but is concerned about side effects that could potentially cause life long problems for me. I also need a yearly chest x-ray, which is standard procedure for those on one of my medications, to make sure I am not causing permanent damage to my lungs. As medications get stronger to treat more and more ailments, their potential side effects can be deadly. One of the most important parts of clinical trials is balancing the potential side effects from a specific dose, with out killing the patient. They cure you from one disease and end up killing you from something else as a result in the long run. Does this seem right? It does not to me. I am not very happy about this. But what options do I have? There are people who say they cured themselves through some diet change, a secret potion found on an island in the South Pacific, or becoming a raw paleo vegan or something. None of those options appeal to me. I do my best to take care of me but I also try to live my life the way I want. I do take my Western medicine and hope the side effects will not kill me in the long run. This is the part of the system that needs to be changed.",0,1,0.12257378038628036

How is use of drugs and the culture behind the scenes of professional bike riding eventually fell apart. This lead to him being banned for life from bike riding. In one part of the article, one of his former team members stated that he had a 'cancer shield' instead of being a 'cancer survivor'. I was very intrigued by the term 'cancer shield' which lead to me thinking. (Sorry, I know I should never think too much.) So I am familiar with idea of the 'cancer card', which is from Kris Carr's Crazy Sexy Cancer.This idea allows you to get out of certain things you really do not want to do.... like lunch with your boss - you can say 'well I'm not feeling that well' and sigh. I mean god for bid you might have a relapse as a result of lunch with your boss. Or you swipe that cancer card to justify buying a funky pair of new shoes.... But if you abuse that 'cancer card', do you create a 'cancer shield'? Abusing the shield would allow you to justify bad behavior by hiding behind your cancer. Its one thing to buy those fancy shoes to celebrate ending chemo. I bought myself a fancy watch in fact. But buying a new pair of shoes every day would be irresponsible and lead to a whopping credit card bill. Was Lance Armstrong using a cancer shield to hide his bad behavior and abuse of prohibited drugs? I'm not sure.

Both my grandfather's died of cancer - one of prostate cancer and one of gall bladder cancer, in their 80s. Some of my great aunts and uncles who smoked died of cancer as well. But none were very young and they were smokers. The definition of family history of cancer is: ""You may have a strong family history if any of the following situations apply to you: More than 2 close relatives on the same side of your family have had cancer – the same side of your family means either your father’s relatives or your mother’s relatives The relatives have had the same type of cancer, or different cancers that can be caused by the same gene fault The cancers developed when the family members were young, below the age of 50 One of your relatives has had a gene fault found by genetic tests It is important to remember that cancer is most common in people over the age of 60 and is rarer in young people. So cancer in older people is less likely to be due to an inherited cancer gene."" Then along came me: first cancer at age 19 and second at age 45. How did that happen? Who knows. The one thing I have learned, through lots of therapy and support groups, is that I can't beat myself up about it. (It is important to remember in life that nothing that happened can be undone, and unless you intentionally did something, do not blame yourself. You can blame your lung cancer on your chain smoking or your skin cancer on your tanning bed addiction but otherwise skip the self blame.) But I digress. Most cancers are not from family history. Despite all the publicity about the BRCA genes, something like less than 10% of breast cancer cases are attributed to them. There is also an obscure genetic mutation called Cowden's Syndrome, which has thyroid cancer and breast cancer as symptoms. But I don't have that. So basically I do not have a family history of cancer and some how I got the short straw. We have no idea how I ended up this (un)healthy. I don't really care how this happened and I am not going to waste any more energy on stressing about it. The unfortunate part is that I now have an increased risk of getting another cancer.

She loves having comments and new requests for subjects to be covered, so please help her in that way.; I am also considering translating Kedda’s version of Private Parts for our times, since not many of my readers can understand what’s gwannin on. Funny that, seeing as how I’ve even taken the trouble to illustrate it: there is a massive pic of a deccoed moufleur staring out at the reader. The only person who understood what the pic really is, was my friend Sue, who is a gynaecologist in America. Well, that’s a no-brainer, as Doreen would say.; I was astonished to read Caitlyn Moran’s Times Magazine article on the Camel Toe, and to see her read it out on Youtube. Talking about her vagina, she says ‘In another world, I’d like to think I’d be in the running for a prize to acknowledge its munificence — in the same way others are rewarded for growing a large sunflower or marrow.’; Well, this other world she is describing is Kedda’s world, the world described in Private Parts! Kedda spends all day in the salon, decorating people’s genitals. Indeed, because everyone has their face covered by a darsk, from birth, their only outlet for self-expression is through the extravagant grooming of their moufleurs and vaddervanillis.; I knew my timing was right! The world is ready for Kedda and her fokkadokka understanding of the trilly fashwerve. I just need to translate it from Keddaling, quick.; The world is also ready for Doreen, because there are too many long-drawn-out tutorials online.

708,33,10,28,12,2015,2015-12-28,"Hi, sorry! As I have been out of action on the blogging front.; I have however been working ceaselessly behind the scenes to bring you my new story, ‘Private Parts’. Unfortunately, in order to read it, you have to learn a new language, the book, being set thirty years in the future, having forced me to write it in an evolved version of English. Yeah, it’s a right bore. I thought I would give you just one page at a time though (starting mozapan) so as not to freap you out nor nukeyflip your thortpacs…see, not too hard is it?; It is a joy, making up a new language. I remember sitting on the floor in my sister Penel’s room, at 67 Barton Road, opening a blue book of blank paper, and deciding to have a go at it. We must have been about eight years old. Remember we had no telly, and were on a whole different level of naivety than kids these days, or even kids those days. Our conversation went something like this: ‘Hmm, OK, so…what will ‘tree’ be? ‘; Penel pulled random sounds out of her brain to come up with something like: ‘Fligol?’; ‘Yes. Perfect. ‘Fligol’,’ (writing down ‘Fligol – Tree’.) ‘And what will…erm…’house’ be?’; ‘Mmm…’plotchlotch’?’; ‘Yeah. Plotchlotch. Brilliant.’ (writing down ‘Plotchlotch – House.’); ‘What about ….’two’, ‘three’?’; ‘Well, we need to start at ‘one’. ‘One’ should be ….’blonk.’’; ‘Ok, ‘Blonk’…’; ‘And ‘two’ should be….’; ‘…’Plizza’!’; ‘ ‘Plizza’, of course. And ‘three’ should be….’Ndolik’. Yes.’; My sister read over my shoulder ‘Blonk, Plizza, Ndolik.’; We laughed. Probably for about five minutes. We always made the most of simple pleasures.; ‘It’s going to be quite a difficult language to learn,’ observed my sister, gasping for breath.; ‘We haven’t finished yet. We need a word for ‘the.’’; ‘Hmm. ‘The’ could be….’eekin’.’; ‘Eekin,’ yes, OK.’; ‘What about ‘is’? We need ‘is.’ How about ‘drippock’ for ‘is’?’; ‘So…if ‘big’ is say….’flagganoo’ then ‘the house is big’ will be ‘Eekin…plotchlotch….drippock…flagganoo.’; Unwieldy as it was, with a bit of practise, we got it down: ‘Eekin plotchlotch drippock flagganoo.’; It was dawning on us that we needed all the colours, all the numbers, all the names of all the objects in the world. We entered a state of mild panic. I remember looking around desperately at all the things: the window! the road! the sky! the clouds! the cupboard! and saying something like ‘We haven’t got anything for ‘floor’, what’s ‘floor’? How about ‘shally-gling-gling’? We took turns to write it all down.; ‘God, we need a word for ‘word,’ I exclaimed, increasingly appalled at the enormity of the task.; We soon realised we needed words not only for all the objects but also all the concepts. It just got bigger and bigger. We ended up with pages and pages. I wish I could find them now, as I would love a good vlatt, but they are not to be found.; We had of course not understood that a language evolves over centuries, organically, through the need to communicate. The resulting eccentricities, similar to the quirky bends and kinks in a woodland path, formed as walkers wend their way around trees and shrubs, are the fascinating hooks that make you love to learn a language. You can’t really just make one up. It’s too artificial.; Anyway, so now, forty years on, I have, I hope, understood a bit more about language, in order to bring you ‘Private Parts’, the book. I showed the first page to Grampa the other day. He read the opening: ‘My tretcher turned itself off.’ ‘Och! What’s ‘tretcher’?’ he said. He read the second sentence. ‘ ‘My slozerlok opened.’ What’s slozerlok? Och! What does it mean?’ It was getting him in a terrible panic. I explained that the reader has to suspend the need to know what it means, and learn from the context. A few days later I asked him if he had read any more of it. ‘No!’ he said. ‘I cannae face it! It would have to be a labour of love.’; My experience of attempting to learn Modern Greek to university standard in one year was very like this. Every sentence I read had two or three or even four words I didn’t know. I started out very keen, looking them all up in the dictionary and writing them into the book in neat pencil, but it took so bloody long. I started by necessity to hone my not very scholarly ability to suspend my need to know. It meant that I never got that good at Modern Greek, but at least I had partially read the works, and was increasingly brilliant at imagining what they might be meaning.; Please imagine the movie of ‘Private Parts’ as you read. It will, I think, be fascinating for the audience to try to guess who the actors are for the entire first three quarters of the movie. Then, as the darsks (dark masks, see I’m helping you) come off, they’ll be like ‘Ooh, it’s Johnny Depp! Should have guessed from his vaddervanilli. And Damn! No one struts a moufleur like Meryl. It’s obvious now that you know!’ (By three quarters of the way through, the more language-oriented section of the audience will, of course, be fluent in Keddaling and will, one hopes, be confidently using ‘vaddervanilli’ for ‘willy’ and ‘moufleur’ for ‘vagina’.); I realise that I wouldn’t have been able to write ‘Private Parts’ without first writing ‘Shardonnay’ and ‘Wantababy’ and even the tits book from 2007, ‘A Breast of the Times’, which broke down my every last barrier to writing down embarrassing things. This new one though is the worst of the lot, and as Grampa says, (although how he can he know, not having performed his labour of love yet?) ‘plumbs new depths’.; First page of ‘Private Parts’ will be posted later today.

709,33,100,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"It is the dawn chorus outside. Half past four in the morning. Katze is awake but humans are asleep. So I thought I would bother you dear readers instead.; Thing is, I have hit a teensy low.; I plucked the Lung Nodules out of the back of Ferdinandos’ mind and popped them into Google. You see, my cousin Jeanie had put a comment on my Nodules post. It said ‘Sorry about the nodules, Hester.’ Hang on, Jeanie is a nurse. She must know what the hell nodules are all about. And if she’s sorry about them that means they are not good.; Within minutes of investigating lung nodules I became convinced I don’t have long. Any lung nodules are 40% likely to be malignant. Mine are more likely as I already have cancer. And radiation to chest area as a teenager? Not good. And Metastatic Disease, which is what this would entail for me, is not curable, only treatable. It kills many people.; Another worrying thing was that every time the main symptom came up for metastatic lung cancer it was ‘shortness of breath’. I have had shortness of breath. Well, more like shallowness and rapidity of breathing. At night.; Fred says two little 7mm nodules wouldn’t make me short of breath. He also says I’ve probably had the nodules for years, and they are probably due to a tiny injury from having the lung drained when I was young. Kind Fred. Although he was reluctant to pick Bash up from a party because he wanted to watch the football. It was only when I boohooed ‘Bash doesn’t want a ba-ha-hald mother with a stu-hu-hu-pid hat on picking her up,’ that he realised I had got myself into a bit of a state.; Have been awake most of the night softly singing ‘We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun….’ and, a bit louder ‘Goodbye Papa, it’s hard to diiiiiiie, when all the birds are singing in the skyyyyyyy….’ I mean, Mets means Stage IV. I thought I was Stage 2. I could handle Stage 2. It would be a bit sudden to have to zoom up to Stage IV.; The thing is, life is sweet to me. I have dear memories of our planet, as do we all. You can skip the next 24 paragraphs if you can’t stand the idea of a brief run-down of my lifetime memories. I know it is self-indulgent but I want to note them down just in case the lunglumps kill me.; Age five, we rowed a little boat through the reeds in our ‘mango swamp’ on holiday in Achmelvich, Scotland. We would visit all our Scottish cousins. Sometimes we went for lunch at Auntie Jean’s which was very posh as Uncle Bill was a General and they had a butler. Age six I visited Great Granny in Jamaica and guzzled unlimited warm mangoes from the tree. I remember camping in the Dormobile by a crisp cool lake in Switzerland eating the fish we had caught. I made a first friend, Jenny Young, who made me realise that jeans were better than dresses. At home we always had entertaining lodgers: Sandy, Miriami, Carmen and Anna, Natalia. I remember Auntie Lindesay playing the piano while I read Ferdinand the bull with Uncle George. I can see my brother Fergus, in the garden at Barton Road, serving us up the first asparagus he had managed to grow.; I flick through memories like in a flip-book: the cottage in the Highland village of Badluarach where we found Kimmy, our little dog. Singing along to Abba songs and The Boom Town Rats’ ‘I don’t like Mondays’ with my brother Pete on piano. A train trip to Nancy to stay with La Famille Brancher to learn French. My first ride on a small black pony when we were staying in Newcastle with the Hovendens. Fergus watching ‘Roots’, showing me anti-vivisection leaflets and helping me prepare my Health Food talk for school by making me declaim again and again Yudkin’s ‘Sugar is a Pure, White and Deadly Poison!’ I remember him going vegan, cooking Mugi Miso and Apricots Hunza-style, training to be an athlete.; I have a whole mental flip book from our time in Bristol: the view over the city from Upper Belgrave Road, crazy-steep hills for biking, my thumb being hit by a hockey stick and the nail falling off, the mad drunken loon who burst into the house when Pete was playing the bagpipes. My dad told him to get out or he would call the police. ‘Fook the Fookin Police,’ slurred the man. Our cat Pushkin was killed on the road (not a good memory.) I ran on the Downs with my sister and Kimmy, and spent weekends out in the Mendips with Georgina and her lovely eccentric family, the horses Firefly and Edward, her pony Silver and donkey Bertie. I would take the train to Yeovil to spend a week in a caravan with Darylle, stalking poachers in the middle of the night and galloping bareback through woods smashing our knees on branches.; Then there was Cambridge again. I cycled across a frosty Midsummer Common with my friend Hermes, she on her cool mauve racer, me on my square red bike. Latin. Science. Maths. French. English. Thank God for Mrs Findlay. She would walk into the class and read us out loud the first chapter of a really good book, like The Day of the Triffids, for example. The bell would ring and she would go. That was it. We would all go and find a copy of the book so we could finish it.; How could you forget interrailing with Nellen? Our first brush with Greece. Ios, the party island. Conking out on the deck of ferries in our sleeping bags. Then on my Gap Yah I split the time between Chamonix working as a waitress in a creperie and Greece again to learn Greek when I lived with lovely Yolanda, Lia, Yiayia Yola, Elza and Maki in Halkidiki.; I went to Oxford to study French and Modern Greek. I loved it down in the bar with Jon, Tom, Dave, Jim, Duncan, Aziz, Becky, Christina and Hanna. I accidentally knocked on Fred’s door up Cowley Road, looking for someone else. He invited me in for a cup of tea. We stayed up all night talking.; I asked Fred if he wanted to go to Greece with me. He said ‘Yes’ before asking ‘How are we going to get there?’; ‘Erm, we’ll have to hitchhike,’ I replied.; Fred spent a lot of time catching lizards on dusty roads. We were slow. It took us five and a half weeks to get there. When we got to Greece we sat in Igoumenitsa in a cafe. Fred walked over the road and felt a tractor with his hands. When he came back I asked him why he had done that. ‘Just checking it’s 3D,’ he said. We crossed Greece to Halkidiki to see my Yolandoula. It only took us three days to get back home. You learn the tricks of the trade. Less lizards, more progress. Only get dropped off at service stations. Keep talking to the lorry drivers so they don’t go to sleep and drive you off the cliffs of mountainous northern Greece.; OMG what about the time in Amsterdam when Fred found he had a mouse living in his pocket as we had been living on bread and cheese? All the druggies living in our very cheap lodgings thought he was hallucinating when he said he had a mouse. Until it ran out of his sleeve. Then they freaked out.; So back to the flip book: a siblings’ trip to Scotland for our grandparents’ Golden Wedding, and stopping off at the beach at St Abbs on the way home. The bells heard from my room in Oxford. French novels, Greek poetry, Divinity Road for the second year and naughty chillums in Billy’s room. Playing backgammon with Hanna.; We went to see Ferg in a play in Windsor where he was a gardener for the Queen. Black’s Beach in California, boat trips, road trip to Mexico, tequila guns.; Ferg’s coffin being carried out of the church. Just awful. I will have to tell you more about this another time.; My third year in Thessaloniki with Annika, Anastasia, Angie, Audrey and Dino. This was a hugely tricky time as it was just after Ferg died. We ended that year with the discovery of Gavdhos, an island where you don’t have to wear clothes and you mould into the Juniper bushes and become part of the landscape. After four months of building dry stone walls and playing Bally Bally with Taki and Giorgo I felt a bit better and Fred realised he needed a library and went to Edinburgh to study Computer Science. Back in Cambridge in our mid-twenties we moved into number 207 Mill Road, painted flying teapots on the walls and held a Party of Special Things to Do with Wozzie, Barney, Bella, Cheryl, the strangely named Abigail Rainbird Tripp and the crazy gang including Ziggy and Dylan who gave us Zappy dog.; We hung out in The Empress and The Jubilee drinking bitter and playing pool. I experienced a short and doomed career in PR but liked fundraising for Emmaus UK even though with all the junkies it got a bit intense and I ended up with not a few homeless people sleeping on my floor. Then came moonlit explorations of Wandlebury at night with Oddly when she was a puppy and then we were living up the Roman Road in a Bedford CF van. The fire-throwers would be heading off to bed at six am just as Fred was adjusting his tie in the wing mirror to go to work. Fred did learn to juggle fire and five balls during that time though. Oddly got bonked by two naughty gypsy dogs in a bush and gave birth to two fabulous puppies, Funnily and Strangely. I thought ‘If that little dog knows how to have puppies, then surely I know how to have a baby.’; ‘Shall we make a little Alfie?’ I asked Fred.; ‘Yes’, said Fred. He had had a revelation one night. It was that he did not have enough responsibility in his life. Within a year the poor chap had a baby, a wife, a house and a little later a new job in London.; Thank God for Francoise’s yoga for pregnancy. That started everything off well. Chloe was born in hospital. She looked very strange to me, like a little misshapen alien. I was in shock. I wanted to tell my mum that she had been born. ‘There’s a phone up the corridor’ they said. I pushed her very slowly in her little bassinet thing. ‘Mum,’ I said, ‘it’s a girl. She’s called Chloe.’; ‘Oh!’ exclaimed my mum. ‘Is she the most beautiful thing you have ever seen in your life?’; I looked again more carefully. ‘Erm, actually, mum, you know, she really is!’ I said. It was instant, just like that. I loved my baby. Which made it all very simple. Plus she went to sleep for three months which helped. Fred’s mum Irene absolutely loved Chloe. She came over when the baby was four days old and just held her and looked at her for hours.; Tabby was eight days late. She chatted to Gwanny and Gwampa when she was only twenty minutes old. She wanted ding-dings all day and all night. She would craftily wrap her fingers in my hair while I was feeding her so I could not slip away without waking her. She was very funny and skilled at twizzling round in her bouncer.; Nellen, Levi and I walked up flowery tracks, breastfed our babies, made soup and toast and tea. This is Levi with Nellen’s baby Olive.; I played high Cuban flute in a London salsa band with Annie. (BTW careful if you play high flute because my old flute teacher Howard, now Hridrayamati as he is a Buddhist, tells me that flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal thought that the high notes drove a lot of players mad.) Fred looked after the girls while I rehearsed. This is Fred’s idea of childcare:; Chloe started play school. Fred’s mum sadly was diagnosed with bowel cancer during this time and died too quickly for anyone to understand what was going on. Fred’s sister Gwen and I both experienced an intense dream of her, strong and healthy, on a bus with flowing skirts and the children on her knee. Isn’t that strange?; Then when Chloe was four and Tabby two we moved to New York for a two-year stint. I cycled round Central Park and went shopping at Zabar’s with Karen (who is a chef on Good Morning America – you tend to meet the most incredible high-flyers in New York). We swam in the pool on the roof of our 44 floor building, and learnt to rollerblade and did illicit dancing in the park fountains with artist Michelle who painted the crying woman on the piano and the African children on the drum.; Really sadly, Great Granny was in an accident in her car during this time and died a few days later in hospital. I couldn’t go to her funeral as I was too pregnant and recovering from an op. She never met Alfie who was born in a jacuzzi in a birthing centre on W13th St.; We spent weekends in Bear Mountain at Tabby’s teacher Janine’s little log cabin next to a bubbling river. We discovered the beaches of Fire Island. Annie came to stay and took me to Cuban night clubs to dance salsa. We flew to San Francisco to stay with Michelle’s mum. Michelle showed us round town and took us to Yosemite.; Flip flip flip. I painted abstracts with babies a lot as it was one thing that kept Alfie happy. We found our house in Bishops Stortford and knew it was the one. Bashi was born in a pool in front of the fire at six in the morning. The dogs went outside to bark the news to the world. The neighbours’ kids came in bearing gifts on their way to school, three from next door and three from two along, like the shepherds and the wise men. We have a wonderful photo somewhere of Fred’s Grandmother, GreatNan, smiling down at newborn Bathsheba.; I sang to babies and the babies sang to me.; Seven months later we went to Maisons Laffitte, France, again for a two-year stint. These memories make me laugh: on impulse, seeing a tall woman with two old dogs and a funny purple hat walking home with her daughter, parallel to us, I told Chloe to run over and invite them to her birthday tea party. Turned out she was from Colorado. We ran out of glasses at the party, so by the time we went onto beer, we were drinking it out of a kiddies’ plastic tea set. Janet went to find a wine glass. She looked inside at my tip of a house. There was a hoover by the door. ‘Is that an art installation?’ she asked. I knew then that she was going to be my friend. Her husband David turned up with six bottles of wine so we carried on deep into the night. They went home forgetting to take their dogs Crow and Boingo with them. We phoned them in the morning and said ‘Did you forget anything?’; Janet is sometimes a great help. In a fit of doubt I asked her if I should take the leap and adopt two ponies from the riding school which was closing down. She chuckled: ‘You’re asking someone who comes home with a goat in the back of the car!’; ‘And goes back and gets another goat the next day,’ added David. ‘And then those goats have babies…’; This is Janet and me visiting Penel in Strasbourg:; Another night in France Fred nearly castrated himself on a small bendy tree. He raised an old bed frame above his head to smash it for firewood but then started staggering backwards. We witnessed his face making incremental steps towards a look of serious panic before the tree eventually popped out from through his legs. The resulting impulsion knocked him over and the bed smashed anyway.; Flip flip. We brought the ponies back from their stables in France and turned them out into a meadow full of buttercups. Bash wore princess dresses for a year then, aged three nearly four wore her school uniform all summer (bleeeesss) even at Mangey Cottage in Glen Esk – she was that excited to be going to school.; I can still see my little flute pupils making their mummies weep as they played ‘Walking in the Air’ at our Christmas concerts. I started as a helper at RDA. Alfie started writing his little books.; Then my friend Arulesh’s daughter, Anjani, was killed in a car crash in Sri Lanka. This was the most awful blow. I understood because of Ferg. We cried and cried for months and months. I got Treacle for them as a dog was the only thing I thought might help. Arulesh and I walked very slowly round the fields of Dane O’Coys with the dogs and talked about life and death.; We will never forget Hockerill teacher Mr Ullman’s revelatory exchange program which sent Chloe and Tabby to Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Romania, Hungary and Rwanda. This led to funny times with exchange students from all over the world – Miyuki from Japan making origami swans at the breakfast table stands out. Miyuki brought her friends round to play ping-pong in the big room. I asked them all if they would like to go to visit the ponies. They piled into the Transit van and all started exclaiming in a mixture of horror and delight and taking photos of all the hay, head-collars, dog leads and rubbish on the floor of the van. The ponies took one look at them and their flashing devices and galloped off snorting.; We all cried when we dropped Miyuki off at the coach in the Hockerill car park at six am, because I said as I hugged her ‘See you soon, Miyuki,’ as you do. And Alfie said, ‘We won’t see her soon, Mum, because she lives on the other side of the world.’ But Ha! Next October, Alfie is going to Japan and will be able to see Miyuki. (He will have to take new pictures of the inside of the car for her, so she can see nothing has changed.) So it wasn’t soon, but it won’t be never neither. We thank Mike Ullman and his legacy for that. He died from cancer not long ago which gutted everyone.; We have picked blueberries and dived in lakes with Annika in Sweden. We bought half of a narrow boat with Barney. Alfie learnt to play some stringed instruments:; There was Allycats, Operatics, Young Actors Company, Craft Ensemble. Arulesh gave birth to a baby boy called Anish, and later a baby girl called Ishani. Claire and I started a book group in the Half Moon pub. I started Iyengar yoga with Lorna. Fred drank with the DONS and took Alfie to football as he was goalie for the Stortford A’s. We returned to New York for Alfie’s tenth birthday to show him where he was born.; My friend Beth visited from France for an unforgettable marathon drinking sesh in the Half Moon. Through Margeret’s pottery classes we discovered Pete Lemer’s underground studio. And then there was Jammy Dodgers, the Musical, written by Chloe!; Tabby was on Eastenders as Lauren’s friend. The girls dressed up every year to go to the opera with Aunty Lindesay and Uncle Peter. I trained to be an instructor with RDA. We became roadies for Chloe’s band Pandora’s Box. We took plays to Edinburgh twice. The dogs and I started up a new Friday walking group with Phoebe, Sally, Debbie, Louise. I accompanied Chloe to Boston to study at Berklee College of Music and as we stepped out of the cab I knew it was the right place for her. Amidst these snapshots there are thousands of others, some not so good, some, of course, quite awful and scary. Each one can be clicked on to open the full story, sadly not on here, (yet!) but in my mind.; Thinking about all this mass of stuff that is my life, I see that really I have probably almost lived long enough. (You spotted the ‘really’ ‘probably’ and ‘almost’ qualifying that sentence!) You can pile a lot of excitement into 46 years. However, until a couple of years ago, I often felt overwhelmed and too busy. I wouldn’t mind having a couple of decades of calmer time to be an instructor at RDA, coach my flute pupils till I am sure they will never give up, reflect, read, drink gin with friends and wallow in Greek waters.; Oh, my, I have remembered a pivotal moment: while we were in New York, a friend of mine, Terri, turned up on my birthday with a book for me about writing. It was called ‘The Artist’s Way.’ She said ‘You said you wanted to write a book, so this will help you begin.’ I was very touched that this woman whom I didn’t even know that well was taking my desire to write more seriously than I was. Coincidentally I received in the post a book from my friend Sarah in Saffron Walden. It was called ‘The Politics of Breastfeeding.’ The two books together fuelled the creation of my book ‘A Breast of the Times‘. Writing became important.; My Aunt Lindesay just sent me a copy of a five-year-diary that Great Granny at age 39 kept from the years 1948-1953 when she was living in Ladysmith Road, Edinburgh. It starts when Lindesay was 14 and my dad 12. It is a fascinating read. Great Granny is gone, but she’s not gone, as you hear her voice and feel her spirit clear as day.; So, what am I saying? I don’t know, I’m in a state, I tell you. What is important to us in life? Education. Stopping cruelty. Making change. My sister would say revolution. Creating with a view to leaving something behind? Fundraising for important causes. Helping others. That does reduce the pain and anguish. But now others are having to help me. (I admit they always have been helping me: people felt they had to, because I had lots of babies and was messy. Thanks for that.); I am in less of a state now. Typing out my life has been therapy. Soz for being soz. Now I should just start tidying up all the mess I’ve made. I’ll tidy and Chloe will clean.; BTW Diabetes Newsflash: at Tabby’s eventual teen diabetes clinic on Thursday at Addenbrooke’s this clever-looking chap with an impossibly quiet voice told her she has been injecting double the slow-release insulin she should have been for the last three months. She’s reduced it by half on his instructions. Her blood readings have shot up though. We are trained to have ketoacidosis-fear so are WUZZED.; Exciting Newsflash: Alfie’s best mate Alex Patton has been selected for England Rugby Trials. Wowzer. We are thrilled.",0,1,0.09856380658050337
711,33,102,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"I am going for chemo today at midday. Just thought I should update quickly as a lot of things have happened.; Yesterday I went to Oncology to have blood taken. Ferdinandos walked in with a different nurse, Eileen.; ‘I have to tell you some things…’ he said ‘..as we have the results from all your scans.’; I braced myself, as you do.; ‘We don’t want you to worry but….’ he said.; Oh, hells bells. My mind flicked through all possible scenarios. Body riddled with cancer. Two weeks to live. Put affairs in order. Make a will.; ‘The CT scan showed two small nodules on the lung’ he said. ‘We don’t know what they are. They are very small, 6mm. They could be nothing.’; ‘Nodules….lung,’ I said. ‘OK.’ I realised my heart was beating fast.; ‘For this reason we do not recommend the trial. For the trial you would need completely clear scans.’; ‘It’s just protocol,’ reassured Eileen. ‘The nodules are probably nothing.’; Oh, OK, no trial then. Ferdinandos looked a bit disappointed, but still jolly handsome.; ‘Sorry,’ I said.; ‘It’s not your fault,’ he said.; ‘Could the nodules be cancer?’ I asked. You have to ask, otherwise you are annoyed later that you didn’t and you have to wait three weeks before you can ask again.; ‘They could be metastatic disease, yes,’ he agreed. ‘If they were bigger, we would put a needle in them and biopsy, but they are too small….I think it is unlikely, but we will keep them at the back of our minds.’; Poor man, having to keep lots of people’s nodules at the back of his mind all the time.; He then told me some good things: my ECG showed that my heart is fine. Nothing wrong with it. This means I can have Herceptin. Also, my bones are all fine. He also told me what the ultrasound people had already told me. That the lump has shrunk from 16mm to 11mm. I asked him if there were any other measurements. He said the only other measurement was 10mm which has not changed. Oh dear, we will have to recalculate. Funny that it has shrunk in one direction and not in the other.; We shook hands. Eileen said on the way out ‘You know, you shouldn’t worry about it. We probably all have nodules, we just don’t know about them.’; ‘Yes, thanks, that’s true,’ I smiled.; The nurses are so kind.; I am packing my remedy, my warrior, my green tea flask, a bottle of water. I am slightly wuzzed about this FEC thing, as Claire’s cousin Becky started it last Friday and says she feels worse than after her op. ‘At least then I didn’t feel ill. It was just painful which can be managed.’ She says to take the anti-sickness stuff as soon as you feel sick. She made the mistake of going to lie down to see if it passed, and then threw up for hours.; Guess who is taking me to chemo? Chloe! She is back from Boston for the summer. She has learnt to clean. I know, very odd. But she wakes up as we are going to bed and goes to bed as we are waking up.; BTW Fred has started his own blog. (It’s not normal, don’t go there.) So now both of us will sit around tapping away while Chloe cleans up lol.; Oh, all right: if you want to check out Fred’s blog the link is: Fred’s blog . It’s very helpful if you can’t get to sleep.",0,1,0.011766955266955273
712,33,103,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Susanna survived the 26 mile trek round London in the middle of the night, but it was painful. Och, the crazy loon right enough. Here is a picture of her and Emily in their bras. It is pre-walk. Apparently after the walk they did not look as bright. Yes, those are pictures of my face on the bra! This means I too power walked round London multiply while one of my selves slept.; In Susanna-the-hero’s own words: ‘7 and a half hours, non-stop, through the very cold night, dodging the drunks and the perverts, of continuous power walking to finish the 26.2miles in Hyde Park this morning at 7am.

713,33,104,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Something interesting happened at gin on Friday. Mad Lucy noticed it. It was that no one drank any gin! She is well upset. Thinks that the gin club is in jeopardy. That we might have to start calling it a ‘Ladies Club’ instead. I think this could be quite a hoot. We could even start to accept our advancing years and go for tiny glasses of sherry, such fun!; My friend Claire-who-lives-in-Ireland (not Turbo-Pimms-Claire nor Flute-Pupil-about-to-have-a-baby-that-is-light-Claire) messaged me on Facebook to say she was sad because she didn’t have a gin club. I told her that all you need is a bottle of gin and one friend. (Hell not even a friend, an acquaintance will do as they will surely be a friend by the end of the night.) ‘You make it sound so easy,’ she said. Lol. You’d think they’d have Guinness clubs aplenty in Ireland, who needs gin?; I’ve been thinking about all the activity that has gone on around this cancer thing. (And I’m not talking about the fact that if a day goes by and I don’t go out for lunch I feel hard done by.) I get appointments piling through the door for the Breast Unit, the Day Unit, Oncology, scans etc. The Breast Care Nurses phone up to tell me an appointment has changed. The trial nurse is really keen that I bring urine for her. If I compare all this to what Tabby has been offered since her Type 1 diabetes diagnosis in January it is really shocking. Absolutely nothing, is what she has had. She got out of hospital on the 26th January and she has seen nobody since, not a soul.; Most of our friends and acquaintances know what happened to Tabby, but in case you don’t know: a week after New Year Tabby took to taking a bottle of water everywhere with her as she felt so thirsty. She mentioned it to me a couple of times. The third time she said ‘I’ve been getting up four times a night to refill my water bottle. My eyes have gone blurry. I feel so, so sad for the poor African babies who don’t have anything to drink.’ I suggested she look up the symptoms of diabetes as the thirst thing kind of rang a bell. She came downstairs minutes later and said ‘Mum, I’m ticking six out of six boxes for diabetes.’; Seven thirty the next morning we were queueing at the doctor’s. At ten past nine she was seen. She said to Dr Hunukumbure: ‘I think I have diabetes. I am extremely thirsty, I wee all the time, I have no energy, I have dry skin, I have blurry vision and I’ve lost weight.’; Oops. We forgot that they really don’t like self-diagnosers. The doctor said, ‘I’m not convinced. You should drink less so you wee less, put E45 on your dry skin and go to the optician for your blurry vision.’; How interesting that a doctor wants to split up symptoms that clearly go together. The complete opposite of what a homeopath would do.; Tabby persisted: ‘I haven’t eaten anything since eight o’clock last night so can I have a blood test now?’; ‘No,’ said the doctor. ‘You can come back next week for a blood test.’; Tabby was too ill to fight and came out in tears feeling humiliated and stupid. We now know that a finger prick blood test would have taken about twenty seconds to do. Tabby now has to do it seven times a day after all.; A week later the doctor had the blood test result and called us to speak to Tabby. ‘She’s too weak to come to the phone, she’s in bed,’ I said. The day before I had had to pick her up from school for the first time ever as she felt weak and sick and could not see properly in her drama class.; ‘You should come in tomorrow and speak to the diabetes nurse as her blood glucose is very high,’ said the doctor. She did not tell us to go straight to A and E then, which was another unforgivable error.; The next day we queued again from half past seven in the morning, outside in the cold with Tabby leaning on me, pale and covered in weird spots. Saw the nurse, who was suddenly terrifyingly nice. Like, gave us her personal phone number?! Accompanied Tabby to have more blood taken with her arm around her?! She tested Tabby’s urine for ketones which were all positive. Having high blood sugar for such a long time (the thought of that extra week makes us seethe) had given her ketoacidosis of the blood, when your liver is breaking down fat due to the inability of your cells to access energy. This meant she was dangerously ill, but nobody told us that at the time. Alarm bells did start ringing when the doctor called through to the nurse’s office and spoke to me on the phone. ‘Are you going to be alright driving her to Harlow A and E?’ she asked.; I paused. Did this mean there was another option? Was she half offering me an ambulance? ‘Yes, I am’, I said finally, wondering how the hell ill was my daughter and thinking, ‘I can get her there fast, let’s not wait for an ambulance.’ The A and E people said she was so ill her organs could have shut down in which case an ambulance would have been a better option. I think the doctor did not want to make her mistake more obvious by sending her in an ambulance. Crazy, because if Tabby’s organs had shut down as I was driving her there, that would have been another dreadful mistake she would have had to live with.; Tabby was in the Trauma and Resuscitation Room for ten hours wired up to lots of machines. Doctors kept trying to get blood out of her veins but there wasn’t any. She lay there crying in shock and murmuring ‘I knew I was ill. I knew that doctor was wrong.’ She was on a ward for a whole week on two drips to restore her glucose levels to normal. She has to test her blood seven times a day and inject insulin four times a day for the rest of her life.; One thing I keep in mind all the time. Nothing that I have had to do so far with this cancer is as bad as your child being dangerously ill. I held her rag-like hand and wished and wished that I could suffer her illness for her.; The day of Tabby’s discharge, the 26th January, a diabetic specialist came to her bedside and talked for an hour, and a dietitian stopped by and explained some sheets with lists of different foods and how much insulin you would inject for each. That was the last time anyone from the system volunteered information or interest about her diabetes. We queued again at the doctor’s the week after Tabby got out of hospital to request Addenbrooke’s for clinic visits. There is a teenage diabetic clinic there and Tabby is interested in taking part in trials. A card eventually arrived with an appointment for mid-May. So, get this: the system sends you home, fresh from a two-week-long life-threatening health scare, to three and a half months, that’s sixteen weeks, of absolute vacuum where you are effectively learning on your own how to fulfill the function of your newly dead pancreas.; Elliot’s mum, who is a diabetic nurse, says that something must have gone wrong. She maintains that a diabetic specialist should be phoning Tabby up every third day to check up on her. I don’t know, but I heard on Radio 4 that there are too many new patients and too few specialists so this sort of neglect is unfortunately becoming commonplace.; Of course, when the system fails the community luckily kicks in. Kindly friends have put us in contact with long-term diabetes patients who have printed out reams of information for us. Other knowledgeable friends have run round with blood testing strips late at night and have given advice and comfort.; It’s gutting though to realise how much illness can strip us of who we are. When Tabby was but one year old she was not afraid to speak her truth. We turned up for a visit at Great Granny’s house. There was nothing Great Granny liked more than our visits, a chance to admire the babies and have wonderful lengthy conversations about Jane Austen, Latin, writing, politics. I often found visits slightly stressful, as she had jolly high standards. I had to scrub the kids up and make sure not too many heaps of rubbish fell out of the car as we arrived. Tabby was clutching her dolly. She had three dollies: Gangan Wawa (the one Gwanny gave her), Mama Wawa (the one I gave her) and Baba Wawa (the baby dolly). Today she had brought Gangan Wawa with her. We were still out on the street when Great Granny spotted the dolly and exclaimed brightly ‘Oh, and who do we have here?’; Tabby said, ‘Dat moy Gangan Wawa.’; ‘Oh, dear,’ tutted Great Granny disapprovingly, ‘That’s not a good name for a dolly! We’ll find a proper name for her. Why don’t we call her….Emily? ‘; Tabby locked eyes with Great Granny and announced very clearly, ‘DAT…MOY….GANGAN….WAWA.’; Great Granny, despite being a formidable character, knew when she was beaten and, muttering ‘Well! Some of us know our own mind!’ stepped down.; Here is a picture of Tabby when she was about two. Does it look like you can mess with her?; Interesting then that the seventeen year old Tabby knew she was very ill, yet allowed the doctor to dismiss her symptoms. She should have said to her ‘DAT…MOY….DIABETES….TAKE…BLOOD…NOW….MORON.’ The problem being, of course, that you mostly only go to the doctor when you are pretty ill. And when you are ill you don’t have the strength to stick up for yourself. She came out in tears to tell me about the E-45, the optician and having to drink less so she would wee less. Wow. You know, both of us knew it made no sense. We didn’t want a diabetes diagnosis, but we just knew it was a diabetes diagnosis. But we put up and shut up. Because part of us still believed (not any more) that after all those years of training, the doctor must know best.; So, the lesson: we have to remind ourselves all the time that we are a hugely valuable part of our own medical team. After all, only we know how we are feeling. Apparently patients who the doctors remember, the ones who make a bit of a fuss and ask lots of tricky questions, do better. We should remember that this whole diabetes/cancer thing is evolving. We can be part of new discoveries and new ways of doing things. We must keep a critical eye, keep on the ball, be proactive, research things, ask other patients. And keep hearing Simba’s daddy’s voice: ‘Remember whoooo yoooooo aaaaare!’ Don’t let the bloody illness strip you of Whooooo Yooooo Aaaaaare.; Phew, all that was quite heavy, so I’ll reward you with another daft lols story from the Tingey archives. On another visit to Great Granny’s I was carefully pouring the tea out of the beautiful tea-pot that she had brought back from China. Great Granny had nipped off to ‘visit the downstairs bathroom’. To my horror, I heard both Chloe and Tabby, aged three and one, hammering on the door of the bathroom.; ‘GWEAT GWANNY? ‘ they shouted. ‘ARE YOU DOING A WEE WEE…..OR A POO POO?’; There was a stunned silence from within. ‘Girls…girls!’ I hissed, ‘Shhh! Come here!’; ‘GWEAT GWANNY!!’ knock knock, ‘CAN YOU NOT HEAR US? ARE YOU DOING A WEE WEE….OR A POO POO?’; A faint voice came from behind the door. ‘I don’t discuss such matters.’; Eek, aaargh, big cringe. Great Granny and I both made sure we got back on the subject of Jane Austen pretty quick. Chloe and Tabby sadly never found out if it was a wee wee….or a poo poo.; At a lovely supper last night at Nellen’s I met up with a friend, Colleen. She loves the blog. She said that once we get to forty five we have an advantage over the youf as we are not afraid to ‘tell it as it is.’ I didn’t really realise that I was ‘telling it as it is.’ But now I know and it kind of makes sense. And though Great Granny would maybe not approve of me choosing the stories above over all other possible stories, she was a writer all her life, she absolutely loved high drama and a good story and I think she would have approved of the general attempt to tell things as they are.",0,1,0.07385194717708145
714,33,105,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"I visited the Breast Unit this afternoon. It was for an ultrasound progress check as I am almost halfway through chemo (I have had three lots out of six, for eight weeks out of eighteen) to see what is going on with the lump.; A trainee first asked me where I thought the lump was. I showed her and she managed to locate it on the screen. She had a little look around. Then the doctor took measurements. She said they would send the report to the oncologist. I said the lump used to be 16mm, but that I was only given one measurement. She said now the largest measurement they could find was 11mm.; This is good. It means the chemo has been doing things. But a difference of 4mm! Blimey. For all this effort. You can see why people use battle imagery in describing their dealings with cancer. I’ve been on the chemo for eight weeks. Two weeks needed to shrink each millimeter then. Slow going in anyone’s book: think squelchy, swampy ground, thorny thickets and plagues of locusts.; Thought about it all the way home. Had almost got my head round it. Told Fred about it. He unfortunately sent all my calculations haywire by telling me I needed to cube the millimeters. Aargh, panic, three-d shapes. No, said Fred, this is good. My progress is apparently much more than I thought as I was wrongly thinking linearly rather than in terms of volume. What are you expected to do if you are only ever given one measurement though?; Fred took it upon himself to be my teacher. He grabbed an orange, a lime and two jugs (lol not intended). The orange was not that much bigger than the lime in diameter. We had to watch how much the water rose up the jugs when he put the orange in one and the lime in the other. The orange made the water rise twice as much as the lime if not more. Fred was trying to show me that, given the change in measurement, the tumour has probably, depending on its shape which remains an unknown, more than halved in volume. I think. I can never be sure with maths and find my eyes glaze over easily.; Fattipus was very interested though as he is a scientist. His real name is Lucifer Archimedes Benjifluffles Fattipus. Bash called him Lucifer as she had found it in some Disney movie, Fred called him Archimedes as he had an obsession with the kitchen tap, Ben of the snailmail postcard called him Benjifluffles (I know, how come Ben gets to name the cat?) and I called him Fattipus, as he truly was one.; Fred kept saying that the lime was three quarters of the size of the orange. ‘Hang about’ I objected, ’11mm is not three quarters of 16mm.’ See, I can do elementary stuff.; ‘No, but it very nearly is,’ said Fred.; Hunh! He wants to pretend my lump is 12mm instead of 11! He means to ignore that hard won millimeter that took me a whole two weeks to shrink? Cheek of it.; We then decided that the lime’s shape was warping our calculations. Found an olive and a blueberry that better suggested the ratio we wanted.; My maths insecurity stems from sitting next to cute, high-flying twins Jill and Pippa when I was seven. After one week at school, they were on problem number 1867. I was on problem 6. That was it really. Staring in defeat at their bulky notepads bursting with neat figures I knew I was destined for the slush-pile. I mean, how could you ever hope to catch up? The only option was to keep struggling onwards, six problems per week, while they steamed ahead and disappeared over the horizon.; It is fantastic that some pupils are seriously motivated. No one should set out to pop their bubble but something really should be done to stop high achievers from annoying people who are crap at maths. Thinking about it, simply being put in sets would have helped. Or maybe the Jills and Pippas of this world should just go to uni a decade early and let us plodders be. They must have really enjoyed maths to spend such vast amounts of time doing it at home. And it all resulted in them becoming brilliant doctors. I just went home from school and sat dreaming in the lilac bush or swung on the rope and read pony books.; It did mean I made a friend for life though. The maths results list was put up on the wall every week. The first week Hester was at the bottom, Darylle second bottom. The second week, Darylle bottom, Hester second bottom and so on. The class would cluster round the list to squeal and mutter names. There was a sad inevitability about it over which Darylle and I eventually laughed and bonded. We found that we had read more pony books than anyone else for which we awarded ourselves secret A*s. I now appreciate that these early lessons in the necessity of remaining upbeat in the face of weekly humiliation developed my understanding of humour as a massive source of relief.; Must just say, I am still friends with Jill and Pippa whom I love dearly and have forgiven for unwittingly denting my self-esteem. They would probably say that I dented theirs, anyway. We have shared big lols. And to me, big lols will always be more important than maths.",0,1,0.1155721393034826
715,33,106,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Fred says never use the same joke twice. I think he’s wrong. And a hypocrite, as he’s forever telling the one he made up about the shoes you can eat. (A pear, I know, awful.) Laurel and Hardy use the same jokes zillions of times. All comedians do, otherwise they’d run out.; Also, I happen to know, as do all her friends and acquaintances, that Tabby’s Bank of Awful Faces has as yet been far from exploited. We know because we have had to suffer those faces since the day she was born. Might as well make the most of them now that we have found a use for them. She started young you know. We have no photos of her as a baby that do not have ‘the grin’ in them.; With this in mind, I will tell you about the sad fate of Gwanny’s tapioca pudding. She was given the recipe by a very old Chinese lady who told her to stir coconut milk into it. Gwanny thinks it has healing powers, so on the scan day she sent me off with a jar of it for our supper. Really asking for it, she is, as she knows we all loathe it with a passion.; The consistency is gloopy but you can still make out each individual sperm. Honestly, you couldn’t create something more revolting if you tried. So, here we go:",0,-1,-0.05800000000000001
716,33,107,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"The update on Mad Lucy is that she made it to gin on Friday evening. Unbelievable. She thinks the anaesthetic has really improved since thirteen years ago, when she woke up, chundered everywhah and was groggy for hours. This time she woke up, the anaesthetist said ‘Alright?’ and she said ‘Hmm? Yes, absolutely fine, thanks’ chipper as anything. She didn’t sleep much that first night and was a bit wiped out, but the boobs look wonderful. They used superglue instead of stitches. She showed us. The scars are already tiny. There is no mess, no bruising. The surgeons are very good at it. And my warrior was fantastic.; I am interested in all this because I am starting to have minor op anxiety. This stems from the last op I had which was to remove a cyst from an ovary. It took place in New York. I was 22 weeks pregnant with Alfie. After the op they gave me my own morphine dispenser and I held off as much as possible as I did not want to affect Little Baby Alf’s brain. (I think that was a vain hope as Little Baby Alf’s brain turned out very strange, just like his father’s.) The pain then clamped me up so much it put me into labour and resulted in a big kerfuffle, because when I came round from the op I could not speak, so I kept pressing the intercom button and saying nothing. The nurse’s voice came over saying ‘Mrs Tingey, if you have nothing to say, please stop pressing your button.’ Eventually I managed to sign to a passing male nurse that I wanted to use a pen and I wrote ‘I am in labour. I am not meant to be in labour. Help.’; They gave me magnesium to stop labour but I was allergic to it and started to blow up like Violet Beauregard. Didn’t go purple though. Fred found me in Labour and Delivery (worrying enough) surrounded by doctors shouting, injecting and panicking with machines bleeping and flashing.; All was well in the end apart maybe from Baby Alf’s brain, but I can’t help associating ops with panic stations and pain. Mad Lucy’s experience is therefore encouraging. I had expected her to be moaning and groaning, covered in blood and bruises, definitely not up for gin, but there she was stripping off and showing us her boobies.; On Thursday I had to go for two scans. The Department of Nuclear Medicine is surprisingly normal and cheery. The waiting room has pictures, kids’ toys, photos with names of all the staff smiling down from the wall. For the bone scan you walk into a tiny room. The radioactive material is in a container the size of a jar of mustard behind an orange-tinted screen. The syringe which the material goes into is held in a metal container. Two nurses check who you are and check the amount and name of the substance. Your arm goes on a pillow, the needle goes in, some blood gets sucked out then pushed in again, then the stuff gets injected. They tell you to come back in three hours, to try to drink a litre of fluid during that time, and to wee a lot as you want only your bones taking up the radioactive material, not your tissue.; I bought an innocent smoothie and sat in the WRVS cafe. Imagined that I was pulsating with radioactivity. I beamed and gleamed at people. I wrote a long letter, read a newspaper, had a cup of tea. I had only used up half an hour. I people-watched for another half hour. Drank a bottle of water. The caff got more crowded so I left and had a little walk. Then I discovered two computers and went on Facebook for a bit, drinking all the time. Chatted to my sister and my friend Levi online. Made them LOL as I said I was avoiding anyone who could possibly be pregnant, even fat men. People-watched again. Marvelled at the varieties of human. Finally, it was time for the scan. I was awash with fluid.; This chap takes you off from the waiting room. He waits while you go into the loo, as you have to have an empty bladder. The only thing in the scanning room is a huge smooth contoured machine and a chair to put your bag on. You keep your clothes on and lie down on a stretcher type thing. It rises up in the air and moves forward. The chap asks you to wriggle back a bit. ‘Don’t want to chop off your feet.’ (He means on the pictures.) A flat paving slab thing approaches your nose. It really does not look as if it is going to stop. Millimetres from your nose when you’re about to do a James Bond and duck out of there, it does stop. The chap tucks your arms in on little plastic platforms. ‘Just lie still, breathe normally, it will take fifteen minutes,’ he says.; I lie there. It’s quite dark with the thing above my nose. I realise it is moving very slowly down my body. I shut my eyes and think about my flute pupil Claire who is about to have her baby. I am just imagining that the baby has been born and Claire is passing her or him to me to hold. I delightedly take the baby into my arms and bam! I am suddenly bathed in light behind my shut eyes. I open them and see that the platform has moved down enough to stop obstructing the light. Must remember to tell Claire that her baby is Light.; After the scan I went back to the park and ride and drove to Gwanny’s. She doesn’t care about the radiation. She fed me with colli cheese. Mmmm have missed cheese. She then fed me tapioca. I know, she’s crazy. No one in this world eats tapioca. Grampa came back. He’d been doing the ponies, kind Grampa. We then chatted to Chloe in Boston on Skype.; I left at five forty five, parked in the multi-storey at the hospital and went to the CT department. The receptionist poured me a drink and asked if I wanted blackcurrant or lemon. Lemon, I said. She gave it to me. ‘Sorry,’ I said, ‘this is not lemon, it’s aniseed.’; ‘I’ll add more lemon,’ she said.; She didn’t understand. Aniseed is the one thing in the world I can’t have due to an overenthusiastic encounter with Ouzo in my youth. Oh god. I had to drink it. The whole glass. It made me want to make a massive vomcano right there in the middle of the floor.; After half an hour I had to drink another whole glass. I never wanted to drink again. The only good thing about the wait was that I spotted an ad for Spamalot’s tour at the Corn Exchange next week and I’ve been wanting to go with Alfie for ages.; Half an hour later the CT woman laid me down on another moving stretcher. ‘We’ll inject you with dye’ she said. ‘You’ll feel a hot flush and as if you need to go to the loo.’; This was an understatement. I felt a hot WHOOOOSH and as if I had gone to the loo. (I hadn’t thank god.); The CT scanner is a big cylinder. Your body moves slowly through it. You register dark and light streaks flitting round and round the inner bit of the cylinder. They tell you to ‘breathe in and hold……and breathe out’, several times. How funny that I had a CT scan thirty years ago when the whole thing was in its infancy, yet it still feels like sci-fi even now; it’s certainly never become a routine event.; I was the last person to be done. All was deserted when I got out of there at eight. Drove home still wanting to throw up but marvelling that human life is valued so highly. That my life is deemed worthy of such technological expertise. I marvelled at the NHS and how it still manages to exist. When I am marvelling at things really hard, I forget to put the radio on. I forgot to put the radio on until I was coming off the M11! That is some marvelling.; I went straight down the Half Moon as Susanna and Ben and friends were doing a fundraiser, Ben for a charity for the disabled, and Susanna for Breast Cancer. It was serious entertainment with zillions of guest artists including Tabby and Bashi, and hilarious intricate mash-ups of different songs. Susanna is doing the Moonwalk on the 12th May, ie walking 26 miles through London during the night in a decorated bra, because of me! (Och, the crazy loon.) She is raising funds for breast cancer research. Just in case anyone would like to swell the coffers by a few quid, the page is:; http://www.walkthewalkfundraising.org/hero_pages/view_posts/Susanna_Cork; Today we went to Roydon to christen Big Alf’s boat. The boat is ‘Irene Jean’ after Fred’s mum. Fred drank quite a lot of champagne. On the way home I offered to drop him off at the beer festival in Green Tye. ‘Oh no’, he said, ‘we’re not going til eight.’; ‘Who are you going with?’ I asked.; ‘Well…’… pause…’Colin….’ he said.; ‘Colin….is dead,’ I said.; ‘Oh yeah, you’re right,’ said Fred.; ‘Could drop you off whenever then,’ I said. ‘Colin won’t mind when you turn up. He’s probably there already.’; Colin died suddenly of pneumonia at Christmas. He was part of the drinking group known as the DONS, the Dads of Northgate School. He was so inextricably linked with the beer festival that I understand Fred cannot envisage one without the other. Colin knew all the history and landmarks of the area, most useful for the stagger home across the fields in the dark.; People keep asking how Fred is and I always say ‘Fine!’ like why would he not be fine? But now I’m not so sure. Anyway, he’s gone to the festival now and I know Gary’s there so Fred won’t look really daft all on his loz talking to Colin. I suspect only Colin knows the way home through the dark fields, so I’m hoping he is there tonight.",0,1,0.06483746484658891
717,33,108,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"This is the first day of returning to relative normality from an altered state. I curled up and refused to blog during those few poisoned days, but I have to get back on it as I apparently have some bladdicts who don’t like it if I don’t keep them informed as to what’s going on.; Well, if you really want to know, I have been quite feeble. Dyspraxic even. I emptied the dishwasher and dropped the cups. Bash wanted me to sign a form and I scrawled a wobbly line. My legs have been collapsing from under me every time I get up. Yesterday Fred came home and I was in bed. He felt my hand and realised I was burning up. We got on the case straight away, with remedy, codeine and curry. It worked.; Newsflash: Mad Lucy is going for her op today. Those PIP implants will come out and new ones will go in. Nerve-racking in no small way. Only realised this earlier today, so went into a bit of a tizz. Went round bearing gifts. She was out down the town. Typical, shopping in the face of trauma. She turned up. I offered Arnica (she had some already and has already taken some), Rescue Remedy Pastilles to suck after the event, and my Warrior. I felt quite emotional handing him over tied up to his lace. He is going off without me on a new adventure. Mad Lucy beamed with delight and assured me she won’t lose him, she will tie him on somewhere. I also took the FAKE flowers, as they are the only ones to have survived the long haul, and I know that Mattie won’t mind: she will be pleased Mad Lucy has them.; While I was there, my phone went and I realised I had forgotten all about a College Mums’ Baroosh cocktail lunch. Ooh, I don’t know, this social whirl. Zoomed down there on my bike and met up with old friends. They had not seen me properly for more than a year so we had a lot to catch up on. Before my crab and avocado salad I had two large Mojitos, (mmm, must try these at home, although I do recall trying them out on Barney’s boat once and all ending up sploshing about in the water with no clothes on), so it all became a bit of a daze but do recall us coming to the conclusion that if the trial drug causes the rare dreaded necrosis of the jaw, (basically a hole in your jaw that does not heal), I can always use it (the hole) for a constant infusion of Mojito. Which would be one proactive way to deal with your troubles.; One of the mums at the lunch has a husband who is a surgeon and she sure knows lots of interesting things. For example, if you ever see the letters P.I.T.A. on the front of your notes, you might assume it means something very technical but, no: it is a warning to other doctors that you are a Pain In The Ass. I could tell you some of the other things she told us if I could remember them, but then I’d have to kill you, or she’d have to kill me or nuffin or sumfin. Anyway, we had a jolly old laugh.; My friends insisted on paying for lunch, even though I said that made me more of a cancer patient. Wobbled up the hill on the bike with their huge bunch of flowers catching in the wheel. I had tried to contact my flute pupils but unfortunately the cocktail lunch meant I had left them stranded at the door being yapped at and thinking I had died of chemo poisoning. Texted to let them know I was alive. They have forgiven me.; People and animals are surprisingly accepting of changed states. Katze, Kitze and Fattipus of course love the fact that I am more supine these days, taking advantage accordingly. Yesterday I told the dogs it was time for their walk so we all trundled upstairs to find socks and boots. I crawled under the duvet just to warm up really and was still there three hours later. The dogs just put their heads on their paws. My pupils have played duets this week sitting with me on the kitchen bench with the music propped up on the pepper pot. If they notice a change, they don’t seem to mind.; Driving back from the ponies yesterday my mouth felt painful and odd. I stuck my tongue out at myself in the mirror and nearly lost control of my wheel. The tongue looked as if it had been slathered with a mildewed tahini paste. It looked like an inner Triffid was extending a feeler out of my throat. Good Lord, detox quick. One of my pupils says her father-in-law (a three-time cancer survivor) used to come back from chemo and stand in the shower for hours at a time, drinking and weeing. You’ve got to wash it off you and out of you. Went shopping for more miso, vegetables, rice noodles. My friend Jon who is painting the windows brought some enormous spinach leaves over from his garden. Nellen dropped by with fresh turmeric root and parsley. I have two pineapples to juice. God, it’s a bit tiring though all this. I feel like I could just give up and have a nice bowl of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. And then a Crunchie. And some of them big Buttons.; Barney turned up, quite shaken, as a lorry had cut in on him from the inside lane on the M11 and had bashed the front of his car in without even realising it. Braking had no effect on the wet road. I took him cups of Earl Grey with goat’s milk (he did look a tad disappointed) out in the courtyard as he replaced the radiator and bonnet with new bits that he got for sixty quid from a scrap yard. Looking at the poor crushed open front, I was reminded of the poem that Uncle Bob in Canada’s friend, Stu Harvey wrote for me. The ill person is compared to a bashed up car and the dubious treatment of the illness to a broken hoist at the garage.; ‘Well,’ said Barn, ‘all she needs really is a bit of tweaking and couple of new headlamps.’; You’re telling me she does!; These are the old headlamps.; These are the new headlamps. Phew. Much better. Let’s hope Mad Lucy’s new ones are half as good.; Thinking about the radioactive bone scan tomorrow and the trial in general, I have remembered that it won’t be my first experience of being a guinea-pig. My sister and I were about four and six when my brother Pete decided to see if his rope pulley for transporting things into and out of the treehouse would extend to human cargo. We still remember climbing with trepidation into the crate, the jolting of the stiff ropes, the sudden swing of our box as it slipped off its platform to hang in the air. We remember the shout as my brother realised that together we must have weighed more than whatever he was using as a counterweight (himself probably), the snapping of twigs, the rush of the ground towards us. We thought it was funny and were shaken but not dead.; I’m thinking of Mad Lucy in hospital now having it done. Am glad the Warrior is watching over her.",0,1,0.051159443901379394

Grampa picked me up from the station, took me to the day unit, got me more tea, passed me my water bottles, checked the maths. Our chemo nurse today was Jessica. She was lovely and very together. She tutted over the vein we used last time, as it experienced a bit of leakage into the tisssue, was itchy and red about a week after the chemo and is now discoloured. She chose a new one nearer the thumb.; The lady next to me was called Heather. She has a pic line fitted in her upper arm, as she has to have chemo every week and would soon run out of veins. Her breast cancer has come back after eleven years and has metastasized to bones, liver and lungs. She’s good at saying that word, metastasized. The trick is to put the stress on the first ‘tas’, the second syllable. The symptom which led to the discovery of her cancer in the bones was backache. She was full of cheer and stoicism though. She used to be a midwife. We talked about home births, water births. Her daughter is eighteen and is called Chloe like my Chloe. Her son Harry was picking her up. He is twenty one. We said we would meet again in three weeks. Same time, same place.; The lady on the other side had breast cancer too. She has just finished three sessions of FEC and had her first Docetaxel today. I was able to suggest a few things that I have learnt so far as she has heard of the dreaded aches. I told her to have some codeine in ahead of time, maybe to see a homeopath to find her constitutional remedy and to take B vitamins (recommended by other patients on the Macmillan blogging site). In turn she told me that the FEC caused her to feel very sick for the first five days, but for the second cycle the doctors prescribed some very good anti-sickness pills which worked. I’m going to aim to have them ready for my first cycle and be done with it. Who wants to be chundering everywhah making little vomcanos all over the place for five days? Not me.; The trial nurse, Cat, came by to fill in more answers on the forms and pick up a urine sample from me as they have to check I’m not pregnant and other things. That would be really sad. Toxic radioactive baby. Poor thing. And at my age, we would have to pretend it was Chloe’s. I was impressed as Cat told me she looked up Carcinosen last night online as she was interested in what I had said about it. I told her she might end up a homeopath lol. I asked her how many people are on the trial. Get this: I am only the third person at Addenbrooke’s to go on it. This is a surprise to me. I had imagined I was number six hundred and seventy eight or something.; Facebook comments on the radioactive bone scan stuff have prompted ideas for a wicked story, some of the details courtesy of fb friend Catherine Barry.

Nor a sultry walk. The fifteen models danced onto the catwalk in dresses by Mariposa Formal Wear. They were radiant, exuding bounce and delight. You could just tell that they had all got past that place where you care about what people think of you. They couldn’t give a damn about the small stuff. They had each chosen a favourite song to come in on. All of them have been through mastectomies, lumpectomies, chemo or radio. I absolutely loved it and clapped till my hands fell off. Smiled and laughed till my cheeks ached. And found that along with most of the audience I was crying my eyes out. Our friend Gill was beautiful in purple:; Then the men came out, modelling wondrous gladrags. I’m not sure anyone was expecting that. They too were laughing and dancing, confidently twirling the ladies. Some had done fundraising walks in Peru and China and are preparing for an Everest Base Camp expedition and a coast to coast Cuba trek. A young lad modelling a nifty suit did a back flip. The commentator joked about him being fresh from Paris and Milan.; The ball of energy behind the whole thing, Ashraf Patel, dressed in long sharply cut pale golden tails, rocked up the catwalk. There was huge applause for this incredible surgeon and fundraiser. Apparently he dedicates his whole life to the cause.; All the models then came out together. The two at the front waltzed to the end of the catwalk, looked at each other, grabbed their wigs and chucked them into the crowd, fuelling the the increasingly raucous atmosphere.; The FAB team have created a book out of the event called Life is FAB and were launching it there and then. Print and broadcast journalist Wendy Pike, ‘finding tales from real life more fascinating than fiction’ did the writing for it, helping the volunteers and models to share their ideas. The FAB lead stylist Anita Gray explains her involvement: after visiting a friend who had had surgery for breast cancer ‘It struck me that chemo-induced hair loss and breast surgery must add up to one of the lowest points for any woman’s self-image. Being a stylist and colour consultant I felt that I had a lot to offer ladies facing the same situation.’ The monthly meetings include Reiki, Reflexology and free professional beauty treatments. Her description of the way it works reminds me that again, so much revolves around the need for informal communication: ‘Often queries come up that ladies haven’t felt able to ask during medical appointments. We can ask the experts and pass on the information informally in relaxed surroundings.’; (Maybe I could ask them to explain homeopathy to Ferdinandos for me. Although my friend Pete has rightly pointed out that in Ferdinandos’ eyes, the remedy is diluted to a point past where he would consider it to contain active ingredients, so the next time he asks ‘but what’s intilt’, I can legitimately say ‘water’.); The way the meetings work can be seen too in Ashraf’s long quote from a patient’s daughter in his foreword. Loving the way he trusts this girl to say it all better than he could. The girl says ‘I went along to a meeting with my Mum who has breast cancer and within minutes of being there, the women were roaring with laughter at every opportunity.’ This is it, you see. Roaring with laughter is key: it facilitates exchange of information, because laughter is infectious and relaxes people. ‘These women are not feeling sorry for themselves,’ the girl notes, as they have ‘an inspirational determination not to let cancer get in the way of glamour and living.’; I would probably have put ‘living’ ahead of ‘glamour’ there, but you get the gist!; Each model has their photo in the book, with their comments on what they have learnt, how they got through it. I love what Carmel, the photographer, has to say. Despite choosing not to have reconstruction, it is her beautifully gowned breast gracing the front of the book. ‘I am fascinated and appalled with women’s obsession with reconstruction. It’s not something I’d ever do. It’s indicative of a society that is so obsessed with breasts. The only people who will see me one-breasted are medical staff or people who love me. I don’t want to give one minute of my life to a hospital for something which is just a society pressure.’; Bloody good points there, Carmel. I am thinking on it. (And btw thanks for saying I can use the photos.); Later one of the models, Sam, came up to me. ‘I’ve been feeling so drawn to you all night!’ she exclaimed. ‘Just had to come up and say hello. Loving your hair/hat combo.’; She’s been through breast cancer and is out the other side. She so much wanted to know about what was happening to me that I mentioned the blog. I wrote down on a scrap of paper ‘Hester Tingey The Breast Blog in the World.’; This led to one big wowzer moment. ‘OMG I don’t believe this’ she cried, once she had managed to focus on the name, being more than a bit tipsy. (Give us a break, who wasn’t by this time what with the free champers?) ‘You are Hester?! Incredible. I’ve been trying to write you a card all week! My son Brandon is best friends with your Alfie! Love Alfie! What an absolute charmer! Do you know, he was the first lad from Hockerill to come round our house after we moved in.’; I am always chuffed when people spot the charmer in Alfie as he doesn’t tend to flaunt it much at home. Two friends had mentioned Brandon’s mum to me and the fact we should get together but it just had not happened. Got so excited we did, I nearly missed the cab ride home. This is Sam’s picture from the book: lovely to meet you, Sam!; (BTW in case anyone wants a copy, the address given on the back of the book is Fabulous and Beautiful, Breast Clinical Trials Office, Birchwood House, St Margaret’s Hospital, Epping CM16 6TN.)",0,1,0.1982139886257533
721,33,111,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Despite Oncology being packed full of ill peeps, I didn’t have to wait at all. Straight after bloods, I was put in a room and the Thessalonikian walked in with two nurses. I was so happy. My friend! He wasn’t too chatty today though.; ‘How have you been reacting to the chemo?’ he asked.; ‘Well, the first time I had aches and pains, then sore feet for the first few days. The second time I had flu-like shivering and aches but managed to make the symptoms go away with a homeopathic remedy.’; His eyebrows went up.; ‘That’s OK, isn’t it? To take a remedy I mean?’ I asked.; ‘I don’t know what it is. What is the name of it?’; ‘It’s called Carcinosen?’; ‘I do not know what is in it. If I don’t know what is in it, I cannot tell you if it is OK.’; ‘Well, it’s made of cancer, funnily enough.’; ‘Yes, but I do not know what it is made of.’; ‘It’s made of human cancer.’; ‘I do not know how it is made, or what things have gone into the production of this, so I cannot tell you, really.’; Hmm. I was flummoxed. Being always aware of the packed waiting room outside, we moved on.; Reminds me of a story Peggy used to tell. Queen Victoria used to walk around the estate of Balmoral Castle and go in to the workers’ cottages and sit down and talk with them. One time a Scotch Broth was bubbling away on the stove. The Queen asked what was in the Broth.; The peasant scratched his head and said ‘Well, there’s onion intilt, and there’s mutton intilt, and there’re tatties intilt and there’s….’; Queen Victoria interrupted him: ‘But what’s ‘intilt’?; ‘Well, there’s butter intilt, and there’s parsnip intilt and there’s turnip intilt and there’s…’; The Queen interrupted again: ‘But I don’t understand: what’s ‘intilt‘?; ‘Well, there’s carrot intilt and there’s barley intilt and there’s leek intilt….’; ‘But what’s ‘intilt‘, man, what’s ‘intilt’?‘ shouted the Queen in frustration.; I think the story just carries on in the same vein ad infinitum, ‘Well, there’s chives intilt and there’s parsley intilt and….’ but if any cousins remember a punchline, please add it in the comments.; It was a bit like that talking to the Thessalonikian. BTDubs! I have found out his name! You’ll never guess: go on, TRY. No, you really never will. It’s FERDINANDOS. Isn’t that rather magnificent?; We had to fill in around ten sheets of info for the trial. And then almost the whole of me had to be examined. Ankles, abdomen, neck, skull, face, eyes, ears, teeth. He tested reflexes, listened to heart, shone his torch up my nose (I know, bizarre), made me focus on his nose while waggling his fingers in my peripheral vision.; ‘Yes, I can see them wiggle…..I see them! I see them wiggle…..I see them wiggle.’ I scored high on that one, I know I did.; During all this the nurses stood present, averting their eyes, looking at the wall. I had to press his arm down, then out, then up. Whenever the sheet that you are meant to clutch around your boobs fell down due to me having to use both arms for a task, the sweet nurse (she’s called Cat) pushed my pile of clothes a bit nearer. But it’s not like you can hurriedly shove on your clothes in the middle of such seriousness. That would just add to the awkwardness. Truth is, you get to be past embarrassment really. You have to know that medical people don’t see bodies in the way that we do. They are looking inside at all the blood and guts. And once someone has seen and felt your boobs, does it really matter how many times they see and feel them?; I get a certain amount of satisfaction from thinking ‘Hehe, Ferdinandos, you are BLOG FODDER and you do not know it lol.’; You can get dressed for the ticking of the boxes. He ticked normal on quite a few, I am happy to report. I really deserved an A* for the wiggling fingers test but only got a normal.; I asked for the results of the MRI. Boob number two is totally alright. That’s good. I asked for results of the ECG but they’re not back yet. I asked them all if they thought the trial was a good thing, (for me, not for the world). Yes, they all thought it would be beneficial for me. One benefit I have already seen is that the trial nurse booked today’s nine o’clock appointment for me, as I forgot to do it on the way out last time. They’re on the case.; Despite having had blood taken already, had to have more taken for the trial. Other arm. While I was waiting, I chatted to a couple coming every day from Peterborough for the chap to have his chemo. They end up waiting for hours, so I found them the leaflet for the Mary Wallace Centre where you can hang out and the chemo people will ring through to tell you it’s time.; On another note, have received two answers (both on postcards) to the question ‘What are tits for?’ One rather clever anonymous diagram portrays protruding tits left with an equally protruding bum right, with the answer ‘a counterbalance!‘ ANON, you score B+ as you can’t draw faces to save your life, but well spotted.; Another has its title at the top: TITS AND TEETH.; This line at the bottom reads: AND YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE EYEBALLS.; The other side reads:; You get the elusive A*, for profound thinking, Fiona.",0,1,0.16426313628899838
722,33,112,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Well, I had my doubts this morning upon looking into the pan. The nettles had turned into a horribly dark green wodge floating in a greasy pool. I put it in the fridge and went out. At supper time I reheated it and beezed it up. It started to look a bit better, frothing up a lurid green. I took it off the heat, took out a hot cupful, added a spoonful of creme fraiche to the cup, stirred it around and poured this back into the soup. This is to stop the cream from curdling. I got a bit tired of this method, as you do, and just shoved in a spoonful of cream. Oh, shizzle on my dizzle, as Alfie would say, it curdled. Never mind. Ladled some into a bowl for Alfie. This is Alfie having his soup.; Don’t ask why he has the banana. We don’t know.; Then Tabby came down for her soup. This is Tabby having her soup.; Again we tried to make Tabby have some soup.; We told Alfie and Tabby that nettle soup is very very good for one. It didn’t seem to help.; Bashi wisely refused to have any soup. Following in the footsteps of Augustus Was A Chubby Lad, she cried ‘Take the nasty soup away, I won’t have nasty soup today!’; The only person who liked the soup was Fred. Here is Fred having his soup.; I hated the soup. Made me gag. Alfie accurately used two words to describe it. Disgusting was one of them. The other was a very rude qualifier.; Still, at least we tried. I wish my readers better success with their foraging.",0,-1,-0.07219806763285024
723,33,113,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"I have seen a couple of revealing ‘lists of things one should not say to people with cancer’. They are written by people with more experience than me, who have understandably heard it all before and become irritated by comments such as ‘You’ll be fine,’ ‘You’ve just got to be positive,’ and ‘if there’s anything I can do….’; Although these lists are probably helpful for carers and others to read, I totally don’t mind if people get any ‘etiquette’ slightly skewed. I would much rather people came up to me for a chat, any old chat, about treatment, hair, dogs, whatever, than hang back thinking ‘omg, I might say the wrong thing.’ I remember a few years back seeing a fellow Mum from Junior Operatics, Sally, in the street wearing a turban thing, and I did feel awkward and like I didn’t want to say hello because I might blurt out the wrong thing about her hair loss or her illness and also I felt bad because although I had heard she had cancer, I had not turned up at her house with cakes.; I can’t remember this, but Sally assures me that I ran up to her and said ‘Oh, god, Sally, has all your hair fallen out? That happened to me when I was sixteen!’; The fact that I was in possession of a shock of tangles at the time really helped her, she claims. I still feel sure that I said the wrong thing, but I am still glad I said something.; It’s the same with teaching flute. I am aiming to help my pupils become experimental, functioning players. I want them to be able to pick up any flute, any piece of music and give it a go. Better to play something than be afraid they will get it wrong. If you get too hooked on perfection in your way of learning you can get a bit blocked. Cave men and women were picking up bones in the forest and fashioning them into flutes. Who are we to impose strict rules upon this ancient pastime and claim that a piece has to be played exactly like this, again and again, the same. I say, play lots of pieces, duets, trios, different ones every day, some hard, some easy, some made up on the spot.; I have been too busy to blog, because with the absence of symptoms life scooped me up again and I forgot about the cancer for a few days. However, I rang the trial nurses early in the week to say that I would like to join the Denosumab trial. On Friday two letters arrived. The first was from the Department of Nuclear Medicine. It said that I am going to have a bone scan ‘NM bone whole body‘ on the 3rd of May, 9.30am. Pictures will be taken three hours after I am injected with a ‘carefully chosen’ radioactive substance . (I know, I think I had not quite picked this up from the info sheets.) I should avoid pregnant women and children for 24 hours afterwards. I looked down the page. ‘Are nuclear medicine tests dangerous?’ Their answer is ‘No. Harmful effects are very rare.’ ‘You will receive some radiation which is comparable to some x-rays. However, to avoid unnecessary exposure to others, where possible you should minimise close contact with small children and pregnant women for the rest of the day.’; Worrying? Yes, a bit. Images of poor yellow Litvinenko swim to mind. When I told all to the gin group they laughed. Mad Lucy has spent most of her life working to seek out asbestos, so is probably horribly contaminated herself. Claire flippantly likened me to the Ready Brek kid, glowing wierdly through the gloom. But she thinks it’s fine: the radioactive stuff apparently breaks down quickly.; The other letter was from the CT department saying I was to have an abdomen/thorax scan the same day, but at 6.30 in the evening. Probably won’t be worth going home in between. I could visit Gwanny. Oops no, don’t want to contaminate her. I could drop in on someone I really don’t like. Could sit on the river bank and contaminate the ducks. Or sit in a caff and contaminate unsuspecting coffee drinkers.; Sigh. I’ll sit in the car. On my ownio. Or do yoga on a grass verge somewhere.; Anyway, anti-cancer stuff has as usual been going on. I do yoga in the ponies’ field while the dogs chase rabbits. I am eating ryvita, houmous, tomatoes and seaweed. Still making soup every day, with miso, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, etc. My friend Janet said I must make nettle soup as it is bursting with good things. So I took gardening gloves and scissors on a walk and cut the tops of fresh nettles. Don’t worry about doing this, just think, ‘little bastards, how often did you sting me when I was little?’ It’s best to find inaccessible, tall ones that won’t have been piddled on by dogs or deer.; To make the soup, first shake the ladybirds off the nettles into the hedge. The only person I knew who ate ladybirds was my brother Fergus, and it is sadly not advisable to emulate his way of life, although he definitely would have approved of nettle soup. Wash the nettles and drain them. The little bastards stung me on the thumb while I was doing this. Sizzle an onion in olive oil, with garlic if you like it, add a couple of diced potatoes and the nettles. Stir and cover with nearly boiling water. Add sea salt and pepper. Simmer gently for about twenty minutes. Beeze it up in the beezer. At the end Janet adds creme fraiche. I will try soya cream. I made the soup last night and will eat it tonight. Will post a picture later.; My cousin Kate in Paris says maybe not to go OTT with the diet, as the chap whose diet book I am trying to follow, David Servan-Schrieber, died last year. However, he first discovered his brain tumour when he was thirty one, and died aged fifty, so he did manage to hold it at bay for nearly twenty years. Without the diet he might have died after five, who knows? He thought that playing in pesticide-sprayed corn fields from the age of about two til nine gave him and his two cousins their cancers.; I have discovered a new site, called NHS predict. You type in what you’ve got, like Invasive Ductal Carcinoma or whatever, with a few details like your age and the grade of cancer, whether it’s HER2+ or not etc and they predict how likely you are to survive. Quite interesting really. With chemotherapy, hormone therapy and Herceptin in addition to surgery, ninety three percent of women with my illness should still be around after ten years. They don’t say for fifteen or twenty years.; Today I am going to a ‘Face Forward’ session at the Mary Wallace Centre. It’s to help people with issues surrounding hair loss. I have no idea what it will be like but I suspect it will be fun. Will report on this later.",0,1,0.03755522255522256

727,33,15,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Hi all, I have not written anything since my last chapter of Sally-Anne. I kind of burnt myself out, and blogging went out the window, as teaching has consumed large swathes of my time, my main new strength being in ‘verb-training’ children and adults in French, on the board, with swirling multi-coloured pens. I love doing this, and seriously love my verbs, but….it is taking me away from my writing. I find, if you don’t write, even for a few days, the ability starts to shrink, and it feels weird, alien, lost, as though it’s not going to be read, by anyone, ever.; Update on the last few months: well, despite Fred tripping over his own laces going down Bell’s Hill, and breaking his arm, in an apparent kack-handed attempt to get out of going, we went on a yoga retreat in Morocco. Fred mainly avoided the yoga and drank wine instead. He then grudgingly allowed himself a couple of gentle twists of the spine…. which instantly sorted out his long-term neck injury. Ha. It does help, see. I have been trying for many years to get him to do a bit of yoga.; I came back and joined about a million cat, greyhound, working donkey, soi dog, vegan, SPANA charity things on facebook and spend quite a lot of time ‘liking’ these and sending them money. There is even the wonderful Primrose mouse sanctuary, which you must ‘like’ immediately. The kids in the village of Tigmi had kept asking us for ‘un stylo, un stylo,’ so I sent them 200 bic biros as bic always last for ages. (Well, not in our house they don’t, as the parrots like destroying them. How can I allow that? See, I am not controlling my environment to the best of my abilities right now.); I went to Jac’s chakra-opening yoga workshop, designed to open up the lower three chakras. It was a lot of twisting and folding forward. It felt good. In the relaxation at the end I got a lot of rich purple waves going up my field of vision, slow, soft, delicious. It was like being stroked by angels. I know what that feels like, blissful, as I have experienced it, but this time it was in colour. It was great but I now feel strange and am a bit wuzzed that I opened those three and am now not in balance. Are my upper ones still shut? Am I wonky like a plane with one wing pouring smoke?; Luckily, in a couple of weeks I am going to the follow-up workshop to open up the top three, or is it four? I feel like this is the only thing which can now sort me out. But by then will the bottom three have closed up again? Will I then start spewing dark toxins from the other wing? Shit, shit, my chakras….; I have been re-reading ‘the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.’ It’s actually much better than you think it’s going to be. I thought, ‘Oh, it’ll be like, ‘get up early,’ and ‘tidy your house’, ‘don’t eat beans and egg on toast’ and stuff like that, but it’s not. It’s more ‘be proactive,’ ‘think win-win,’ ‘seek first to understand, then to be understood,’ etc. With the fabulous ‘Sharpen the Saw’ encircling all at number 7, which means, look after yourself, do yoga, eat well, so that you are a maintained instrument for progress, change, evolution.; I have thus determined to spend more time in my planning and prevention quadrant, rather than in the crisis quadrant or the losers’ tea-making and thumb-twiddling quadrants. So I have moved all my books for teaching French upstairs to the drawers of my desk, marked by days of the week on which I will need them. I stole this technique off my neighbour Sue who is very organised.; I have got up to the chapter on where we centre ourselves. Some people are money-centred, or family-centred, work-centred etc. The book seems to be arguing that all these are flawed. It claims it’s best to centre oneself on principles, like honesty, I suppose, which do not ever change so we would not be at the mercy of changing family/work/relationship/financial circumstances. Would it be OK to be centred around Nature? It’s not a principle, but…it’s a massive help. When I am wandering through the woods with the dogs and a friend if I am lucky, I feel truly me and truly happy.; I did a Hale Dwoskin exercise which made you condense what you want to do with your life into four words. I ended up with ‘Walk, Yoga, Write, Inspire.’ The ‘inspire’ is meant to contain within it all my teaching. It is hard though to get it down to four. Janet spotted that I had no mention of friends or family in there, which gave me a bit of a panic. I considered changing the big four, but couldn’t see which one I could possibly take out. Then I thought, friends and family can join me on a walk or in the yoga if they want to, even in the writing.

There was a strange silence round us.; ‘Yes.’; Nobody, not even the mozzy bitchybitch people, should be at the mercy of plakkiplaits, so I felt like it was my duty to give them truinf. ‘Plakkiplaits,…’ I said firmlon, ‘are completelon daygolass. They were in such glut six months back, and were so bangup with the lowers, in truinf, everyone is totallon ovah them. You’d have to be tasteless and massively exoshwerve to be siddering them right now.’; As I dixed these last words, the vlady next to me started softclapping her vlips. She dinti say anyting, just turned wayway. The others too had little spasms dronging on with their moufleurs and vaddervanillis. They dinti appear to be tubing any more. I looked round me. Everyone was spasming quietlon.; It seemed a bit funny, so I started vlatting. ‘Why is everyb…’ My words dried up as I turned round and caught bleppof what they had alpretta bleppaed. A vlady, sporting the most stonishing moufleur strapped up with randomlon-angled strips of plak and hung with hundreds of layered, skinny plakkiplaits in vlu, orange and gold, stood at the big glass doors into the void. She just tadarsed there, still, silent. It was Yana.; !Oh, mouthing, spitting Miley. !?What the nostrils had I done.",0,1,0.06745221898283121

This means that lugging that coffin around the streets was worth it in the end!; The funniest thing happened. Nine of my relatives came to the last performance. They all have the same surname, (also Gwanny’s maiden name): Stiven. There is a line in the show when Jem is chucked into the Deadhouse with all the dead bodies and shouts, ‘YOU CAN’T LEAVE US IN ‘ERE WITH ALL THE STIFF’UNS!’ My cousins all heard ‘YOU CAN’T LEAVE US IN ‘ERE WITH ALL THE STIVENS!’ and thought we must have planned some jape on them. There are several other not-very-polite mentions of the ‘stiff’uns’ and each time there were big guffaws from the clan. We really had no clue why people were laughing at such inappropriate places and just thought that weekend audiences must be a bit more bonkers than Monday-Friday ones, until my cousin Davy-lad told us they were a bit offended about all the Stiven jokes and how they were going to do a musical next year taking the piss out of the Tingeys!; We thanked our lovely team at SPACE venues with two crates of beer, as they were absolutely brilliant and very patient with us, considering the size of our cast and props list.; Here are some pics from the last couple of days. Megan, as well as being on keyboards, had several parts one of which was a very scary sewer rat:; This is the musicians jamming on the street:; Here’s our picnic up Arthur’s Seat. God knows where all the food is. I think we had eaten it by then.; Here are the final bows after Saturday’s sell-out performance:; And here is our goodbye final picture of the cast in their Edinburgh Jammy Dodgers Hoodies apart from Jem who doesn’t want it all to end and is still in his rags. You couldn’t have wished for a more lovely cast. They were all amazing and we are feeling the LOVE:; And here is Tabs crashed out in the van on the way home:; Ah Bleeeeeeesssss.

735,33,22,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"At our first get-in Chloe tried the red wash on the lights and the bulb blew. ‘We had a little panic-attack,’ says Fred. Now, what you don’t understand is, Fred never admits to having panic-attacks. In fact, his favourite phrase is ‘Don’t Panic,’ but he is not allowed to say that any more, as it annoys me. So this must have really given him some more grey hairs. Besides which, he bought a jumper, as he was chilly, and the lady said ‘This blue does look good on greying, older gentlemen!’ So that gave him a real panic attack, LOL.; So, our first show SOLD OUT!! In fact, people were even turned away! This is just amazing and made us very happy (and sad for the people who couldn’t get in.); The author of the original book of Jammy Dodgers Go Underground, Bowering Sivers, came all the way from Colchester to see the show yesterday. She said she thought it was ‘fantastic’. Phew! We had tried to prepare her for the fact that due to time constraints of a Fringe performance, three of her lovely characters have had to be amalgamated into one new one, but had still been worried she might hate it!; She came out on the Mile with us, leafleting. Here she is with Chloe:; We walked up Arthur’s Seat. Here is Ned with his violin, being blown away:; Here is Baby V! and Chloe:; Here is Mrs Blood and Billy:; OMG we are famous!!!! For a minute, until we realised they were some sort of camera club!; Here is Zeke putting his oboe together with the help of Lukeybabes (Thin Tim). Ooh sounds rude but isn’t! (see the unfortunately placed sand sculpture of dog in background.); Mrs Blood is BORED! BORED BORED BORED!!! She needs some MUSICIANS in her PARLOUR, MR BLOOD.; We’ve been taking the coffin to the Mile. You need a gimmick, you need something that grabs people, scares them, makes them take a leaflet. ‘Little Dead Boys in Coffins,’ I’ve been calling out. ‘Poor little boy! Look! ‘e died of ‘unger! We’re all gonna die! ‘elp us! Come to our show!’ Little boys and girls are transfixed but their parents sometimes horrified. Here are Mr and Mrs Blood with the poor dead boy:; And here are five wee lads looking at the coffin with our poor dead boy intilt: (oh my god, aren’t they gorjuss though?); We also have a review from Primary Times.; Cherries go mouldy plaguey quick. I have to wash them in the sinks of the venue loos. The watercress has gone limp and smelly. Luckily now we have Bowering Sivers’ fake watercress as I have been spending a fortune on new cherries and watercress.; All the cast have been going to see all sorts of different things. We alighted upon some great comedy in our local pub: The Debonair Assassin. He was definitely not debonair! Checked out Circa at Bristo Square with Bashi. A six-strong troupe with bendy bodies, clambering all over each other and falling from heights onto their heads. Went to see Paul Merton and his Impro chums. The best bit for me is Paul acting as interpreter for a made-up foreign language. Laughed so hard I nearly threw up. We went into a bar straight afterwards, and all the Impro Chums came in too (because we were there obv). Exciting to be hobnobbing with groovy famous peeps! Saw the gripping This is Living at the Bedlam. Luke’s exceptionally talented sister Tamsin Topolski is a dead girl in limbo. She acts so naturally that I can see her on the telly, easy. The shifts between the present deadness and the past livingness is so well done. I highly recommend it. Checked out Six a new musical. It smacked of Jason Robert-Brown, we thought, right from the first chord. Had a hard-working cast with slick moves and messages about the fractional nature of modern city life. I also went to see Darkle, with David Hayman at Surgeons’ Hall. It’s fabby. I posted an audience review for them:",0,1,0.04776887992325229
736,33,23,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"There is a song in the musical called Magical Friends. It always gives me goose-bumps, even when I am singing it to myself in the car. The lyrics were written by my friend Janet’s niece, Emily. She died from Leukaemia a year and a half ago. She was fifteen. She had a wonderful way with words and wrote lots of poetry. Before she died, she said to her mother, ‘Do something to make me famous, Mom.’ So her mum organised a wonderful ‘Inspired by Emily’ art show a year after her death. (Check out the Emily Lyman Foundation as well.) Chloe read the poetry and created a song version of The Magical Friends, using words from lots of the poems, for the art show. Later, Emily’s mum used it to make a video of snapshots of Emily’s life.; So, after the previews, many people came up to us saying, ‘That song, that song, it gave me goose-bumps and chills. It was so beautiful.’ We know that effect is from Emily. I am so glad that Emily’s work is here with us at the biggest arts festival in the world.; Gwanny came to the three-o’clock preview. Normally whenever Gwanny sees a show, especially one of ours, she says: ‘Och, I cannae hear a single wurrd! You should give out song-sheets with the wurrds on!’ This time, she didnae say it!; Besides which, even if she had said it, one should not take it personally, as Gwanny has never heard a single wurrd of any song. Apart from, as I have told you before: ‘Why can’t I be-he a teen-ager in love?’ and that was only because my brother Pete forced her to sing it so many times.; We did have fun making the Big Room into a theatre, with blacked-out windows and black sheets. Here are some pics from the dress rehearsal. (Now, you know I like my shots blurry, and they were taken on my phone, so bear with!) This is Zeke and Billy:; This is Mr and Mrs Blood:; This is Clara and the Sewer Ghost:; And here is Mrs Blood and Pa:; I had to sew Tabby into her dress. Ooh! I must be a real theatre mummy! Still need to sew in a serious hook to keep it tight at the top. Here is Mr Blood:; The Thursday evening preview was absolutely packed. All went well even the lights which had been hastily installed by Fred, a DMX box having been borrowed from our friends at the Half Moon. Our theatre guru Cath kindly came and took notes and gave us really useful feedback. Someone who saw the show phoned on Friday saying their kids had been singing the songs constantly and their piano teacher is setting up a music school and could they buy the rights to Jammy Dodgers the Musical (possibly with backing tracks!); We are now in Edinburgh. The cast are in a flat on the Meadows. Fred, Alfie and Luke arrived at two, having left at five am in the props-stuffed van, and had a two-hour hacky-sac sesh.; This is a view from the window of the lovely Secret Garden flat Fred and I are in:; It is the tech rehearsal today. Fred has gone off in the van to Glasgow to Tabby’s flat to pick up the keyboard. We are meeting at the venue at 1.15pm, in costume, with instruments and props. Excited! Better get out there to source cherries and watercress !sing it! ‘as fast as we can.’; BTW the people at Healthline.com have kindly given my blog a 2014 review: http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/best-breast-cancer-blogs#11",0,1,0.20700926677489173
737,33,24,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Oh bloody Hell. We only have two clear days until preview day. Then one day. Then we go on up. How did that happen?; It didn’t help that we held a birthday celebration for Fred yesterday, which involved a lot of Guinness, some Special Brew, (Fred’s brother Ray brought it, don’t blame me!) cider, wine, and a fire and barbeque. Mad Lucy and Claire and Jill came and giggled on Mad Lucy’s sofa, (which you’ll be glad to know has gone healthily mildewed since its pristine life at her house), while the blokes played pool.; However, progress has been made publicity-wise: we is on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jdthemusical . See if you can fathom it. I find it all a bit hashtag fucked up.; So, post Special-Brew-gathering, we were knackered and seeing double today. Rehearsals still happened: here is Chloe conducting: (OK, haven’t got the focusing knack, I’m the first to admit it but this is a good simulation of what I was seeing anyway.); It turns out Alfie can kind of act. He just feigned disinterest all these years to the point where he would ask to be taken home at the interval of every musical.; And here’s poor dead Billy. Although, you’re alright, he’s only pretending to be dead cos he’s so ‘ungry and his brothers ain’t got the ready to buy ‘im grub so….so….’e’ll just ‘ave to….DIE! (then he jumps up and wants a pork pie, don’t worry, kids, it’s a happy tale.); My to-do-list is growing apace. For starters we need to find: suit trousers for Mr Blood, hat for Mr Blood (a bowler maybe?) boots for Ned, boots for Jem who does have some but… they got zips on ’em.; Zips did not exist in Victorian times. Cath, who has trained our girls in Musical Theatre since they were six, always says this is VERY IMPORTANT. Also with a Fringe audience, the people are VERY CLOSE. They will spot the zips.; Claire, who is a sick seamstress, (sick in the modern meaning of the word, of course, ie: great,wonderful – have to define that, as Gwanny reads the blog and might think poor Claire has gone down with something and, because of the italics, is most likely on the way out) has to come round soon to alter Mrs Blood’s dress with black elastic. We need to take the Cor Anglais to WoodWind and Reed to get mended. I need to find gory bloody feet and hands (FAKE!) to stick out of the coffin. We need to stain the coffin dark. A friend (internet-phobe therefore anonymous) suggested using tea for this. Cheap and easy. We also want to source one of those drums that is a box you can sit on. We also need to watch series five and six of Breaking Bad. Addicted, you see.; Oh bollox, I haven’t even got the berries berries, sweet cherries yet, nor the juicy juicy a-a-a-apples, nor the watercress all fresh and green. Bowering Sivers tells me she found some fake watercress. Where, I wonder? We need fake, otherwise it’s going to cost us a fortune. Tomoz, after WoodWind and Reed, I’m going on the prowl around town. Maybe Wilko’s? And what’s that shop wot popped up where Woolies used to be. BQ? QD? or is it called Store 21 or something? I bet that has fake fruit and veg. Even the Pound Shop might yield something.; We need to create space for the blinkin audience. Not easy as the Big Room’s chocka full of junk. And heavy shit like mummy grand pianos. Am thinking, keep the table and seat kiddies on it. Ditto backs of sofas. Sit em on the floor. Get the kitchen benches in. Make a backstage area with a rope and curtains. Oh my god, that will block out all the light. So what are we going to do for lighting chaps? I don’t think we have even tiddlywinked over that thought.; This is like an awful lot to have to do in forty-eight hours isn’t it? Pull your fingers out team! Fred has played twenty five rounds of President and Arsehole with the cast and has come to bed pissed out his mind so I fear he won’t be shunting baby-grands at seven am. However, he did sort out the ‘can’t fit everyone in the cars with all the stuff’ problem. ‘We’ll hire a van,’ he said. Brilliant! Alfie and Luke have shotgunned riding in the front with him. Good. They can talk about stupid sums and stuff all the way up while we will be able to listen to songs from the musicals on Radio 2.; We need refreshments for the previews. Tea and coffee for the three o’clock showing. Can I be bothered to do scones and jam and cream? I would really like to but….let’s be honest, won’t get it together. Too busy raiding the supermarchés on behalf of rampant raw diabetic vegan. Then, safe choice, beer, cider, wine, juice for the seven o’clock. Get em pissed. They’re less likely to complain and more likely to enjoy! Maybe this is a good argument to serve vino at the three o’clock too….but we don’t want smashed adults losing control of their kiddiwinkies.; Oh God, Inez (Billy) apparently has to leap out of the coffin at one point. Ha, now they tell me. I had blithely assured poor José that a nailed-shut coffin would do the job just fine, but now he has to do the whole hinges thing.; To counteract all this we did our Goddess Shakti workshop. It was wonderful. My !Mowocco Fwends! Sue, Penny and Caroline were there! Lots of breathing and flowing up and down. We invoked the Goddess with chanting.; I think I got so busy I never got to tell you much about the Morocco yoga retreat in April. I went along just to humour my friend Janet. But it was the best thing ever. Came back on a high to beat all other highs. And all natural. For weeks after I bounced about with the dogs in the woods feeling like a rangy giant. My limbs felt long, strong, lean. The hinges of my body were all oiled.; The energy was zinging about in Morocco. We would meditate in the yoga room at five in the morning facing the rising sun. Air tumbled through vast arched windows. The light changed very slowly. Grey to gold. I could see the teeny bits of light zipping about, strands of it pouring into my eyes. My senses were picking up things in a new way. I felt light and strong and clear and clean and beautiful and I was LOVE pure and simple. Nothing was an effort. I could move with balance, symmetry. One morning Jac did a guided meditation with us, opening up our chakras using colours, and I started thinking about my brother Ferg, and visualising him, as he was all those years ago, and as he was when I saw him during Dennis’ incredible healing session. I could feel his presence. I could see him like he was really there. The meditation went on. It seemed like seconds were stretching in a wierd way. It was like I had cracked holding onto time. Didn’t have to squeeze, it was there in the palm of my hand. I had as much time with Ferg as I wanted. The peace was a slow-motion ocean. My fingers and toes disappeared into the air til I could no longer feel my body.; The next day, at five in the morning, we walked in a silent line up the grey mountain to meditate, and tears dripped to the dusty ground all the way up. I cried all day. Even though he died twenty-seven years ago, I felt his loss as fresh as if it were yesterday.; On the plane home, we sat next to this wonderful guru woman, who runs orphanages in India. She was a yoga teacher too and told us about meditation she does with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in classes where hundreds of people simply go into two-hour trances and zonk out. This woman seemed to have deep layers of knowledge and I wondered if she might know how and why my brother had seemed to visit me after all these years during the yoga. I mean, was I maybe managing to meet him on the astral plane, out of the constraints of time?; I asked her about it.; She looked me in the eye and said, ‘You have a pain in your heart… and you have to let him go.’; I felt like my heart was going to break. There was a battle going on in my head. I cried for the rest of the journey. With a person that you love, you don’t want to let them go. You never want to let them go. You want them to stay. I have kept him alive in me all these years because I am stubborn and determined. But that, I suppose she was trying to tell me, is an illusion and misdirected energy.; But after that, something cleared in me, and I thought maybe I had been holding on to the pain, like….unnecessarily? It’s like with Hale Dwoskin and his Learning Strategies: ‘Can you let it go? ‘ (you have to do the voice!); Should I let him go?",0,1,0.08207230329025199
738,33,25,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Oh, Lordy, Lordy. Strange shenanigans going on. Crises of motivation, shifting family dynamics, dysfunctional shizz, mood swings. However, we seem to be working through all this and be moving towards a show, of sorts!; Kieran (Fantastic Mr Blood) and Vinny (Hot Brazilian Guitarist) have moved in for the moment. Tabby’s friend from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Megan, is here too. She is a tremendous asset, playing five instruments. She also has Diabetes Type 1, like Tabby, so they can be !diabetes fwends! together. She got so excited when she first arrived that she injected masses of insulin by mistake and had to eat a hundred biccies not to have a hypo in the night.; To recap: our show, The Jammy Dodgers Go Underground goes to Edinburgh from the 11th to the 16th August 2014: 1.40pm at SPACE@Surgeon’sHall, Theatre 1. If you are going to be in Edinburgh and want to book tickets, this is the ticket page.; We are in the midst of rehearsals which will now be solid until our previews : three pm and seven pm, Thursday the 7th August 2014, our house. If you are local and would like to come, please do! Parking can be tricky in town, so leave a bit of extra time for that.; Then we have one day, for tweaking and considering (OK, let’s be honest: probably weeping and wailing and gnashing our teeth at) feedback. Then on Saturday 9th we pile all the instruments, the boots, Mrs Blood’s ladle, Zeke’s whip, the cast and the coffin (! which is being hammered together, as we speak, by my friend Quetta’s boyf José from Spain) into two cars and go on up. Just had a thought: can we fit two flutes, one sax, one french horn, several drums, three guitars, one bass, an oboe, a cor anglais, a coffin and ten people with costumes in one Peugeot 206 and one Peugeot 106? Hmm, Fred will have to set his mind to this puzzle. If you are mathematical, please consider this problem and send a postcard, with helpful diagrams.; The young lads, plus rogue girl, are going with their respective families. We pick up the keyboard from Tab’s flat in Glasgow, move into our two flats, and surely play some hackysac on the Meadows. Sunday we meet the technical team and have a two-hour tech rehearsal from one thirty. Then we will hand out leaflets for a few hours and surely play more hackysac on the Meadows, and Monday morning we’ll gather on the Royal Mile at 9.30 to persuade poor hapless tourists to come to the show, and start our show at 1.40pm.; On Wednesday morning the author of the original books, Bowering Sivers, will meet us on the Mile in her Old Ma Sivers outfit. We will sell watercress for a while, then we will go on to the venue and show her this latest bastardisation of her material! Still, she will be delighted (we hope!) that her work has inspired such creative outpouring from the youf. I would be pretty thrilled if some nutter made a musical out of my tits book, or my sperm book or my baby factory book. Although I’m pretty keen to make musicals out of them myself, as soon as I get time and a cast. If any of you wish to sign up, singers, writers, musicians, flashers, actors, donors (!of milk, sperm or babies), just send me a message.; We had an encouraging experience yesterday as one of my little flute guys called James, nine years old, came for a lesson. He is a beginner, so we played ten four-second Bs, then ten As, then ten Gs, ticking them off on a chart to keep him on the job, as he is a chatty lad. Then we heard wondrous noises emanating from the Big Room and ran in to have a look. Twenty minutes later, after seeing ‘Those Dirty Rats’ twice through, he came out, dazed with shock and joy. ‘That was the best thing I have ever seen,’ he said. ‘I just loved it more than anything.’; Ah Bleeeess. And the cast are not even in costume yet! How thrilled will he be when Zeke is prowling round in his top hat and tails and Mrs Blood is wearing her lacy red dress?; ‘You’ll have to come to the preview,’ I said. ‘Three o’clock and seven o’clock on Thursday.’; ‘I’ll come to both of them,’ he said. ‘And I’ll get here early so I can sit right at the front!’; Oh, my God, the sweetness. I nearly cried with happiness as he literally is our target audience. I had to apologise to his Mum when she picked him up, as I fear he may have caught the theatre bug (as you do) and will end up at drama school.; Now I know you are all gagging for some rehearsal pics. So……; Here is Chloe teaching Jem (Kris) the Playground Song:; And now you can see the Big Room has been turned into a rehearsal space:; And dancing is happening:; Now you probably would like to see Afie’s friend Luke trying out things from the dressing-up chest. It was after six hours of rehearsal so I think he was suffering from rehearsal fever and kind of thought he was in Hair rather than Jammy Dodgers:; You also need to see Mrs Blood practising her lift with Mr Blood:; I trawled the second-hand shops yesterday for Victorian garb. Claire from gin came too with her niece from Indonesia and her daughter Mattie. We got a whole pile of stuff! Brown skirts, gaudy high-necked shirts for Mrs Blood, a naff brooch for Mrs Blood, a suit jacket for Mr Blood, a dark blue long skirt for Clara….. all we needed was heeled black boots for Mrs Blood. Claire and I were giggling so hard about things that we sailed right past a heap of boots but Mattie called excitedly for us to come back – she had found the perfect pair! Thanks Mattie. She should hire herself out as a personal shopping consultant:; On another trip up Mill Road in Cambridge we found a top hat for Zeke and a splendiferous boater for Bowering Sivers which will top off her costume plaguey well:; So, as you can imagine, it’s all quite intense round here. This is compounded by the fact that Alfie is learning to drive, and adding him to the insurance meant I had to take myself off the insurance, so anytime I need to go anywhere he takes me, swerving about, jerking to halts, stalling at traffic lights, missing some poor van by a whisker. Stressed me out so I had to go for Pimms at Host. Mmm, mint, cucumber, ice….(never as good as our own Turbo Pimms though, eh, which will go down in history as the best drinking sesh ever…); Luckily my yoga teacher Jac is running a two hour workshop on Monday the 4th August. Can’t wait. I booked everyone on it. Tabby said ‘Can Kieran come too?’ and Chloe said ‘Can Vinny come too?’ ‘They can! Why not?! I cried merrily and booked them on it too. Jac then reminded me it is in fact a ‘Release your Inner Goddess’ workshop. LOLSVILLE!!! Never mind. She said they can still come. Whilst giggling to herself uncontrollably. Oh well. Their inner goddesses will be pleased to see the light of day. We are slightly worried that if Mr Blood comes out of the workshop a Mrs Blood then Tabby will have to play Mr Blood and all will be turned upon its head.; We have talked about understudies. Clara (Bash) is understudying Mrs Blood and Jem, so Chloe is understudying Clara, and Luke is understudying Mr Blood. Vinny is understudying Ned. It all gets rather complicated after that. Basically Chloe can understudy everyone, but only one of them at a time. And she would look a bit big for Billy.; Over the next week we are going to try to document things daily and take lots more pics which I will put on here. The musical is changing during the rehearsal process. Vinny says that’s his favourite bit, the evolution of the work. It’s because you can see what works, and how things might work better. Things work themselves out. Different people inject new ideas. We are all feeling our way. There is no such things as mistakes. ‘Mistakes’ lead to new paths, which is a good thing.; When we lived in France the girls learnt the loveliest song called ‘Petit Bonhomme de Chemin.’ I can’t remember how it went but the title means little chap of a path, and whenever I am walking the dogs I think about how dear the little windy woodland paths are. We grow so fond of them. There is magic in the way they curve around trees and how they were made by the tiny feet of rabbits, then foxes, then humans. Trudge trudge, I follow the doggies, that’s what we do, pad along on pretty, shady trails. When there are nettles coming up, Whisky stops for me to pick him up and carry him, ahhh bleeeeeeessss!; I have sent our press release to all journalists professing to be interested in children’s shows, musical theatre, listings, or theatre. I’ve prepared pics for apps, struggled again with pixels, talked to journalists, paid for ads in ThreeWeeks and FringeReview. I have also bought huge amounts of spinach and green apples and berries as Tabby is on some freaky vegan juicing thing again.; We have two apartments booked. One for most of the cast, on the Meadows, so they can go out and play hacky-sac. One on the Royal Mile, but quite far down, near a secret garden, for me and Fred. There is room for one more in that flat in case we have emergency visitors. See! We are not Fringe virgins! We know about the Emergency Visitors!! If you are an Emergency Visitor, please come and find us on the Mile. Nothing I love more than blogloons, especially those fanatics who beg me to tell them stories of Fattipuss and the Frog, or Fred, the mouse and the bollocks, or Kiki saying ‘Get a jooooob, Fred,’ : but I just stare at them blankly as I have all but forgotten the stories! Luckily though….wrote em all down! That is one sure way to defeat the loss of beautiful things.",0,1,0.17322042286440048
739,33,26,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Finally got the leaflets done. It’s always an extraordinary amount of hassle, and I’m sure I would never ever produce a show again if I had anything approximating to a good memory. But every time I forget!; I had this book when I was about four, called ‘Oh Essie!’ about a girl in Africa, who always forgot things. She forgot everything so everybody would say ‘Oh Essie!’ At school she forgot to bring her stuff and everyone said ‘Oh Essie!’ But one day she was selling oranges for her mum in the market, and she finished selling them, put the baby on her back in its sling, and went home. ‘Oh Essie!’ said her mum. ‘That is not our baby! We have our baby here. You have taken someone else’s baby.’ So poor Essie had to trawl about with the stolen baby looking for its mum. Eventually, she put the baby down and he toddled off. Essie followed him to his home. His mum was so pleased that she brought a beautiful new cloth to Essie’s school for her and told everyone at school how wonderful Essie was.; This book gave me rather a positive message about being forgetful. However, it might be better not to forget next time, but to remember that putting on a show is stressful so we remember not to do one next time. Is it good stress? Probably. Gives us something to do. But we are already spending many hours cleaning out the parrots, being on committees, chopping down the burgeoning brambles in the outdoor cage, taking cats to the vet, slug-leaping through rain-sodden wheat fields with the dogs. Not to mention Hampers and Champers dahling, a screen-writing weekend at Regent’s College, friends coming to stay on their way to Glastonbury, the Hockerill Garden Party which went with a bang and teaching, teaching, teaching. Also am writing another book about a girl called Sally-Anne who becomes a surrogate to…ooh, I’d not better give away my plot. I’ll try and get some chapters out here for you soon. I think it’s my best yet but you never know. Might be crap. It’s another black comedy, surprise surprise. There is a very funny murder in it. At least I’ve found my genre. Makes me laugh a lot. Fred helps me with the funny bits in the middle of the night. That sounds rude but so isn’t.; So, apart from all that shizz, what have I been up to? Leaflets. First things first for leaflets, you need photos! I asked Tabby if she could send through some photos of her and Kieran being Mr and Mrs Blood. ‘Mum,’ she said. ‘Mr and Mrs Blood are not the main characters. Jem, Ned and Billy are the main characters.’; ‘Ooh, yes, you’re right,’ I said. Mr and Mrs Blood are seductive but they are of course the antagonists, not the heroes.; So, photos. Fred does have a good camera but he always loses it around the house. Our house is terrible for that. Once he lost a whole cupboard full of sound equipment, adaptors, microphones and guitar leads. He lost it for nearly nine months. When he found it he said ‘Aha! There it is.’ I thought that was insanely mild. I would have done a little dance and sung Edelweiss at the top of my lungs for the rest of the day.; When Fred does occasionally come across his camera, he remembers that it has a temperamental auto-focus and thus is not worth finding. Luckily, our friend Alexandra Cameron has always said ‘Please ask if you ever need photos’ as she has been known to drape scantily-clad models around our house for the afternoon. So I did ask. She said ‘yes!’ so I texted the ‘boys.’ I say ‘boys’ as one of them is a girl! They came round, dressed up in grungy gear and smeared themselves with ash from the fireplace. They had a look at this old pic from 2007:; New Jem, Ned and Billy put themselves in front of a black sheet and got into their roles.; The next day, Alexandra sent me this:; Yes, Jem is wearing the same jacket seven years later and is holding the same lantern. Being terrible hoarders, we don’t often throw anything away, and particularly hate throwing dressing-up stuff away.; We were delighted with the pic and and sent it off to ‘Fringeprint‘ who were recommended by our venue. (When it’s not the Fringe they are known as Zed Print.) They were extremely kind to me, techno/pixel-phobe as I am. However kind they are though, there are certain things they need to create the leaflet, that I just don’t understand, pixels being one of them.; Fortunately however, I teach French to a journalist called Brian, who kindly offered to sort out the jolly old pixels and millimetres etc of my image before sending it off. The creation of the leaflet then involved long, convoluted emails on our part and patient, fast replies from Fringe Print. Then several middle-of-the-night emails pinged back and forth from Chloe in Boston. We moved through several drafts, changing most of the text, the atmosphere, the colours. Originally the image had a red glow in addition to the green, which made it too colourful: we wanted more to suggest the mouldiness and gloom of the Victorian sewers.; What we ended up with was this:; This image is going to be on small post-card-size A6 card. These are not as flimsy as the A5 paper leaflets, so won’t disintegrate so quickly in the rain. (See we are not Fringe virgins. We know about the rain.) They are also double-sided. If you are interested to see both sides, click on this: flyermaster.; We went for the Colour Printing Fringepack 1 (recommended for a show lasting one week) which means, for just £95 (special deal for SPACE people) you get 5,000 A6 full colour double-sided flyers printed on 250gsm gloss card and 50 A3 posters printed on 135gsm glossy poster paper. I copied and pasted that last bit. Could you tell? God, I know… even that amount of info makes my eyes glaze over.",0,1,0.14076544272327404
740,33,27,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"After I’d finally just about killed myself registering the show, Chloe phoned up in a bit of a tizz. ‘I can’t believe you wrote the descriptions of the show without my input!’ she exclaimed. ‘We’re meant to be a team!’; ‘I was in a hurry…and at four pm our time, you’re not even awake,’ I countered. She gets up at midday in Boston by which hour we’ve practically gone to bed.; ‘Hunh! You could have asked me a few days before,’ she answered.; This is puzzling. Like, has she been away so long she’s forgotten who her family is? Are any of us likely to get something together a few days before a deadline?; Then she said, ‘What title did you put?’; ‘Er….The Jammy Dodgers Go Underground, of course, since that is the title,’ I said.; ‘It’s too long,’ she said. ‘It should just be The Jammy Dodgers.’; ‘But…it’s the title of the book! You can’t change it. What would Brenda say?’; ‘But they might not even go underground,’ she said.; ‘What?’ I shrieked, aghast. ‘Not….Go….Underground?’; ‘Maybe not,’ she said. ‘Why should they?’; She’s very weird, you know. It’s like trying to do business with a slippery eel. ‘Er….because it’s in the title?’ I hazarded.; ‘Not if the title becomes ‘The Jammy Dodgers.’; ‘Chloe,’ I said patiently, ‘if Jem, Ned and Billy don’t Go Underground, how will they escape from the dead-house with all the nasty coffins and dead bodies in it?’; Bash and I have concluded that Chloe’s gone a bit loopy-loo. We know the plot of The Jammy Dodgers Go Underground definitely involves going underground. However, interpretation, that’s the thing with musical adaptations. Artistic licence…though we had rather too much of that the first time round in 2007. But, you know, everyone does it. Look at the Disney version of 101 Dalmations: they cut out sweet Perdita, the lost dog who helped feed the puppies! And what did Disney do to Pocahontas? And look at Spring Awakening: all those kids pulling mics out of their jacket pockets and launching into rampant anachronistic rock. Do you think Wedekind who wrote the original German play is turning in his grave? (Probably not, as he was so chillingly before his time he’s likely well chuffed.); ‘Actually, I’d better reread the book…’ Chloe conceded, ‘…as I can’t remember what bits we made up last time and what bits were really in it.’; Hmm, yes, she could read it, if our manky thumbed copy weren’t currently in Glasgow being read (out loud probably and in a sinister voice), by Mr Blood. Ooh, if I didn’t just coin a new double-barrelled epithet! ‘Manky-thumbed.’ This could well spawn a whole wave of useful others…hmm yes: ‘skanky-thumbed’ could refer to something what fell off the back of a lorry, ‘hanky-thumbed’ would refer to noses, ‘swanky-thumbed’ would be posh cars, and ‘yanky-thumbed’ would describe an obstinate nostril hair. So what would ‘wanky-thumbed’ refer to? Answers on a post-card please….",0,-1,-0.04646366003787879
741,33,28,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"For quite a few weeks, I had been putting scrawled reminders in my diary ‘REGISTER SHOW!’ You see, if you do it before five pm on Wed 19th March, you get a hundred quid discount. However, things had been hotting up around here, to say the least, with Bash in Grease the musical, the cast party (here!), the fabulous Bollywood Night at school, Bash in Little Shop of Horrors, new French pupils coming out my ears, filling in for a friend teaching au-pairs Advanced English, and filling in for another friend teaching their RDA group (as I have passed my exam and am now a proud RDA-GI).; So, inevitably and suddenly, out of the blue as it were, Wednesday 19th March was upon us. ‘Shizzle on my dizzle, I’ve got to register the show!’ I repeated to myself while making the porridge, taking the dogs to the woods, making people recite imperfect verb endings (for god’s sake it’s -AIENT fyi!). My duet partner Tracy turned up, had a cup of tea and left again without playing anything. ‘You have to register the show!’ she said. ‘You’ve only got two hours you numpty.’; I reluctantly hauled the forms up on EdFringeWare and started filling them in. How long could it possibly take? Names, addresses, contacts, name of show, number of people in show, category of show….hmm, oh yes, children’s, of course, easy. Secondary categorisation required: choose between drama, cabaret, circus, hmm… should this be comedy or musical theatre? I was in such a faff by then that I can’t remember what I put. Musical theatre I think. Oh, no, they wanted a thirty-five word description of show for programme. And a hundred-word one for the website! Shizz, shizz. I scribbled something down, Lordy knows what, but I know the Jammy Dodgers pretty well, and think I got it in some sort of nutshell, albeit a gnarly, mouldy walnut one. Then I filled in all the other screens, saving as I went along, as I am an idiot but not a total idiot. I was due to teach at half four, so I had to rush rush hurry hurry. Details of venue… typed them in. Dates of show? Monday 11th to Saturday 16th August. Time of show? Didn’t know. I phoned Charles for advice. He said since our slot at the theatre is 1.30 to 2.30, and ‘get-in’ should take ten mins, our start time should be 1.40, meaning we’ll have 45 minutes to do the show and five minutes to ‘get out’ as in, take all our stuff with us. It’s lucky Chloe is into minimalist and Brechtian as this means props are out. This is a good thing…maybe not for your props person but ours happens to be going off walking to Santiago di Compostela or somewhere so she won’t mind.; I finally pressed REGISTER. Red words glared out at the top of the screen: ‘One mandatory field to be filled in.’ It did not tell me where. I scanned all screens again. All fields were present and correct. I pressed REGISTER again. The red words were back. ‘Mandatory field missing in ‘General Information.’ I went to General Information. It was all filled in, dammit! I changed my email to Tabby’s email, in case that was the problem (damn *smacks head* have just realised this may be why I am receiving no Fringe-related mail…). I changed myself from ‘Manager’ to ‘Producer’, in case that helped. I pressed REGISTER. Oh bollox, bollox, bloody red words. I scoured all fields again. Fifteen minutes left. This was when my screen chose to freeze, ball of death spinning. I went upstairs to be nearer the wireless router. Nothing. Clicked on everything, as you do. Zilch. Just frigging frozen wastes. Bloody computers. I debated what to do. If I turned it off and on, would I lose my painstakingly entered info? Possibly. But what else could I do?; I turned it off and on. I waited for the screens. Still comatose. During a teensy window of activity a boxette popped up which told me: ‘Our website is currently experiencing a high volume of traffic…..’ Well of course. All the luvvies had left it to the last minute, just like me. Why didn’t I do it the week before, for God’s sake? I banged my head on the photocopier a few times, chucked paper about and wept and wailed and gnashed my teeth in case that would help. Finally I could not let my student wait any longer, so gave up and went out.; The next day, in a calmer mood, I emailed the Fringe office explaining that I was sorry to have waited til the last day, detailing my strenuous efforts. They replied saying I could register over the phone, charged me the discount rate and were kind and forgiving.; Phew. So that’s done, no sweat, lol. I’ve only gone grey, again. Gosh, sometimes you just think: this is an awful lot of hassle for us to be able to strut and fret our 45 minutes upon the stage and then be heard no more. However, such is the lure of theatre. We must be addicts.",0,1,0.0022545306001188333
742,33,29,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"The rule I have learnt with choosing a venue is: be decisive and get on with it quick by about February, as the good venues get booked up quick. Don’t go for an incredibly popular venue. They can afford to be too picky as to who they take, and some don’t let you know whether you’ve been accepted until it’s too late to find somewhere else. One year we were holding out for the Bedlam, (and not only because they’ve got a wacky caff with soup of the day and gooey chocolate brownies… ) but they kept us hanging on in uncertainty well into April and were not that forthcoming when contacted for news. I would have appreciated it more if they had just said straight out: ‘Find another venue.’ I think it’s better to go with people who like the idea of your show, trust you to put on a decent one, and send you out forms and contracts straight away in a professional manner.; This year we’re going with SPACE. We have gone with them before. The first time we did the Fringe, our show had only two people in it: it was Jason Robert Brown’s ‘The Last Five Years‘. We were advised to be ‘humble’ on our first attempt. We booked Jury’s Inn, a little theatre on the eighth floor of a hotel just off the Mile. We were assured that is better to pack out a smaller space, than be having a nightmare trying to put bums on seats. And we did meet other interesting folk doing it on a shoestring. The show after ours was set in WW2: sirens wailed as you were queuing outside the room. Reassuring ladies came out with blankets and lamps and led us into the ‘air-raid-shelter.’ It was immersive and completely convincing.; Even this time, third time round, we have booked a theatre with only fifty-five seats. It’s enough. The competition is intense. We’ll have to work hard to sell tickets. We’ll be out there on the Royal Mile singing snatches of ‘Lavender, Lavender, Sweet Lavender,’ and ‘One Nice Boot for Sale,’ accompanied by Alfie in his top hat on his oboe, and Old Ma Sivers floating benignly in Victorian garb, selling watercress. Mr Blood will be stomping about terrifying all the little children and Mrs Blood, in her best bonnet, will be pouring forth obscenely high arpeggios. Jem, Ned and Billy will be ‘argufying’ on their fiddle, flute and drums (we hope: more on casting later.) Now, if we were the only show in town, this would be a fool-proof way to grab an audience. People would come out of morbid curiosity and to see what Alfie was going to do with his oboe. However you have to remember, at the Fringe you are competing with thousands of other casts who have honed equally vibrant methods of seeking attention. If somebody decides to come to yours, that is an enormous compliment. So putting the hours into publicity is essential.; And fun. This is a picture of some of our crew from two years ago. Your need to be noticed forces you to evolve. You develop ruses to attract attention. Little Bash and Alfie taking turns lying under a double bass or a tuba moaning and groaning for ‘Help!’ did the trick.; Soon you can also book a couple of twenty-minute slots to perform on the Mile’s outdoor stages to give people a taster of your show and hand out leaflets.; Oh, shizz, I forgot all about blinking leaflets. We’ll have to have them done next. The to-do list becomes longer every time I think about the show. And posters! Not that there is ever much space for anyone’s posters. Let’s hope SPACE manage to find some for ours.; Two years ago we printed some beautiful big posters for The Melody Blog, and by mistake sent them to Zoo Southside instead of Zoo Roxy. They were all lost. We didn’t know this til we turned up and saw everybody’s posters but ours on the walls.; One way to get people to come to your show is to go to theirs. We will be doing a lot of this this year, as our show slot is from 1.30 – 2.30, so we’ll have the rest of the day to see other things. SPACE venues give you comps to see any other SPACE shows for free so long as there are seats free.; So, how else did SPACE fit the bill this time? Well, despite standing out in the pouring rain, Charles Pamment took my call and talked to me. I could hear hail smacking onto his phone and wind howling round his ears but he didn’t seem to mind. When I took a couple of days to think, he emailed me. He remembered us from three years ago. He immediately sent over clear, communicative documents with deadlines and prices, giving me several options of theatres that might suit. Also, he pointed out that every morning of the Fringe, his Surgeons Hall venues hold a children’s festival. This is brilliant, because it means that children will be going to the shows before and after ours and thus will be more likely to hear about ours. We can help each other with publicity. Surgeons Hall is also very central and easy to give directions to from the Royal Mile. (‘Go that way, then right, and it’s on your left,’ type thing.) And, as you can see, it looks well posh with its gleaming pillars which are floodlit at night. It also has a sizeable outside cafe/bar area.; I chose Theatre 1 out of three. The map of it just looked right somehow. The stage is kind of triangular, in the corner. It has a backstage area, very useful. How can we really tell what it’s like without seeing it? We can’t, so…. we just had to go for it.",0,1,0.16283240568954857
744,33,30,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"A few weeks later, in early February, my daughter Tabby was admitted to hospital with a bad episode of ketoacidosis of the blood. She had had a vomiting bug, always dangerous for diabetics, which made her blood glucose shoot up to the point where she couldn’t think straight or inject right. She had been alone in her flat in Glasgow, vomming and hallucinating. She tried to phone the emergency people but forgot it was 999. She was dialling 222 for the third time when Macaulay Culkein, the boy from Home Alone, popped up beside her. ‘Oh wow,’ she said, leering at him, ‘I never thought I’d meet you in the flesh.’; ‘You’ve got to phone your boyfriend,’ said Macaulay.; ‘What was it like, being in all those movies?’; ‘You have to phone Kieran, it’s important,’ said Macaulay. (Jeez, thanks, Macaulay.); Tabby phoned Kieran and slurred her story about Macaulay being there. Kieran called an ambulance and ran like the wind. Tabby’s blood glucose was 50.3 whatever-it-is-units upon admission. If you know about blood glucose you will know this is terrifyingly high. In the high-dependency unit Kieran made to sit in the chair beside Tabby’s bed. ‘Shtop it! You can’t shit there!’ she giggled, cross-eyed, on two drips, ‘Macaulay’s shitting there!’; So anyway, three days later when she was still in hospital and eventually I twigged that she had been really quite ill, Grandalf zoomed me up there in his tiny car. I was pleased to meet the boyfriend as Tabby says he is very very good at singing bass, and acting. Who could be a better Mr Blood? (Apart from, of course, I add hastily, our 2007 Mr Blood, one James Richard Reginald Oscar Rowbottom, who was really excellent and very very scary. But he has moved to Paris, which would be tricky. We need someone constantly on site from around now so they can be mercilessly trained, he he, so sorry Jim…but I’m sure you are happy to be spared.); ‘Oh, hi, Kieran! Would you consider being Mr Blood in our show?’; ‘Just say no,’ said Tabby. Still out of her head, obviously.; Kieran ignored her. ‘Of course I will be Mr Blood,’ he said. He is a gracious, kind person.; I started telling him all about the scene where he would feed Mrs Blood aka Tabby her hot potato and peas, and the one where he would slosh about going mental in the sewer with the rats. I sang him some of the songs. Unfortunately, Tabby had pulled a muscle in her side from hours of intense projectile vomming. Every time she laughed she would go into an excruciating spasm. I was told off for singing: ‘Mr Blood runs an excellent establishment…but he’s FAT….WHO SAID THAT???’ I was badly berated for crooning: ‘These children can ruin one’s life…we gave them shelter, Mr Blood and his wife….’; ‘Stop it, stop it,’ screamed Tabby, in agonies.; ‘It seemed such a shame, to lose more than we gained, so we got evil, we got wicked, we got ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-aaad.’; ‘Mum, I WILL SEND YOU OUT.’; I sat quietly for a minute with my eyes bulging with effort. Then I whispered to Kieran across the bed, ‘Do you mind being Pa as well? You’d have to wear a sack and sing: ‘Put your best foot forward and you’ll reach the top… you won’t want to stop.‘; Tabby had a massive spasm. Sigh. I had to sit there and say nothing. We realised our entire relationship since her birth (that’s almost twenty years) has been solid jokes and laughter. There was lits nothing to say. Even when I was being very good sitting there absolutely shtum, my very face made her laugh, so I had to go and sit in the caff. God, she had really lost her sense of humour. She even complained about the text I sent her the second day she was in hospital: ‘Are there any dishy doctors?’; ‘You really didn’t understand how ill I was, did you?’ she said.; ‘Look, even a person on their death-bed can surely appreciate a dishy doctor,’ was my very sane view. I mean, let’s be honest, that’s the whole point of going to hospital, isn’t it?",0,1,0.1000936768149883
745,33,31,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"We have exciting news: we are taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe. You may remember that years ago, Chloe wrote a musical based on a children’s book called ‘The Jammy Dodgers go Underground.’ Many kind and helpful actors, stage-hands, props people, lighting people, producers and musicians helped us, in 2007, to bring this show to the stage, once in our house and once at school. Bash and I still, in the car, sometimes spontaneously launch into the harmonies of Billy’s separation song: ‘I’ve been left…left behind….and I’m bind with all these kids who are unkind….it’s late at night… this don’t feel right… I’m alone and scared without the light....’. Jem and Ned come in with ‘We’ve got to find Billy…stop being so silly…but he might be dying, bet he’s crying….we’ll keep trying.’ Anyway, it’s all very catchy and quite daft. It was the best fun ever, but for the last few years we have been sadly thinking of it as really and truly in the past.; Not so! The other day I had an email from Bowering Sivers, otherwise known as Brenda, or, lately ‘Old Ma Sivers’, the author of the Jammy Dodgers. Much email correspondence had gone on between us in the build-up to the school show. She loved the musical and came to two of the performances, signing the books at the back of the hall. We have kept in touch ever since. So this new email said that Brenda was launching the e-books of the Jammy Dodgers, and could she come back to our school and find a new set of wonderful actors to play brothers Jem, Ned and Billy for the new interactive website? After a few emails to help her get in touch with the school, we spontaneously decided that a Fringe version of the musical was just begging to be created, to celebrate The Jammy Dodgers bursting onto the digital scene. After all, Chloe had managed, in 2008, with a lot of effort, to shrink the two-hour script down to forty-five minutes for entry into a ‘Lost Theatre’ competition, which came to nothing but was a bit of a drastic exercise in editing.; At the end of the Christmas holidays we managed to find Chloe’s old battered laptop and with surprisingly little hassle, located this ‘Lost Theatre Jammy Dodgers’ document. Tabby had gone back to Glasgow already but Chloe and Bashi and I lay in bed with all the dogs and cats and a cup of tea, doing a sing-through. This was not easy, as memories of the show made us die laughing so we could hardly get through it. Alfie put his head round the door several times. ‘Alfie, you’re Zeke,’ Chloe told him. Zeke is Mr and Mrs Blood’s ghastly child.; ‘What?’ said Alfie.; ‘We want you on your oboe.’; ‘Does Zeke play oboe?’; ‘He does now…’; ‘Come on Alf. You get to wear a top hat,’ I said.; Bash said she really, really wanted to do the show, but Chloe was having a moment of doubt: ‘Isn’t this a step back though?’; See, Chloe’s ‘Plato – the Musical’, my ‘Tits – the Musical’ and ‘The World according to Shardonnay – the Musical’ have all been recent contenders for possible Fringe efforts. I said: ‘Hmm, yes, but…it’s like, we have a commission. That’s kind of cool, to have a commission. And Plato the Musical is not ready. Tits the Musical won’t be ready til we have a cast of fifty women willing to bare their breasts. Shardonnay could be ready whenever, as it doesn’t have that many characters, just Shardonnay, her husband and the choir of blondie boys. But Shardonnay can wait…’; ‘Plus, doing Jammy Dodgers would be more fun,’ said Bashi. ‘And I could be Clara…’; ‘We’re cutting out Clara,’ said Chloe.; ‘Cutting out Clara?’ we chorused in dismay.; ‘Forty-five minutes!’ said Chloe. ‘We can’t get the whole book in. It’s not possible.’; She’s right. She’s a realist regarding length. Ooh, sounds rude, but isn’t.; ‘The audience will mainly be children, remember,’ I said. ‘And they don’t care what it’s like, so long as it’s fun.’; ‘Hmm,’ mused Chloe, darkly. ‘Children are the most demanding audience of all.’ She could be right there as well. But the Jammy Dodgers is full of wonderful material for children. Don’t kids love evil baddies? Mr and Mrs Blood are absolutely brilliant nasty creations.; I said, ‘Brenda is really excited about dressing up in Victorian garb as Old Ma Sivers and standing out on the Royal Mile, selling bunches of watercress.’; ‘Really?’ said Chloe, brightening. ‘….Oh god, all right then. We’ll do it.’; ‘We could do Plato the Musical simultaneously,’ I suggested.; ‘I would rather do one musical well, than two badly,’ she said. Wise person.; So: the Tingeys are en route for the Fringe. Whoopee. I have decided to start blogging again, but this time not about cancer, not about gin club, but about How to Put On a Fringe Show, all aspects of. (You will find all these posts in the ‘Tingeys go to the Fringe‘ category at the top of the home page, I hope, if Fred has done it properly.) It’s a very interesting process and there is a lot to learn, even third time round. Maybe it will inspire other creatives to give it a go, and they can learn from our bound-to-be catalogue of errors! Never mind! This is the Fringe. People go there wanting to witness cheap and experimental barmy creations. Tis not the Edinburgh Festival proper, nor the Albert Hall, nor the Barbican, nor nuffin.; Come on! We’ve only got four months to get this show on the road!",0,1,0.11745912950550048
747,33,33,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"(Another World Premiere for this ALL-NEW never-before-published episode of The Gin Club, which was written in October 2013.); My son Alfie has a lovely girlfriend called Sophie. She asked me if the Gin Club would be going to the pub she works in, The Nag’s Head.; Ooh, nothing we like more than an invite. Just Boring picked me up in her Mini. She’s doing Sober October, so she’s F***ing Boring now.; The Nag’s Head is a lot bigger inside than it looks outside. Very art deco. Packed with post-work spill-out making themselves heard at the bar.; Sophie was being a brilliant waitress. F***ing Boring ordered a coke. I should’ve told her coke is evil and kills worse than alcohol but am I really bovvered? You can bang on about things all you like but people never listen.; Our friend and culture vulture Poppy (not her real name!) joined us for gin as she lives nearby, and was holding one of her many book groups there later. We talked about Pippa Middleton calling our new headmaster ‘undeniably fanciable’. Was this a slur on his reputation, in the very week he started at the school? It did lower the tone a bit, we agreed. ‘Well, it did…and it didn’t,’ said Poppy, ‘because it was a member of the Royal Family.’ Yes, anyone else in the whole world and it would have lowered the tone. ‘Even Nelson Mandela?’; ‘Well, he wouldn’t have said it…’ said Mad Lucy, rather reasonably, for her.; Conversation moved on to the Stortford Threader, a fearsome woman who lurks in Jackson Square. ‘She plucks hairs out of their roots viciously and quickly,’ declared Mad Lucy.; ‘Ooh, go on, tell us about when she looked at your chin,’ I said.; ‘Oh alright…’ We all leaned forward, clutching our gins. We’d heard the story many times before. ‘She’d finished my eyebrows. I got up to go but then…’ we held our breath, ‘….she looked at my chin, up close, very close. She looked me in the eye and said, ‘Chin?’ I shook my head, terrified. ‘But you have very hairy chin!’ she exclaimed, her words booming around Jackson Square. ‘Very hairy chin, very hairy upper lip, very hairy sides of face, VERY HAIRY FOREHEAD!’ ‘; We howled with laughter. Mad Lucy does it so well. She ended up with a stripped face. F***ing Boring said she likes to tidy up her minge, but does not want a nude minge. Poppy said absolutely no nude minges because they result from the dictates of the porn industry. We talked about Movember, and Caitlin Moran’s Hairy Muff chapter. It is sad that the youf feel obliged to be hair-free, and suffer in-growing hairs, cystitis, irritation. Poppy maintained this pressure is culture-led.; I said, ‘well, when we had Alfie in a New York birthing centre, they wanted to whisk him off to hack off his foreskin. I had to hang on to him for dear life.’; Mad Lucy, who has spent time in Iran, muttered ‘Read the Koran….Sand under the foreskin, not good.’; ‘We didn’t live in a very sandy place,’ I pointed out.; ‘Well, no, but if you lived in the desert in a yurt you might want to get it done.’; Tu-Gin-Su mentioned Tracy Emin’s image of a plucked chicken ‘on her bits’. Did Tracy do this to make us hate the nude minge? Probably, because it’s a horrible image. We talked about how sometimes men are forced to be waxed too, even on their tender bollocks.; Ooh, that gave me an idea. I could volunteer my dear husband to have his bollocks waxed for charity. He would raise tons of money! So, if you meet him in town, please congratulate him on his philanthropy. He’ll have no idea what you’re on about, as he never reads anything I write. This means he’ll only find out once his Justgiving page reaches five grand, we start the camera for Youtube rolling and tell him it’s time. ‘Time for what?’ he’ll say.; ‘Time to get your bollocks waxed, of course,’ we will say. ‘A thousand people have donated a fiver for this to happen. You can’t pull out now.’; Sigh. What a wondrous image: I feel a short story brewing. Anyway, back to our conversation: ‘I like to stay hairy,’ I said, ‘because I like being an animal.’; ‘Now that could be interpreted in several ways,’ said Mad Lucy.; F***ing Boring said primly, (remember she’s Sober for October), ‘well, I prefer being neatly trimmed.’; Poppy said, ‘The real problem is that the need for smoothness is so embedded in our culture that people don’t realise they have a choice.’; ‘Hairy is ugly though,’ said F***ing Boring.; Poppy said, ‘Why should something entirely natural be ugly?’ She then ruined her point by confessing that her highly principled tufty pits made her so self-conscious at her aqua-aerobics class that she had to stop going.; Sophie approached to take glasses away. ‘Let’s ask the youf what they think,’ I said. ‘Sophie, do your mates feel obliged to wax or shave all over?’; Sophie laughed but wisely did not enlighten us as to the hairiness of her mates. She did bring us another Guinness or three though.; Tu-Gin-Su said, ‘we don’t want hairy bits popping out of our tights though, do we?’; Mad Lucy told us how she wore the hijab in Iran and wafted around in the heat of the desert. She said underneath there’s a surprising amount of glamour going on.; I told them all about the big Russian mamas in the waxing parlour in NYC where they used to give people accidental orgasms. Oh alright, by people, I mean me. Look, it was completely unintentional! Not my fault! BTW I bet it happens all the time, but no one ever fesses up. Seriously not easy grappling with small-talk while in unexpected throes though.; Shit. Should have gone Sober for October. Then these embarrassing things would never come out.; F***ing Boring said to Poppy, ‘Just because you’re hairy doesn’t mean you can’t be my friend.’; Poppy said, ‘Equally, just because you’re smooth’ (and fucking boring, she should have added) ‘it doesn’t mean you can’t be my friend.’; I decided to hang around for Poppy’s ‘book’ group. They had apparently prophesied: ‘By the time we turn up you’ll be proper mashed.’; They turned up, and true to form, we was already proper mashed.",0,-1,-0.11229508944870392
748,33,34,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Records and old framed posters of bands who have played at the Half Moon bestrew the walls. The round tables are painted a glossy black, with one of those teensy records stuck in the middle…what did we used to call them? Singles? 45s? This is just it, the shop is so delightfully retro you can feel your brain shunting back into a seventies, eighties mode. You need your flares and Grateful Dead t-shirt on really or at the very least a perm.; Oh my God, it’s only gone and triggered a flashback to my very first single! It was by Soul Asylum and was my brother Pete’s, but I nicked it. It was called ‘Put The Bone In‘. Yeah, sounds rude! And probably was rude, thinking about it… It went ‘Put the bone in/ She begged him/ Once more/ My doggie’s been hit by/ A car/ And I do want to bring,/ Him home something/ Put the bone in/ She yelled out once more.’ Honestly in those days, people made songs out of the weirdest scenarios. And Lord only knows what was on the B side! Or maybe ‘Put The Bone In’ was the B side. Now that would make sense. In which case, I wonder what the hell was on the A side?; Can you remember sliding the record out of its sleeve, lowering the needle, watching a speck of dust go round and round? Can you still hear the crackle before the song started? Staring at the rhythmically undulating surface (if yours were warped like mine), you really got the word Groove.; We turned up for the grand opening and to find good records for Mad Lucy’s upcoming vinyl night. A DJ was strutting and fretting his hour upon the stage. Not really: he was chilled. The doors were open to the garden. Warm winds blew through the crowds flipping through records. The bar at the back of the room had become a counter. Still with handles for pulling beers though. Ooh, look! Merchandise! Badges, T-shirts, picks.; I’ll let you in on a secret. Remember that gorjuss Popstar who was behind the bar in the Star? Well, *whisper* he runs the ‘record shop’. He can’t leave if you arrive. He’s got to stay there, lol, it’s his job and he’s a sitting duck. Feel free. Gaze in awe as much as you like. Just don’t say any of the things in this video I came across on facebook: ‘shit people say in record stores.’; Top Tip: don’t turn up before midday. This shop only opens at midday. People who run record shops are obviously way too cool to be awake at any point during the morning due to the fact they are up all night listening to records or gigging in far-flung raves.; Another Top Tip: make sure you know what your favourite record is and make sure it’s a cool choice, otherwise you will never ever get a job there. My favourite record is not Put the Bone In, surprisingly enough, but is Captain Beefheart’s Blue Jeans and Moonbeams, with the track Party of Special Things to Do. In 1990, as Mill Road housemates, Fred and I, our friend Wozzie and the improbably named Abigail Rainbird Tripp held our very own Party of Special Things to Do. I can highly recommend it. It’s always good to provide things for your guests to do, keep em busy. There was table football in the bathroom, hacky sac, jamming, tree climbing, cocktail-shaking, throat-singing (this involved a bong and ended badly, I remember), backgammon, chess and probably some less benign things wot I have forgotten due to the nature of the event…but I DO remember learning that hallucinogens and big brown slug invasion do not go at all well together. We live and learn. This is a good thing.; After rummaging the Janis Joplin we sat out in the pub stable yard with our pints of Hobgoblin. Top Tip: don’t sit in the shorter squarish wicker seats. They are vicious and dig into your back. Go for the high-backed chairs and from there admire the rampant sunflowers, old stable doors, higgledy-piggledy mossy rooftops and chimney pots. Old England at its best.; Anyway, so! Fabulous hangout to meet up with friends, the ‘record shop.’ I told my Chloe about it, using ‘the fingers’. She got the wrong end of the stick entirely, gasped and exclaimed, ‘Oh wow! Is it a brothel?’; Ha ha, no, we don’t think so. One thing we are sure of: it’s a great excuse for a pint.",0,1,0.1237337662337662
749,33,35,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"People have been messaging me and stopping me in the street to tell me all about the Grey Lady of the Tunnels. ‘I’m sure the Tunnel starts up at St Mary’s school‘ said one mysterious Tunnel Authority, who also ‘works’ at the ‘record shop’…’from the days when it was a convent and the nuns had to hide from all the randy priests (or something like that). The old caretaker at the school told us that the Grey Lady was a nun who committed suicide by throwing herself from the top window.’; Bit harsh, I say: couldn’t she just have hoiked up her habit and kicked the randy priest in the bollocks? Or, *gasp*, what if she didn’t jump: what if she was pushed? From all her spying out of cubbyholes had she maybe witnessed something untoward?; The Tunnel Authority continued: ‘On another occasion the caretaker told us she hanged herself from the roof beams and showed us the marks in the wood. I’m trying to work out in which order she committed this double suicide. Maybe she survived the fall and ran back upstairs to try something else? I’m also intrigued as to why she’s the Grey Lady…surely all female ghosts are Grey Ladies….or do ghosts come in a variety of hues?’; I think most towns have a Grey Lady. Our poor lass probably just wants that rotter priest’s gravestone defiled, then she’ll rest in peace.; I bumped into landlord Pete et al outside the Whore’s Bed (yes, if you want a social life, just hang around on them front steps during the day) and he told me he had started excavating the tunnel. Because of our interest, he’s getting some real ghost-busters in, electronic equipment and all, from half-ten on a Sunday night in the near future, til three in the morning. Another chap, Mel, out on them steps assured me (‘if my Missus were around, she would tell you’) the tunnel does go down via the George and the Star all the way to the castle.; ‘So they say,’ chipped in Pete, lighting up another ciggie. He really should give up.; ‘So they say…’ agreed Mel….’so they say.’; He insisted though that he and the Missus had seen both the Grey Lady and some fellow who died four hundred years ago. Phyllis-next-door later told me that some visitors saw a chap quite clearly standing at the window in one of her upstairs bedrooms, looking out into the garden.; I found lots of detailed stories of spirits at the Star, the High Street, the Boar’s, Coopers, and many more Bishop’s Stortford locations on the Luton Paranormal website. At the quiz night I also found out about this Ghosts of Stortford lecture coming up at the Rhodes. The description of the evening mentions not only the Grey Lady but also the Duelling Cavalier – blimey, who’s he? It’s on the 30 th of October, practically Hallowe’en. I’m going with Phyllis-next-door. I’ve been interested ever since about forty years ago when my Granny Peggy told me she was slapped on the back with a wet flannel whilst having a bath.; Fred says it’s more likely that the spooks are aliens having us on than spirits of dead people. Come on, ghosts! I hereby invoke you to float about a bit and give cynic Fred a fright one night!",0,1,0.08487573099415205

The hair sprung to attention like a massive light-bulb. ‘You need a hairdresser who will RELAX your hair,’ she advised. Mad Lucy agreed. ‘Yes, you really need RELAXED hair,’ she said. Oh bloody hell! The pressure.; We had our usual: Guinness, vodka, gin. The barmaid, Naomi, looks just like Tank Girl. She also has the most fantastic collection of tattoos, some even on her neck and scalp. She’s not got much space left. She’s had nearly 100 hours done and recommends the local parlour on South Street.; We were sitting by the window, next to a wood-burner, at a long, warped table. The view is all battlements, turrets and flint of St Michael’s. This pub must do well out of weddings, funerals, christenings. A papier-mache boar’s head grins out of the window with an apple in its mouth.; We discussed the Radio 4 Ethical Debates. They are tricky, as both or multiple sides are compelling. Then we got onto Jimmy Savile. We were kids when ‘Jim’ll Fix It’ was on telly. I wanted a pony but so did everyone else so I knew there was no point asking Jim. Just Boring desperately wanted to escape from Alcatraz, as you do, but, having well-developed Perv Radar, found Jim too creepy to apply.; Oh, the karaoke started up. The landlord, Pete, who used to be the mayor of Stortford, did a rendition of ‘You Are Always On My Mind,’ quite well really, must be said. He then brought us a plate of spicy Caribbean chicken and introduced us to Adi, his new chef. ‘Ooh, this is so good,’ we told Adi. ‘How do you make it?’; ‘I can’t tell you that,’ he smiled.; ‘Please! Garlic?…chilli? Maybe paprika?’; ‘The last person who got that secret out of me owns KFC,’ he said.; Fred turned up and we got talking about the tunnel we’ve always been told runs from our house via this pub to Waytemore Castle. We asked Naomi if she knew anything about it. ‘Oh yes,’ she said. ‘Down in the cellar there’s an archway with a couple of steps heading up that way,’ she gestured up Windhill, ‘but it’s bricked up.’; ‘Ooh,’ we breathed, feeling like we were in an Enid Blyton adventure. When we first moved into our house, we squeezed through a trap-door into a cavernous dusty expanse under the floor, and spent ages looking for the tunnel, but it’s murky down there.; That first year we held a halloween party. Fred hung severed hands and staring china dolls on nooses down in that spooky space and trailed a parade of spiders and a lost valley of dinosaurs, arranged according to their correct geological epochs, through the dust. He put the girls’ My-Size Dancing Barbie Doll, bleeding from her eyes, under a ghostly green light…you get the idea. He made a sign: ‘Fred’s Secret Passage,’ and, dressed in dark robes with a gory mask and scythe, stood by the trapdoor.; Thirteen years later, people in the town are still talking about Fred’s Secret Passage. He still says ‘If I had a pound for every person who went down there….’; Mad Lucy’s Nigel arrived. He reminisced upon his youf, thoroughly misspent in the Boar’s, local lad that he is. Ahh Bleeess, we could just imagine him in 1980 at the age of 17. ‘I had my first snakebite in here,’ he said, all wistful.; ‘What is a snakebite?’ I asked.; ‘Something foul I think,’ whispered Mad Lucy.; ‘It’s half cider, half lager, blackcurrant and pernod,’ said Nigel.; ‘Ugh,’ we went.; ‘No, a snakebite’s just scrumpy and lager,’ said Fred.; ‘Maybe you’re right,’ said Nigel. ‘Mine was more a Black Adder, I think.’; ‘Sounds disgusting, whichever way you had it,’ we said.; ‘This was the only pub that would serve you,’ said Nigel. ‘Tchuh! Next to the Police Station as well!’; ‘Ha ha, right!’ said Fred.; Mad Lucy said we should ask Naomi to yank a brick out of the blocked tunnel and shout ‘hallooooooo!’ down it, and some of us lot should go home and get down Fred’s Secret Passage to have a listen. ‘Go on!’ she urged. ‘I’m sure Naomi will get her trowel out.’ The landlord promised us he would go down there next week and unblock it.; Imagine the joint Halloween Party we and the Boar’s could hold down in the tunnel! Mmm, we’ll need lashings of ginger beer! Will report back on excavational progress: stay tuned.",0,-1,-0.12099275724275728

It means they can nip home to adjust the cooking while they are having gin.; Mad Lucy was at the round table in the red-curtained bay window looking onto the road. ‘Nice view,’ said Just Boring, pointing out at a dirty white van. She tipped the remains of last week’s kitty out of the kitty sock. We peered at the few manky quid coins suspiciously. God knows why we trust her with our crisp tenners, she’s probably out on the town with them every night.; We got the drinks in. Pint of Guinness for me, gin for Tu-Jin-Su, Just Boring and Jet-setting Jen, Vodka for Mad Lucy. The table is enormous. It would work well for Hearts, Forecast Whist, or Crib. Who needs cards though when you can talk about sex?; Four bespectacled blokes were embroiled in erudite argument at the bar. Four lads were strutting their stuff at the pool table. A couple were snogging up against the wall. I peeked out at the deck. Only half-five but three tables were already groaning with locals. The Wheatsheaf is a really popular pub. I guess all the Barrels Down Lane people just roll down the hill. It’s also the first port of call for Rye Street and Lindsey Road dwellers on a night out.; Just Boring told us the pub used to be dark and so packed you could hardly get in, but now it’s been done up: it smells of fresh paint and instead of sticky carpet there are gleaming boards. We got another round in and started talking about orgasms, (might as well start with orgasms as they are bound to feature at some point), Mumford and Sons and The Joy of Sex. These last two go together according to Jet-setting Jen; it’s to do with the beards.; Despite it being boiling hot, (or maybe because of that, who knows?) it started pouring down outside. A swirly brown river rushed down Northgate End. Thunder rumbled. Water ran in gurgling sheets down the windows. Hmm, even we knew that was a gutter problem. The landlord came to shut our window as we were getting splashed as well as smashed. He told us he’s doing three years and then he’s promised his other half he’ll give it up, have a normal life, do normal things. We told him he had a gutter problem.; The rain slammed even harder at the window. We got all excited: ooh, you never get bored of the weather in England, do you? Then we noticed it was raining, hard, inside, in the bar area! We found this so funny that we got even more rowdy than the boys and canoodly couple in the pool area.; We talked about Marina Coils and their occasional disturbing migration to other parts of the body, the exciting use of the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica as a cure for Type 1 Diabetes, blow-jobs, (we always have to talk about blow-jobs), stirrups (? Yeah, you’d better ask Just Boring; apparently it’s nothing to do with horses), and a play called Hand Jobs that Tu-Jin-Su read out loud with her book group. ‘There were too many parts. We all had to double up,’ she said.; ‘Fnarr, fnarr.’ We choked on our fourth gins. Evidently we have reached a new low.; We thought about having a cocktail. I said if I was going to create a cocktail I would call it a Vajazzle and serve it with a bejewelled furry umbrella and a clitorally suggestive olive at the fork of a two-pronged stirrer. Just Boring claimed to have had a Hanky Panky and a Flirtini but never a Vajazzle. She’s discovered a new cocktail called a Slippery Nipple. I imagine it adorned with a peeled lychee. She got so pissed on them that she asked her mother-in-law if she had shlippery nipples. LOLZ. Must get the recipe off her. Oh – she says it’s Bailey’s and Sambuca. No lychees.

And we do just love playing with balls. It’s all about technique, the loose elbow, splayed fingers, secure grip.; I trundled down Bell’s Hill, all psyched. I snaffled Just Boring for my team as she can be relied upon to be snarly when it comes to the crunch. Yeah, you don’t need a drippy hippy partner for pool. Mad Lucy’s witchy black magic ain’t gonna get her far when it comes to a sticky situation over a pound note, methinks.; The barman helped us set up the balls in the triangle thingy. He was laughing at us already. He kindly suggested putting our gins onto a table a bit further away from the action.; Hav U chalked her cue, eyes narrowed and looking scarily like a pro. ‘You can be on our team,’ Just Boring said.; ‘You will regret that,’ laughed Hav U. Yeah, we did: she couldn’t pot a ball to save her life.; Mad Lucy was investigating the cue rest. Dammit Janet thought it was a branding iron. Yeah, she’s from Colorado. The barman laughed again on his way past to the garden. ‘You can’t do that!’ he said.; ‘Why not?’ asked Mad Lucy. ‘We need all the help we can get.’; I love the whole chalk thing: I chalked my cue and gave it a good blow. I also like to give the balls a good smack which doesn’t often result in any potting.; Dammit Janet did a bit of measuring up before her shot, ooh fancy.; Just Boring managed to hit a red but Mad Lucy was unfortunately getting the hang of the game: ‘That was a red wot you just made move but you’re not on my team,’ she complained.; Her next shot, Just Boring put the white down. Two shots for our opponents. ‘Not that that will help us any,’ said Tu-Gin-Su.; ‘Just watch where you put it, alright?’ advised Mad Lucy as Dammit Janet leant over for a long shot with one leg hoiked up over the table edge.; I tried to remember Fred’s advice: go softly softly and try to leave the balls nearer the pockets than they were before. Problem: the drunker you get, the harder it is to hit the blinkin white ball, let alone get that one to hit another one.; ‘Chalk! More chalk!’ Su urged Mad Lucy. She, however, was too busy complaining about her squeaky new implants. ‘My old mattress-quality PIP ones were much better than these,’ she claimed as she lined up her balls. ‘These ones go ‘eek eek eek’ when I’m going up the stairs.’; ‘Concentrate!’ urged her team. She did a tremendous yet random three ball plant which furthered them none.; Hav U potted a ball. ‘And it was the right colour,’ she crowed. Then she potted one of each colour. ‘Yeah, I wanted it to be even. And I felt sorry for the other team.’; Tu-Gin-Su had a most unorthodox overarm cueing action going on. ‘We’re red aren’t we?’ she asked.; Onlookers were drawn in to our increasingly flustered attempts to get the bastard buggery balls in. You know it’s going badly when everyone around, including you, starts offering helpful advice. My nuggets were: ‘Smack it in! Smack it!’ and ‘Hit it at the bottom otherwise the white will….oh, too late!’; Mad Lucy tried one of those advanced shots where you jab downwards at the white. ‘I’ll be your backstop,’ offered Tu-Gin-Su. The white skittered off to the side, hitting no balls. ‘Well, that doesn’t work, clearly,’ said Mad Lucy.; Just Boring screamed. She had potted a yellow. Rejoicing and hugs happened. We live for these moments.; Tu-Gin-Su tried a longer cue. Long is good. We like em long. Nice smooth back and forth action. Luckily a cool breeze was blowing through from the open doors and windows. There is a flowery bowery deck out back. Sunny, with a whole load of beer in barrels, always a big bloke-magnet, if you happen to have any with you.; Jeez, I’d only looked away for a second, but Mad Lucy had managed to get herself tangled up in an assortment of cues and branding irons. Luckily it was all for show as none of them were near the white nor black. ‘Can I pay you to take my shot?’ she asked Dammit Janet.; We had to have another game and more drinks, as we couldn’t face leaving: from the Bricklayers it’s majorly uphill in almost all directions. That’s ‘Eek, eek, eek,’ all the way home, for some of us.; Top Tip 1: When the pubs in the centre of town are packed out and you can no longer hear yourself think, ramble over here for some relative peace and a table to yourselves.; Top Tip 2: If you accidentally lose control of your cue and poke your opponent’s buttock just as they are drawing their cue back, it wreaks havoc with their shot.",0,-1,-0.042164078454401045

I straited the new neeks and, since the queue was throbling, we just troed at it: dying, vlombing, plaiting, cutting the vringes and then zlicking and snippisnipping into them to give them that natural look. Luckily FF Timps are always well-trained. They have nifty blingers and get what I’m montring them first time. We had to call Bowares to get a nother vat of that horbil H13green stuff in.

She is mad, you see. She likes to think she is having great hair-slurrying sex, like, all the time.; Just Boring started narrowing her eyes, quoting Miss Halligan from Annie, God knows why. Honestly, three jugs of Pimms and there is no continuity! ‘Little girls, little girls, everywhere I look I can see them.’ Shame the ‘mad’ epithet has been used up already. It’s true though that once you meet Just Boring’s little kid, it is kinda hard to get her out of your head. Not that you would want to, I add hastily. I took her for her flute exam the other day. ‘Should we write down which pieces we have chosen?’ I asked the invigilator.; ‘No, this examiner likes to chat to the candidates about their choices,’ he said.; ‘Oh, may the Lord save his poor soul,’ I said. She’s Grade 8 already in chatting.; I wrestled money for the kitty from my phone-pouch. The girls had a good laugh at this pouch because it is beige and crocheted. Hey, you must admit I am ‘litrally’ the only person in the world who never loses their phone. Honest they would fly off the shelves. We should go into immediate pouch production with this snappy jingle: ‘So uncool that it’s cool!’; Many things have been invented at Gin Club. We are normally too pissed to remember any of them. However, how could anyone forget the crotchless onesie? Why do these not exist? If any garment needs a crotchless bit, it would be the onesie, as they’re a right old pain to peel off when you want a wee, (or a bonk if you are Mad Lucy), and you get cold shoulders. Just googled crotchless onesie and it is in fact a Scientific Funk album! Hmm, most odd.; So we were onto our third jug of Pimms and Just Boring was telling the tale of us going to see the plastic surgery people about maybe getting a nipple made for my reconstructed boob. The nurse told us that you can get these prosthetic nipples made exactly to match the nipple you still have or did have.; I butted in on her story: ‘I really don’t want one of them though. I’m scared it might come off in somebody’s mouth.’; Amidst the gales of laughter this comment provoked, Jet-setting Jen, who is a bit of a whizz in business and the like, came up with a great invention on the spot: edible gummy-bear stick-on nipples for nipple-less peeps. Jingle: ‘Even people with nipples want one!’",0,-1,-0.08126587301587304
756,33,41,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"So, much excited by the thought that it was forbidden, there we convened. The pub is a tardis. The front, right on the narrow pavement of the High Street, offers hanging baskets and chipped, pale blue windows. Creak open the door and you enter a cavernous interior, bursting with eccentrically varied pockets of space begging for intimate conversation. Low ceilings, high vaults, blue walls, red walls, a table with human legs. All helped by the fact the huge bar curves around the ancient courtyard, so you have easy access from all areas.; I turned up with Dammit Janet. We ordered pints of Guinness from the lovely bartender who is in fact a jolly famous local musician chap. Dammit Janet fell for his charms instantly. I felt proud that I knew him. He was ace at the Stortford Music Festival, you shoulda seen him. I had a look around. Even though it was only five thirty on a every table was taken.; Ah, there was Mad Lucy: she had nabbed a spot deep in the darkish back room, where tiny Christmas lights unseasonishly sparkle out of the gloom, clinging to upright wormy beams. Forgotten fake poinsettia are also dotted about. Bizarre, if you notice that sort of thing.; ‘Gosh, did you get served by that gorgeous chap?’ gasped Mad Lucy.; ‘Yes, I know him, he’s a pop-star,’ I said nonchalantly.; Mad Lucy was suitably wide-eyed. Just Boring and Jet-setting Jen turned up and were like: ‘Bloody Hell, who is that guy behind the bar?’; ‘Oh, just a pop-star that I know. You know, he sings that song, ‘Rats! Rats! Don’t come back here!” A thought struck me. ‘No wonder the youf don’t want us in here. They want to keep all the blinkin pop-stars to themselves.’; Tu-Gin-Su arrived. ‘Gosh, that chap behind the bar is gorjuss!’ she said.; ‘Oh, he’s just a pop-star we know,’ we chorused.; We all vied to be the one to grasp the kitty and get the drinks in across the wonky floor. It’s definitely downhill on the way to the bar and distinctly uphill away from it so you really can’t tell how drunk you are. After a few trips the popstar himself started delivering the gin and pints of Guinness to our table, what service! He could probably see that, onto our fourth round, the floor was about to claim those pints and our faces.; A sudden influx of dudes and the atmosphere was hotting up. You can see why no one in there can be bothered to take down the Christmas decorations. It’s cos well wacky things are going on in that hub of a pub. It’s awash with bubbling undercurrents of creative energy. Ideas and plans are zinging about. And OK, there are quite a lot of youf in there, but we were certainly not the only mature drinkers. Anyway, we’re getting out there as of now to reclaim the town!; People left so we slid into a beamed alcove with ancient leather chairs and a sinky sofa, behind which three enormous clocks hang, all telling different times. The beams peak high above you.; TOP TIP: if it’s ‘litrally’ POPSTARS you want, check out this chilled, timeless nook every other Wednesday: the wacky-as-fuck Lizard Lounge this week had Jimmy, a wiry, rude and talented rapper, (and his mum, yeah, she’s the best bit!), then The Strangerhood with Dean Austin of the Wacky Hairdo and Chiselled Cheekbones, Ryan Thwaites with his Funky Orange Rhythm Sticks, Tim Webster on his neon-green-stringed bass and Ed Jackman strumming away. You may well ask why these groovy guys are not touring the biggest venues in the land? Let’s face it, we are well lucky that Bishop’s Stortford, our little town, can claim these shit-hot musicians as its own.; TOP TIP number two: the internal courtyard, with its shady green parasols, creepers and the statue missing not only its head but its torso too, is probs the coolest place in town for getting pissed this summer.",0,1,0.03702433166248955
758,33,43,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Hi there. Sorry for not keeping you in the loop. Or loops I should say, as things are zinging out of control round here man.; I have several things to say.; Firstly, I went to Glasgow with Tabby to take all her stuff up there as she is studying at the Conservatoire. We stayed with my cousin Meg. She showed me a video of this man called Hale Dwoskin. The best thing about him is his bonkers laugh. He was talking and laughing about the unlimited field of possibilities right in front of us if only we care to discover it. I know all this shit, really, I already do, but it reminded me not to waste a single day. I went home and did a couple of his ‘paraliminals’ which is where you listen, preferably with headphones (which I did not have), to him talking one thing in one ear and another thing in another. It’s about letting go. He said to focus on an area that was giving me difficulty and ‘can you just let it go?’ I thought about the corridor and how it is full of crap. I let it go, just like he told me to. A couple of days later I cleared up the corridor. Pretty odd. Very odd, if you take into consideration that we have not cleared up the corridor in fourteen years.; I told Janet about it. She came round and we did some paraliminals. In the first of five, Hale puts you in a kind of trance so he can brainwash you better. You start to feel very relaxed and pliable. You don’t know what he’s saying because one ear is hearing one thing and the other another thing. It’s all a mush of words and phrases. After four paraliminals, Janet blinked (slowly) and said she had to go as she had shizz to do. ‘Oh, OK,’ I said, and started to listen to number five on my own. Half-way through Hale said something like: ‘Now I am going to start bringing you out of your deep trance…..five….start to bring your mind slowly back into the present….four……so you are beginning to be aware of things around you…..three, so you are almost back in the world……two…..you are getting ready to open your eyes and be perfectly awake….one….you are now awake and you are opening your eyes.’; I opened my eyes. I realised with horror that Janet must have gone off while still in the trance. I phoned her up. ‘How are you?’ I asked.; ‘Errr, I’m kind of OK,’ she said, ‘but I crashed the car into a tree on the way out of your drive.’; So, since being brainwashed by Hale Dwoskin, several things have happened. I have a new job. I am a French teacher at Euromondiale down the bottom of Bell’s Hill. It is the best fun ever. I make the students work very hard, he he. If anyone turns up to learn Modern Greek, I am ready and waiting. No takers so far. Damn.; I have also become a novel-writing teacher! Ha ha. That’s good that is! Sometimes I think I know nothing about novel-writing and sometimes I think I know loads. I have a little flute pupil, Lucy, out in Radwinter. Her sister Anna wants to write novels. I said I could maybe help her. By the time we had our first meeting, she had outlined five chapters. Wow, her novel is much better than mine! It’s set in Roman times. Melissa’s mother is very ill. The only thing that could maybe save her is the honey from her childhood island. Melissa is sent away to Athens to stay with an evil Aunt. She runs away to find the island and the honey, accompanied by her sister Letta, Nikos, a greek boy she saved from drowning, and Akua, the wicked Auntie’s slave girl. They brave storms, evil kidnappers (the greek boy unbeknownst to them is a rich prince), trampling horses, injury, crumbling cliffs, hidden caves of jewels, a mad and mysterious bee-keeper and swarms of bees attacking them. It is so exciting. Who is the crazy bee-keeper? Will they manage to get the honey? Will it be in time to save their mother? When the story gets made into an e-book I will post the link on here.; So the hour a week I have been spending with Anna, hoisting sails upon the Aegean and eavesdropping on kidnappers in ancient taverns, has just been the best fun. Really, if someone said ‘What is your absolute ideal job in the world?’ I would say, ‘Helping a child to create a novel.’ It gives me the biggest buzz. All the way home from Radwinter I have to have the radio off, because I am living the story, ravelling it and unravelling it. It’s the best kind of puzzle.; So I went to the cancer centre to see Dennis and all the lovely people. They were having a little party as they do quite often. I took a plate of food and looked for somewhere to sit down. Dennis was talking to somebody, so I looked a bit to the right of him. ‘Shall I sit there?’ I thought to myself. Hmm, no. I looked further to the right. I went over there. Shall I sit on that sofa? Maybe not, it didn’t look quite right…. I turned my head further. ‘Oh, now that one looks just right. I will sit there,’ I thought, quite deliberately, almost prosaically. I settled down. The woman next to me turned to me and said, ‘I was just wondering when you would come and sit next to me, Hester.’; Eek. I did not know her. But Carole had told me about her and have been fascinated ever since. She is Margaret, the healer who has two angels with her. I couldn’t see them, but I could kind of feel them exuding a bright calm. Margaret met somebody who really needed to write a book, but was seeking help with it. Margaret listened to her and my image popped into her mind. ‘I know when I am being guided,’ she said. I was quite excited to think that the angels know about me. She gave me the woman’s number. We met to discuss the book. It is going to be great. I am her mentor.; I have been writing several things. Firstly, I finished the book of comedy ‘Sketches for Tabby.’ People have been telling me that I must do them, not Tabby. I tell them I am not an actress and they say it doesn’t matter. I must perform my own work. Hmm, we will see about that.; I participated in Nanowrimo this year. National Novel-Writing Month (November.) It was great. I am not a winner though. I did not manage to get 50,000 words down. However, I did manage 27,000 words. On re-reading, I see it is mostly crap, but not all crap. It is set in the near future in a world where it is normal for rich couples in New York and London not to have their own babies. Instead, they order their babies online and nine months later they go to pick them up. Sally-Anne is a sixteen-year-old surrogate in one of the many centres which pop up. She seems a bit of a dum-dum and is easily manipulated. However, it turns out that emotionally she is zillions of times more intelligent than most people, and during the pregnancy starts to bond irrevocably with her baby. Will she give the baby up? Will she fuck!; This story-line has apparently been done recently on Coronation Street. My Auntie told me. Oh, well, there are many ways to write a story. Their surrogate decided not to give the baby up, but a while after the birth handed it over. My surrogate realises there is something funny about the ‘parents’ of her baby (there sure is! and there sure is something funny about the baby!) and runs away before the birth. She gets into difficulties giving birth in a beach hut, so her boyfriend Duncan from Dunkin Donuts panics and….oh hang on, I mustn’t give any more of the plot away, as I am going to serialise it on here for your delectation during the month of January! Lucky you!; In my usual yearly style, I crunched the story down to one page for the Bishop’s Stortford College Short Story Competition. I think it is definitely too weird this time to get into the top five, but I had to do it, if only to give the judges a bit of a laugh.; It is great fun writing in Sally-Anne’s voice. I am enlisting the help of my delightfully dyslexic friend, Olive, although she’s gone off on her travels, damn. Of course, the story has become black comedy again. I don’t seem able to escape this genre…. Let me just say: there is more than one murder, a little bit of cannibalism and quite a lot of mental illness. My favorite quote so far: ‘How can you dispowse of a boddy with no car?’ The answer: Duncan from Dunkin Donuts makes a rarft and flowts the boddy off down-streem.; I saw that No More Page 3 were running a play-writing competition, in collaboration with Fluff Productions. They were looking for three plays thirty to forty minutes long. I only saw this two days before the deadline. However, I managed to copy and paste the film script of my Breast Book into a Final Draft Stage Play template. I then worked on it feverishly, as you obviously can’t have things like close-up shots of syringes with ‘Anthrax’ written on them, or stage direction such as: ‘Tarquin’s car swings into the car-park’ in a Stage Play. Seeing as how the plot needs fifty women to come and be milked at the farm every day I had the brainwave of using the audience as the women. ‘Thanks so much for coming and volunteering to donate your milk,’ Hetty tells them. Doing it in two days was a massive effort, but it taught me a huge amount. The main thing? That writing comedy for the stage is GREAT GREAT FUN. Oh yes. You have to imagine the scenery, the pace, the way of presenting the material to the audience. Every word, every stage direction is CRUCIAL. It’s like you are preparing treat after treat for the audience. A stage play is a tightly wrapped bag of treats ready to explode.; Sadly, the ponies are on their last legs. Here is a pic of dear Princey for you. You can see his legs get a little confused:; They have, however, enjoyed the most wonderful mild autumn and sunny winter days. I went the other day and held Siffo round her neck and sobbed and sobbed. I think I have realised it is time. They are just so old. But they are so sweet. It is just awful. The finality. Gwanny says, ‘Och, just think if it was me and Grampa in that field in the coold and the wet! You would want to put us out of our misery!’ I didn’t agree with her until the night of the big storm when we went to check on them at one in the morning in lashing rain and a fearsome wind.; In other news, Alfie is Head Boy. No, we don’t know why. We are as flummoxed as everyone else. It means we have to teach him not to eat like a Neanderthal, as he has to have lunch with the headmaster every week. We are currently in the kitchen ‘supervising’ his NYE party. Eighty sixteen-year-olds are living it up in the big room and the bar and the loggia. They are generally chilled but so far three people have been chucked out, two people are passed out and having tlc, two people have been inducing a tc, (tactical chunder fyi) and one other is about to vom but doesn’t want to. They are all snogging each other, it’s ridiculous. Oh, Big Ben on the radio, whoop whoop, fireworks, Auld Lang Syne, Happy New Year everyone!",0,1,0.1450018826043417
759,33,44,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Hi guys. I am rushing off to a festival with all the family apart from Alfie, who is partying with his mates after results day. Just thought I would check in with the blog and assure everyone I have not forgotten them, I have just been in a whirl.; Drove up to Glasgow with Tabby and her friend Matt and found a wonderful flat for next year, right in the centre of town next door to three pubs. Stayed with my lovely cousin which was a real treat. Tabby has been reading the ‘There is a Cure for Diabetes’ book and is on a vegan juicing diet. She’s become a bit of a fanatic, squeezing muslin bags of almond mylk and dehydrating carob granola. Alfie’s friend Patton came round and asked where the sugar was, for his tea. Tabby stared at him in spasm and cried, ‘Sugar is the Sperm of the Devil!’; The only sugar anyone can find in our house is an old lump of molasses which Treacle keeps getting out of the cupboard and leaving out on the gravel. It looks like a large black turd. If you scrape away at it you can get just enough for a sweet cuppa I think.; Bash wants everyone to understand that having a kitty is not always like this:; But can be like this:; We also wanted you to see this one of the wild Ithacat:; who, as you can see, is having a massive laugh.; We all love her, even Fred. He knows now, by the way. He was saying how hard it was to get her off the loggia roof and I said ‘Yeah, in Greece she climbed a tree and….’ Oops. I slammed my hand against my mouth but it was too late. He asked how much it cost and I gave him a figure roughly a fifth of the true cost. Luckily, as we know, he doesn’t read the blog, so he will never know this. He he. I said to him, ‘Look Fred, if it was a big Greek man I had brought back clandestinely, then you might have cause to worry. Come on, it’s only a kitty.’; Anyway, other than that, no news really apart from there is another Gin Club up if you want to read about Stortford’s most dangerous pub, the Black Lion! Please leave a comment at the bottom of the article about what your choice of funeral song would be, if you have time.; Grampa is coming for what he calls his ‘work experience!’ looking after the animals. No time to edit: we are off now with Aunty Penny, to Shambala for four days of fun! Byeee.",0,1,0.09137731481481484
760,33,45,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Everything went well with the Incredible Cat Transfer. The drop-dead gorgeous vet had done all the paperwork perfectly. He looked kind of disappointed when I turned up. He said everyone had fallen in love with the kitty during the two weeks she was with him including his own daughter. He could have given her away a hundred times. Ironic, really. Never mind. Once I have a plan, I try to carry it through and I had already paid for her ticket. Her pathetic little scrap of a body got transported all alone on a separate plane from ours. It was terrifying handing her over to the cargo people. We were truly wuzzed that she would get on the wrong plane and end up in Dubai and starve to death.; We decided to call her Ithaca. Alfie has amended this to Ithacat. She freaked out big time when she first met the dogs, but is already chasing them off Bashi’s bed with a crazy sideways four-pronged leap and spiked-up tail. She is exploring the house and garden. You should have seen Fattipus’ face when he looked up from his food and saw her on my shoulder. He is used to seeing Kiki the grey parrot on my shoulder, so he did a double-take and thought he was losing his mind. Like ‘shit, I swear that parrot is starting to look very much like a cat.’ They will definitely be great friends once he has recovered from thinking his food has been spiked.; Now, very important. Fred thinks we found Ithacat in the garden. Yes. So please be slightly careful if you meet him not to mention the fact she came over from Greece. I have obviously hidden the box festooned with labels such as ‘live cat’ which could have been a bit of a giveaway.; Adventures of the Gin Club part 3 is up. Beware, as Gwanny has branded it quite rightly as ‘far too rude this week.’; During the week I went camping with Janet and lots of friends from long ago, Annie, Nellen, Chrissy, Simon. We were on a deserted beach in Norfolk. Big, glossy seals keep popping their heads up and watching you with their shiny black googly eyes as you swim. You can’t help being worried they are going to bite you on the bum. It’s wild. Nellen has been there a while and has decided it is a nudist beach. She left her knickers on the sand and went in for a swim. When she came out of the water, her knickers had gone! Janet’s dog, Bug, had taken them and was trundling about, delighted with his find. Would he give them back? Would he fuck! He knew he was being a naughty boy but he didn’t care. He tossed them up in the air casually, pretending he was going to let her have them, and then rampaged off again. We will have this hilarious image of naked Nellen chasing Bug around the beach til the day we die and now so will you. I gift it you!",0,1,0.03863825757575758
761,33,46,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Hi guys. I am in a smokey internet caff in Lefkas town. The gin and tonics are phenomenally strong here. As I’ve impressed upon you before, the Greeks have no concept of shots. They just upend the bottle and conduct a zillion conversations while your gin is being poured. Then put in a wisp of tonic at the top as a teensy afterthought.; We have a little decrepit kitty here. She is a dark grey. I found her trotting along the road, mewing, blind, the last day I was here with Janet. Took her to an extremely handsome and lovely vet, who cured her eyes and agreed to keep her for two weeks until I returned. Look, you don’t have to say it: I know I’m daft. And that this is not the way to save the world. But seriously, could you have left her to defend herself while her twitching innards were pecked out by magpies? We have called her Ithaki which is Ithaka in Greek. *whisper* Don’t tell Fred Obv, and definitely not Gwanny, but I am thinking of bringing her home with me.; Anyway, thought I’d just give you a brief update. Got a text from the guy at the paper, saying that Adventures of the Gin Club part 1 had had well over 500 unique viewers and that he was very pleased since this was ‘unheard of’ for their website. So seeing as how readers of the blog were probably mainly responsible for that stunning flurry, I thought I’d better give you the link to Part 2. or he might think it was a one-off and fire me before I’ve really got going, which would be a shame as I have plenty of plans for thrilling Gin Club outings: Mellow Jazz at the Rhodes, Vinyl-swapping at the Half-Moon, the Beer Festival at the Legion. Can’t wait, and will be sure to take a pad of paper with me so the Gin Club themselves can write their own history. Yeah, like, I’m thinkin, why should I do all the hard graft? Lazy buggers think I’m going to write the blinkin score to their life. Hunh!; The Beaut (the reconstructed boob, for new readers) is doing much, much better, almost a year on from her creation. I swim in one of my heavy-duty sports bras so she does not flobble about. (Yeah, Triumph really does have a bra for the way you are.) I can say, hand on heart, I do not notice anything now, like, not a thing. I can lie happily on my right side, for an hour or so at a time. I can even lie, for about twenty minutes at a time, on my front, if I use both arms and two pillows in a gently supporting role. I can do every yoga pose that I could do before including shoulder stands. Oh thank you thank you, Miss Benyon sigh with admiration and joy if only I could see you if only for a minute.; More plans for the summer include camping in Norfolk at a campsite where they don’t mind if the dogs wander about having fun and you can have fires, and camping, again with dogs and probably little Ithaki too, in a field near Weymouth on the coastal path. By then the weather may well have broken, but who cares? Chloe, Tabby and Alfie will come back from their travels and then we’re all going to a festival, whoopee, exciting. Duncan will be at said festival so maybe more Wesley of the Wing-Mirror stories will write themselves during that time. Am also composing a children’s book, which is The Melody Blog told through the eyes of Toccata, Melody’s friend.; So, see you soon, friends. Enjoy your summer. Eat lots of things that are good for you. Raw beetroot is particularly good. Hey, listen to this: since being in Greece, Tabby has found that her need for insulin has dropped ten-fold. She’s only had to inject about seven times! What do you make of that? I have been reading this book called ’97 Ways to Lower Your Blood Sugar Naturally,’ and we are determined to carry on this work on re-stimulating the pancreas to produce beta cells again when she gets back, with a special diet called Tree of Life. So, in blates born-again mode (but do I care?

763,33,48,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"So, several things have been going on!; Firstly, ‘The Adventures of the Gin Club‘ is up and running on the local Observer’s website. This is jolly exciting. Reading it again I realised how very rude it is, oops too late now!; I got away for a week to Greece with my friend Janet. We had a wonderful time, swimming, exploring, and saying ‘It’s all about me! It’s all about us!’ We did yoga for abs! from a video of a lovely stretchy chap called Rod the Bod. Well, we call him that. He’s actually called Rodney Yee. Had an adventure with a spider called Anansi at a deserted monastery. How did we know he was called Anansi? He just looked like an Anansi, alright?; He obviously wanted to hitch a lift to the beach and came along in our car. Janet and I had a bit of a mutual screaming fit when he first surfaced on my leg in all his enormity. We stalled the car scrambling to get out and jumped about in the street flapping our tops. Anansi ran off and hid in the engine. We drove quite a bit further in terrified mode then he crawled out onto Janet’s bag. We screamed and stalled and flapped again and threw the bag far away. Seriously though these spiders have spherical bodies the size of your hand and spin web like guitar strings.; I am working with my friend Duncan on his fabulous stories about a spider called Wesley of the Wing Mirror. The other day I went with Grampa to a party, in his car. There was the most fabulous Wesley of the Wing Mirror sitting on a glorious web stretching from the mirror to my window. ‘Oh, wow, we have to stop and get a picture of this for Duncan,’ I said.; ‘Och, doon’t worry! When we get there we’ll get a picture,’ said Grampa.; I anxiously watched Wesley going Wheeeeee! in the wind just like he does in the story, waving his hairy tentacles in delight. Unfortunately my mind wandered for a moment. ‘God, it’s hot,’ I exclaimed and wound down the window. Oh bollox, Wesley’s web was ripped out of its mooring and Wez himself went flying off into the street. Hashtag Big Aargh moment. (Did I do that Hashtag thing right? I haven’t quite got it yet. Do advise pray.); Wouldn’t it be marvellous if we could get Gwanny doing hashtags? She would for sure do it ALL WRONG. I still have strong memories from about forty years ago of my brother Pete trying to get her to sing ‘Why can’t I be-e a teenager in love?’ correctly. Every time she tried she got it ALL WRONG. Every way you could get it wrong, she got it wrong. Pete never gave up though. He is still trying to get her to sing it right. Just that one line. I know, he’s very odd.; Bizarrely, Pete and Penel are both in Australia. They even met up over there. Far out, man.; Fred has gone off to Greece with David and eight lads. They slept on a Cretan beach last night. Chloe and Tabs headed off to Greece as well. I am going (again! woohoo, it’s all about me!) with Bash and her fwend Olivia on Sunday.; In more news: my flute pupil Ruby got 95% in her Grade 8 flute exam. In the Syrinx, which is the ancient pipe of Pan, by Debussy, our absolute fave, there is one blank bar where it just says ‘Be still. Contain your joy. Listen.’ We practised that bar a lot. At the end of the piece the examiner just sat back in her chair and said ‘Wow!’ Hashtag goosebumps. (see, not convinced I’ve entirely got it.)

Oh, my god, so much news to impart. I really am very sorry for having abandoned my readers. All I can say is: I have been simultaneously blocked, and too busy with life, just whirled off my feet with action, reaction, literal shizz going on man, that every time I open the blog to start writing I fall asleep.; Bothered by an unusual hygienic hankering, I ripped the carpet out of my room. Katze and Treacle and Whisky had been pissing on it for years, so it really had to go. I think even Oddly used to piss on it and she died about a decade ago. Basically, everyone had pissed on it, even Bug, who is a visitor (and a dog, not a person. No people that I know of had pissed on it.); Underneath were darkly gleaming oak boards. I dragged the bed into the corner, bunged the lights behind the headboard, opened all the windows, nicked a small green wardrobe out of Alfie’s room, shunted everything else about randomly, and hey presto, realised I had accidentally feng shui’d the space! I think I must have been guided by spirits who were fed up with our chakras being blocked. The winds now howl around the bed. It feels as though we’re hurtling through space on the wings of change or something. Cor, feng shui really cleans out your brains doesn’t it? Feels like you’ve spilt peppermint essential oil and chilli on your eyeballs.; The gin club plus long-suffering blokes had a trip to Columbia Road Sunday flower market and Brick Lane. A veil is best drawn over proceedings from the moment we caused a scrambled/poached/fried-egg-ordering fiasco in a pub to when we ended up in Dirty Dick’s Tavern belting out Dancing Queen and I Want to Break Free-hee after too much blackberry cider, champagne and guinness. I managed to buy a great mug though:; There was even some snogging (!) going on on our way home from the train, in the Brick House pub, they tell me. I don’t recall and don’t believe I remember how to snog.; Tomorrow a German girl called Franzisca is arriving, poor thing, and Bash is off to Chateau de la Beaudonniere for a week of frolicking with her mates. Chloe and Tabby are already back for the summer. I am surrounded by these prodigal peeps in varying stages of lunacy and meltdown. However, they are recovering with horse, walk, food and flute therapy. All this month, Tabs is in the choir of a West End show called the West End Men. I have been three times! Cor, check out these blokes.; My friends Sue and Gerald down the bottom of the garden say that the blackbirds who visit their garden have been singing scales and arpeggios with gay abandon and flair. They learnt it off the parrots, who learnt it off my flute pupils. Gerald reckons the blackbirds must think it’s the latest groove on the block, and are vying to be the coolest, like ‘Hey, listen to this! Look what I can do! A Minor today, maties! ABCDEFGsharpA! A-C-E-A-E-C-A!’; My hair has been growing and growing into a bush. It is now sticking up all around my head. Looks bloody stupid actually. People laugh at me in the street. Here, have a good chuckle, go on, see if I care.; I went to London to be part of the No More Page 3 Flash Mob. It was mental, yet very very sane if you see what I mean. It’s kind of hard to describe so I will just give you the link to the video instead. I am the strange person on the left playing the flute in the yellow specs. I took my flute as I don’t really like dancing. The building behind us is the Sun Headquarters. It was great fun. I would do it every day. The best thing about it was meeting all these new radical virtual friends in the flesh. And the feeling that maybe it will result in the demise of Page 3, so maybe we are making history.; The next exciting bit of news is that I got to see Miss Benyon! Yes, I had a proper appointment. I conditioned my hair and squished it down with some of Alfie’s gel so I wouldn’t frighten her. She looked frightened nonetheless. Maybe someone has told her about the blog. If so, she must think I am a lunatic of the first degree. But she would never say so. She always acts with extreme professionalism. Sigh with admiration and joy.; She asked ‘So: are you happy as you are?….or would you like me to make you a nipple?’; I said, ‘I am happy as I am.’; If she had just said, ‘Do you want me to make you a nipple?’ I would maybe have said ‘Yes’, but the ‘Are you happy as you are?’ was the crucial bit, and I got that.; She said, ‘You are a wise woman.’; I said, ‘I know,’ with a wry smile, as my wisdom has been hard won.; ‘Because it might have difficulty healing,’ she said.; ‘Seeing as I have no lymph nodes, I know,’ I said.; ‘Do you want an appointment for six months or do you just want to come back if you need to?’ she asked.; I do not believe in wasting the NHS’s time nor funds, so I said: ‘I will just come back if I need to.’ I had a sudden pang: oh shit, this was goodbye. I wanted to kneel before her, clasp her hand in mine and tell her from the bottom of my heart that she was my favourite wonderful, tremendous, magnificent person. I didn’t though, you will be relieved to hear unless you are a bit loopy-loo. I behaved. I trotted off obediently to have photos done of the new boob.; Fred is always at work these days so I can’t phone him whenever I like for trivia such as nipples nor Miss Benyon farewell traumas. I phoned Barney instead. ‘Oh, Hester, you fool!’ he groaned in disappointment. ‘You should have gone for the nipple, then you would have got to see her again!’; ‘But it might have hurt….. it might have got infected…. I might have lost the Beaut and then Miss Benyon’s work would be ruined. At least I have her handiwork, like right here, a nipple-less trophy, on my chest.’; Despite it being a farewell, the very fact of seeing her filled me with joy and peace for several days. Then Dennis came round to heal Chloe who was having a melt-down after too many flights and lack of sleep. It was wonderful to talk to him and Chloe has been a million times better since. He ridded her of a little shadowy gremlin, apparently. Dennis is a very powerful person. Next week it’s his 80th birthday. They’re holding a party for him at the Cancer Help Centre. Chloe and Tabby are going to sing. They’ve been practising at two in the morning. We even have a night-time flute trio, Chloe, Tabs and me. This is remarkable since neither of them play the flute and can’t sight-read to save their lives. They make it all up. Big LOLS, though must be said, I am the one carrying the gig.; Dennis lent me a book called ‘Dying to Be Me.’ It’s about a woman’s near-death experience while she was in a coma. Her description of a freely roaming, hugely expanded consciousness sounds very much like an acid trip. She came out of it having communicated with her father and dead friend, completely cured of her rampant lymphoma and determined to be her, to be authentic, to speak her truth without fear.; It was Gwanny’s 78th birthday on the 4th of June. We met in Walden for second-hand and junk shops. I asked her to tell me again the story of her birth. Her mother, Peggy, gave birth to enormous Bobby, her sixth child, sighed with relief and said, ‘How wonderful. Now we will have three children on either side of the table.’ Then she had another contraction and said to the midwife, ‘Ooh, that was the worst delivery of the placenta I’ve ever experienced.’ The midwife said, ‘It’s not a placenta….it’s a wee girl!’ In those days, you never knew it if you were going to have twins. So my mum fairly messed up the desired symmetry of the table and had to squeeze in on a corner, poor wee Linty.; Grandalf has been off adventuring on his boat. He is deep into the west country already, past Newbury. He dropped in on Ray and Jane for a BBQ, has done millions of locks and is a whole load thinner.; Just had the most panicky half hour tipping the contents of every drawer in the house on the floor looking for Bashi’s passport. She claimed repeatedly: ‘I lits gave it to you after the ski trip.’ With a supreme amount of mental crunching, I realised that this was lies and abominations, as I never picked her up from the ski trip, it being my birthday Baroosh mojito frenzy. Fifteen minutes before she was due to leave I found the passport in an inner pocket of a small bag inside a holdall dumped in the corridor.; Oh, thank God I have given you at least part of my news. Sorry again; lots of love and feng shui winds to you all. I will never leave you hanging so long again, promise.",0,1,0.12736428905744637

Two days of chilled times. I laxed, ported lotsix into my darsk and zorbed. I tubed healthy joococtions. I tretched in my tretching chamber, pulling zistant bands to the latest wobberrap my broze sent me. After thirty mints I frizzed my vressis, put in a quick double-colour streak with a simple orange and black stention and went out for a cutty with my friend from beauty school, Niella. She hearts to updress, and was looking fokkadokka with glittery diamond fakies bringing out her propped mouf. We tubed cakeycake, moving on to kol at about xoclock. We met up with Liza, who had tarted up her mouf with some rather exoshwerve plakkiplaits at least, thank Miley. We tubed trip voddies and became stantly runk. Obvion after that we flipped our liddergauze, tubehaled a quikpliffa each, had a good vlatt, and passed exo in a vlatticube gether. Fokka night.; Greenvressis turned up again trestot Monday. The colour was growing on me. The dye was spensive, and I realised that in the light it had a grooty urple gleam. As I was upvlombing his furls, he said, ‘It zires one last thing.’; ‘Yeah….what?’; ‘A mote.’; Onestlon, cuzmos get the zarrest ideas in their murky thortpacs sometimes. I don’t let on that they’re totallon bonksfest. ‘A mote, !Sure. !Siccathort. Might just set it all off…’; We fitted one just low the vadderbase. I put the controls in his bluv. He tried it out. !Olk, it was ackshallon fokkadokka. The mote made the vaddervanilli jump just slightlon, causing the vressis to flash their grooty gleam.; As I was waiting for Greenvressis’ likes to darskload, Talika said she was troeing exo to the corner jop. Greenvressis waited til she sappeared, then, exo nowhere, slipped a bluvved didge under his flairline and gave a sharp tug.

766,33,50,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Sorry for long rest. Experienced a blockage. The only little splurge of crap what came out during the last couple of weeks was: ‘am depleted. low. missing sun. poisoned by antibios. anti-life things. can’t be bothered with caps. got no lymph nodes to protect. irreversible situation,’ and ‘just wish the fuckin sun would come out. wish it would warm up. wish the mud would dry up. went for a walk with janet and she fell over in the mud. we are slipping and sliding around. crap.’ The winter has been too long.; Claire had long said that the next time I was due to see Miss Benyon she would come with me. We had been looking forward to this for like months. She drove me in the Mini which is always a treat. We went to Clinic 7 and sat primly in the waiting area. Claire pointed excitedly at a screen: ‘Miss Benyon’s clinic is: on schedule.’ We were fizzing with anticipation, giggling and hitting each other.; Then, oh, balls, spotted another sign in black scrawl ‘Miss Benyon is not in clinic wed 27th march. Patients will be seen by her registrar.’; Oh. Bollocks, bollocks. To be so revved up. And then so disappointed. Not FAIR.; We did get to see the lovely Lindsey. She was sweet and is a slight comfort, being Miss B’s lackey. Also got to see a very handsome doc called David. Lush. I know, sorry, must not objectify people. Not good. Smack hand.; Got taunting text later from Mad Lucy ‘Where oh where is miss b? she just went into the lift. she was here just a moment ago. her lipstick is still on the coffee cup. HESTER she is not real you made her up.’; Yeah well, that’s why we call her Mad.; Tabs is back for the hols. Has discovered that in addition to the diabetes, she has polycystic ovaries and hypothyroidism. Is a bit stunned. Says ‘I am being thwarted.’ Good word, thwarted. You can imagine Miranda saying it can’t you? ‘Thwarted, thwarted.’; Quite keen on ‘stymied’ at the minute too. ‘Stymied. Well and truly stymied that we are.’; One of my pupil’s dad, Adrian, brought me a bottle of ‘Juniper Green,’ organic gin. They sell it in Sainsbury’s in case you want to try. It’s well juniperry. Had not had a drink for a month, so necked a few at neighbour Rachel’s gin club number 2.; Ok, so it’s a few days later now. Easter has come and gone and it is still bitterly cold and snowing. No let-up at all. We keep going to bed with hot water bottles to worry about North Korea. We are wearing layers and layers of jumpers under our coats, inside. And hats and scarves.; We have some scales in the house which have gone schizo. Like bonkers. You step on them and the display flashes all through wild numbers to alight randomly upon something not even slightly resembling your weight. One minute you’re twenty two stone and the next you’re like four stone. Makes a mockery of the whole sad business really. Good. I’ve always hated scales.; I remember one time more than twenty years ago, coming up a path in early evening sunlight from Blacks Beach in Santa Barbara, this gorgeous out-of-this-world chap, looked exactly like Jesus, invited me and my sister Penel into his van-teepee combo to smoke some grass. Jeez were those guys ever wasted in that dark smokey den. They’d gone all ethereal. You felt like you could put your hand through them they were that far gone. There was a guy with long grey hair smoking a bong chuckling away softly. There was a lush tanned half-naked girl with a big spliff. For some reason the word ‘fat’ came up in conversation. She looked round and said in a really slow drawl, ‘I’m fat….’ (think ‘fay-eee-at’) There was a pause, ‘…Who gives a fuuuuck?’; It was so perfect. So simple. Maybe it was the strength of the weed, but I understood in that moment the beauty and freedom of self as an island but simultaneously glimpsed the impossibility, nay, futility of artificial self-boundaries when it’s so obvious we are all one, or something. Anyway the friction of such contesting concepts resulted in long-drawn-out hysterics. Basically, our heads was done in! We related this story to our brother Pete later that day, and he died laughing and bizarrely can still do the voice and tone of that girl so we have never forgotten it.; I never had scales in the house when my kids were growing up because I thought it might help avoid anorexia. And I have known several people who litrally bore the pants off everyone they know: ‘Oh, dear, I’ve put a pound on since Tuesday.’ ‘Ooh, I’ve lost three pounds in a week!’ Yeah, I wanna say, ‘who gives a fuuuuuck?’ That’s why I hated Bridget Jones when it first came out. All that obsessing over stupid calories. But the other day I happened upon it and read it again and I realised the author is trying to show the futility of it: when Bridget is really chuffed at finally losing half a stone, all her friends tell her she looks terrible.; There you go. Done me literary critique for the day. Back to Shardonnay. She’s not quite ready yet. BTDubs, I have been researching. Yes, Shardonnay is *whisper* based on someone I know. People say to me, they say, ‘Aren’t you worried she might read it?’ And I’m like, ‘Aha! Does Shardonnay read though?’ There is a pause and I’m like, ‘See, we don’t have to wuz.’ You know when you is safe. Like I can say anything I like about Fred, as he is never, ever, ever, ever (btw for the oldies reading this, that’s a song quote) going to read the blog. He hasn’t even read Shardonnay! And he’s even got a kindle! Hunh! Typical. If you meet him in the pub/at the Stortford Music Festival/on the Eurostar tell him off for me will you?; I’ve punished him by booking his early July flight to Gavdhos with Alfie and six of Alfie’s mates, Sammy Wammy, Lukeybabes 2, Jack, Patton, Andy, Teddy. Honestly, you should’ve seen the fuss Fred made. ‘Waaaah! I don’t want to go on nasty holiday!!! Waaah, don’t wanna go, don’t wanna go!! Wanna work, wanna do my noo job!’ ‘It’s OK,’ I said, ‘Barney’s going with you! God’s sakes, it’s only a fucking holiday!’; He should be bloody grateful I’m bovvered to book it for him. They’ll only have the time of their lives. Aaah, that reminds me of the first song Alfie wrote. It was so cute. It was about going out with his fwends. It went: ‘We just went anywhere we wanted to go, having the time of our lives, we just went anywhere we wanted to go, having the tiiiiiiiiiime of our lives….’; Things have pepped up a bit over the last week. Playing the flute helps: it expels all your stagnant air. Inez came twice and played for an hour, Tracy came and we played Mozart and Telemann duets for an hour, Alfie plays Mozart with me but only for half an hour at a time (yeah, what a pussy, says his lips get tired, aaaaah blesssss) and Ruby came every day and played Debussy and Schubert and Poulenc for an hour and a half. Also did a Hawaiian Beach Yoga video with Janet and walked several thousand squelchy miles with the dogs so we are feeling better. Also Alfie’s fwend, the charming Sammy Wammy came to stay which always cheers us up. And yesterday felt finally like the first day of spring. Boisterous warm winds, pussy willows and bonking frogs all over the place.",0,-1,-0.026348325545171362
767,33,51,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"So I’ve been resting. Cradling the Beaut who is no longer a Beaut, but more of a bruised and uneven, traumatised mound.; Still, you get a lot of time while resting to remember things. I remembered the pharmacist handing over the big bag of antibiotics. ‘This one’s better with food,’ she said.; ‘And that one you can’t have any lactose two hours before or two hours after,’ I said. I know it all you see.; ‘That’s not to say you can’t have a bit of milk in your tea,’ she whispered. I love that about England. Medical professionalism absolutely will not stand in the way of our tea-drinking.; I have been thinking about the resting thing. I have decided not to do Edinburgh. TITS the Musical will have to wait. The thing is, it’s physically taxing no matter which way you look at it. All your props, for starters, have to be carried to the theatre and back for every performance. Arthur’s Seat obviously has to be climbed! The Royal Mile gets crowded with elbows that could injure the Beaut. Also Tabby has been invited to audition to perform at Camden Festival with her singing teacher and other professionals. I have no idea why one would choose pros over our usual motley crew but there you go.; At least lying around means I can work out the morass what is Shardonnay. Here is Chapter 2 of Shardonnay and the Big Job.; Chapter 2.; So, the next day, nine in the mornin, I drove over to Hetty’s farm. She answered the door again with a baby on her boob. I hadn’t realised yet that she always had that baby glued to the boob. He were like a permanent fixture lol and were forever tweakin the other nipple. A dog had crapped in the hall. A cat’d been sick on the window sill. Another interior of a mouse were laid out on the kitchen floor. There was piles and piles of junk everywhere, on every surface.; Hetty’s crackpot team, that mildewed bunch of crusty new-age hippies if ever there was any, trundled up in a well sad car. Oh, makes me die! The windscreen wipers was goin, but it weren’t rainin? You couldn’t even see who were drivin as the driver’s seat had sunk practically into the floor. When the door creaked open, a fuggy cloud of pungent smoke rushed out like it were glad to see the back of em. Tass grinnin all over her face, Ida with her battered guitar, pregnant Sib, wasted lanky Tim and the hairy dog fell out along with a pile of rubbish. God, they start early, that lot.; Hetty’s dogs roamed about barkin like there were no tomorrow. No one even told em to shut up. Honestly this place were annarky.; Hetty had made me a little badge what said ‘Manager!’ what I pinned to me top. It felt good to have a reminder of who were in charge, because them lot needed lickin into shape. They was all fuzzy around the edges. You can’t be like that if you is preparin food. Wasted or not, I got em scrubbin their hands, trimmin their nails. I’d bought along a pile a new cloths and scourers and we got goin. There was mounds of celery, spinach, cauliflower and chard on the table what Hetty’s husband, yeah, funny beard and a bit knocked about by the weather shall we say, had bought in from his farm. I got the girls choppin it all up. We cubed the butternut squashes and bunged em in the oven. We stir-fried the cabbage. We did four curried cauliflowers in a pan. I got Sib sittin down at a side table in a nice big chair cos of her belly, preparin spinach salads, all with nuts and seeds and beetroots in em. I been cookin for me husband for years, I know what to do. And I am a girl what just gets on with it. I don’t hang about.; Fifty women turned up at twelve, looked at their diet sheets, and selected their own pacific meal. There was like ten different types set out, all of em vegetarian and well green. I couldn’t help thinkin some of them skinnier ladies could do with a nice fry-up or a roast dinner with a yorkshire pud and Bisto, but still, Hetty’s word goes. They took their food down the big room into that plastic tunnel thing what were attached to the house. At the time, I din’t know why they went down there. I were too busy clearin up the mess to think about it.; It’s not easy to remember what order things happened in neither. I just know that before I knew it, I’d been sucked in and I were well and truly part of things what before I would not of been able to dream up, know what I mean? And it’s hard to know what order to tell you stuff in. Because if I tell you something like now, then you might think it’s more important than stuff I tell you in a minute, or even tomorrow, but that ain’t true. It were all important, that’s the truth, and it will be a bit random what order I tell it all to you, because it ain’t really that well sorted out in me own head yet. Plus, bits of it done me head in, yeah, you will see why. And if it had happened to you, I’m tellin ya, you would of got your head done in as well. It were almost like I were working in some kind of loony bin. But the loonies all thought they was normal and I were the loony?! Which is quite confusin if you think about it. You start thinkin maybe you is the loony!!; So, on about day three or four of workin there, I’d washed all the fronts of the units, I’d emptied the fridge and washed all its parts, OMG you shoulda seen the sell-by date on some of that stuff! Jar a pesto: July 2008!? What is she like? Where has she been? I had the kitchen startin to gleam a little, so I wanted something else to do. I thought to meself, I thought ‘I bet some of them women don’t never bring their plates back up here!’ I went down the big room, readyin meself to give em a bit a grief, waved to Ida who were there strummin her guitar and singin with a whole buncha manic toddlers what was bashin their drums, cymbals, tambourines, recorders, honestly, she had a whole blinkin orchestra.; I pushed open the door to the polytunnel thing, expecting, I don’t know, to see the women washin fruit, blendin juices, peelin apples or something OMG anything! but I were never expectin THAT! No, honest to God, no one, unless they was potty, like gone in the head, would of expected THAT. I don’t think I can even tell you! I’m scared you might have to stop readin or it might give you a clot on your brain. Seriously though, for a moment I felt like I were in a very strange film. It’s a wonder I never passed out with the shock of it! And only then did I realise that this job weren’t gonna be like other jobs, it weren’t gonna be as straightforward as it looked. No, it were gonna be, shall we say, interestin.",0,1,0.08235080313680744
768,33,52,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"This is a picture of us just standing. You should have seen us dancing! The floor was packed. The Bollywood Night was the best fun.; So, Claire sighed crossly at me and said she had something very serious to say. She was driving me along in her new loaned bright blue Mini with a big bulls-eye on the roof (I know, a last-ditch attempt to keep reality at bay methinks) so the thrill of it meant I didn’t pick up on her tone. She said, ‘You’ve been overdoing it. You must calm down and take it easy and not get ill.’; ‘I haven’t really,’ I protested. ‘It’s just The Boyfriend and the Bollywood Night happened to coincide. And I happen to be on the committee for both of them. And it is flute exam time which involves a lot of zooming about and last-minute tweaking tis true. And Fred is away in New York so he can’t put the bins out.’; Claire was not lolling like what she normally does. I twigged she’d gone all serious. Disapproval radiated around the Mini. I felt like I’d skived off school and the deputy head was telling me off. ‘Just learn to say no,’ she said sternly.; Bugger. I don’t want to say no. I hate saying no. ‘No people’ give me the shivers. Anyway after a bit she cheered up and we experimented with the Mini’s interior multi-coloured lighting and stopped for a pub lunch.; BTW The Boyfriend was absolutely fantastic. Here is a pic of the lovely Bash backstage:; So today, Miss Benyon checked up on the boob. ‘It’s gone bobbly,’ I told her. It has, a bit like an old jumper in places. ‘Is it necrosis of the flesh? Will I have to have it sawn off?’; ‘I have seen lots of necrosis of the flesh,’ she said, gosh brave woman, ‘and this looks nothing like that, honestly.’; ‘It’s still swollen,’ I told her. It is. Bloody enormous. I had to go and buy the most humungous bra you ever saw.; ‘That will take a few weeks to go down,’ she said.; On her way out the door, she spotted my dodgily hennaed hand. ‘What is that?’ she asked.; I hid it behind my back. ‘Bollywood Night,’ I replied guiltily. ‘I had to go,’ I said in response to her reproachful look, ‘I’m part of the Task Force. They needed me.’; ‘You know,’ she sighed, ‘I get the feeling you are possibly overdoing it. Just SLOW DOWN.’; Bloody Hell. OK. I will then. I might not listen to my poor friend but I litrally will do anything for Miss B-sigh-with-admiration-and-joy, let’s be honest.; I texted Claire while waiting for the bus. ‘Miss B says same as you I have to slow down.’; She texted back ‘I should be a surgeon.’; Must admit, have been bursting into tears for no reason at all. Yeah, honestly, pathetic. I think it’s the pills. Four different antibiotics four times a day. Drives one potty very quick. And puts you off your food: for me, misery of the first degree. Had the last Herceptin today. For the first time ever, I lay down on three chairs while waiting, so I can’t be right. There was a bald woman opposite me and she was so brave and cheerful while having her horrible chemo I suddenly felt a dreadful pang of pain for her, and I started to boo-hoo again. Dang! It’s like I’m back at square one emotionally. Cue a visit to Dennis for some angel contact. Need to be restored to self.; The Gin Club turned up on Sunday morning to pick up horse food on their way to do the ponies. ‘Don’t get kicked,’ I warned Mad Lucy as she looked a bit too glammed up and mascara-ed for ponies and that sort tend to be the ones who get a hoof-print on their thigh. Judgemental, moi? Non. Pas du tout, just speaking from experience.; ‘No, horses I can do,’ she claimed. ‘Spent my teenage years down the stables.’; Even Jet-setting Jill was all wellied up. I had to head off to clear up Bollywood detritus, so I waved them off fearing electrocution at the very least.; I have a little flute pupil called Inez who has accompanied us to the ponies at least once per holiday since she was about five. Every time I would remind her that it would hurt if she touched the fence, but she never believed me. ‘It’s not on!’ she would claim, merrily. ‘See!’ She’d grab it in her fist and recoil like she’d been shot. Then she would burst into tears. I guess it’s a valid experimental hands-on method of learning. The last couple of times she has come along, (the fifth year she has been coming), she didn’t touch it. Halleluia, praise the Lord, I do believe she’s got it.; I went today and laughed because all the poo-picking instruments have been laid out in a tidy line. There is not a speck of dung in the field. The ponies look clean and fluffy and rather surprised.; I received a message from WordPress saying ‘Happy Blogging Anniversary!’ Yes, it’s been a whole year of writing. 84 posts. This makes me dribble with excitement because it means Claire’s Birthday Turbo-Pimms Cauldron and thereby Pissed Trampolining Spring Giggles cannot be far off. Oops, I keep forgetting, I am not to overdo it: repeat like a mantra. It’s harder than it looks to remember this, if irrepressibility is your default setting and fun looms anywhere nearby.; And the very very exciting news is that the editor of our local paper, who was the judge of the short story competition, has requested a fortnightly column on ‘Adventures of the Gin Club.’ He he what merry japes are to be had. I’ve already sent him one on our trip to the Cock Inn but haven’t heard back. I think due to dodgy puns (well, would you be able to resist with a name like that?) it has no doubt gone to his spam… or it was just too rude and he has had second thoughts. Anyway, will keep you updated.; Must rest now, like an old biddy! Think of me, lying there, bored out of tiny mind….",0,1,0.036073313390729105
769,33,53,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Well, things have been going on. Oh yes, we are back firmly in breast-land. I’d had a lovely afternoon sitting in Aunty Lindesay’s garden in the sun(!) and was just heading off on Tuesday evening to Janet’s poetry reading at the Iraqi Cultural Centre in Shepherd’s Bush when I realised I felt quite shivery and a bit ill. On my way out of the door, I grabbed some paracetamol, just in case it should get worse. By the time I was wandering around Shepherd’s Bush Green looking for the place, I had stiffened up with cold despite wearing about ten layers. I loved the talks and poems nonetheless, and as Janet advised, I let the wondrous Arabic wash over me much as you would let a bubbling brooke bathe you with its sound. However, the journey home was almost unbearable. I was aware that my bra on the right side was feeling tighter and tighter and my breast was increasingly feeling pain which is odd as mostly it is numb.; I got back to Stortford and had to take a cab. Took pain-killers, planned my strategy and slept. Did the dogs and ponies early and phoned Miss Benyon’s clinic. The woman on reception told me the first port of call was always my GP. I said the GP would either a.) prescribe the wrong antibiotics and I would die from a galloping infection, or b.) after I had waited for three hours to see someone, would obviously send me to Addenbrooke’s. But by then it might be too late in the day to see someone and I would die from a galloping infection.; She said, ‘Ah but! You might not have an infection, you see, so you have to go to the GP.’; I said, ‘Ah yes, but! I know I have an infection, because my breast is painful and red and I am feverish.’; She said, ‘You have to go to your GP.’; I am proud to say I have learnt some vital lessons in my life, one of them being ‘Trust Your Instinct,’ so I did not go to my GP. I phoned the Breast Unit instead. The Breast Care Nurse, Lisa, got back straight away and said, ‘Sounds serious. Come in immediately.’ Thank God.; I sat in a little cubicle in the Plastic Surgery Unit. After a bit of a look, they called other people who came and had a bit of a look. Then, Miss Benyon turned up. Oh swoon. What a delightful shock. She said I was absolutely right to have gone straight there and that I’d have to stay in for around four days for iv antibios! I was not expecting that. If I had I would have (oops I keep wanting to say ‘would of’ like Shardonnay) packed some knickers. It’s very odd to be whisked from whatever is your complicated, colourful tapestry of a life so quickly into a world of blues, greys and calm precision.; I was put back on the same ward I was in in August. I very quickly tuned into the fact that the doctors all seemed to be a) Gorjuss! b) Greek! So I had some lovely conversations in Greek about the economic crisis and Lefkada, Thessaloniki and the University there. I was put on a drip of strong antibiotics for two hours twice a day. Managed to phone Bash, Claire, Janet and Karen-at-the-ponies and organise care of animals.; Fred was in Paris when all this happened, but Gwanny and Grampa came that first night with newspaper cuttings thank God, as I was already so bored out of my tiny mind I was reading the toothpaste tube again and again.; The most thrilling bit is that so far I have got to see Miss Benyon five times in three days, once in her soft green operating garb and once in the bathroom! The first time she drew a black line around the red patch. She came to see me at 7pm on Thursday evening as the infection had spread. She had just been operating on a thirty-eight-week-old baby aahh bleeees. She drew a dotted black line around the scarily galloping red patch and said I needed another antibiotic that kills everything. She impressed upon me that I was not allowed to drink gin if the Gin Club came!; My neighbours in the ward were: a Lithuanian girl with horrendous tonsillitis that looked like it had almost killed her, a sweet woman with a massive scar on her throat with a funny jokey husband, and a mental painkiller addict. The nurses would say again and again, ‘You can’t have more, you only just had some.’ She got more and more arsey about it. She phoned her husband all the bloody time in the middle of the night. ‘Bring me some fags,’ she rasped, ‘and my painkillers, they won’t give me any.’ On Thursday they asked her what pain relief she normally took at home. She rattled off the four or five syllable names of three drugs I’ve never heard of. This would not have seemed so suspicious if she had also been able to rattle off the names of her various conditions! Thursday night she said she were gonna make a formal complaint and make sure that bitch who refused her painkillers lost her job. By three in the morning her husband had come and she stormed out. Ooh, bit of drama.; A new lady, Carol, is in her space now, same problem as me but only two weeks since her latissimus dorsi (same as mine) op, as opposed to my eight months. Her infection meant the implant had had to be taken out and put in again. She’s wonderful. As she got pushed in on her bed, fresh from theatre, she opened her arms and said, ‘Greetings, all!’ She’s a positive thinker. We get on like a house on fire.; On Friday Gwanny came with a book from her friend Lissi, then Janet with news of the animals, blueberries and a chocolate rabbit, then the Gin Club with gin (pas pour moi) and chocolate, biscuits, grapes. Joy and Rapture, all of it. Tried to keep noise down, but it got a bit riotous, especially when a woman in soft green garb turned up in the corridor and from the back looked like….could it be?…Miss Benyon? The Gin Club’s eyes were wide with excitement. ‘Don’t say anything embarrassing,’ I hissed. Then, ‘Oh, it’s not her.’ We deflated like a bouncy castle what’s had a great big needle (ooh, phallic image no doubt) inserted in it.; So, just when I thought the fun must be winding down, Barney arrived for a good old chat. His eyes lit up when he saw the Gin Club but unfortunately they had finished all the gin. Claire offered him a tonic, but it doesn’t really do it for him.; Miss Benyon must have gone home for the weekend. No one got to see her. Sigh. (Still, I want to keep her to myself really.); Oh, God, I’ve just realised something. I am bored of being myself. I want to be Shardonnay.; The antibios have been giving me some quite good visuals though. Rows of garish Punch and Judy faces with big cheeks and pointy hats. Ghoul masks looming out of grey. Even with my eyes open I look out at the grey sky and see black equidistant dots everywhere spiralling randomly right and left.; This morning, one of the drop-dead handsome doctors asked me ‘Has Miss Benyon talked to you about discharge?’; I said, with dignity, ‘We do not talk about things like that! Our relationship is far more ethereal.’; He laughed. He was talking about the fact I can probably go home tomorrow. Oh, shame. I tell you, I become institutionalised extremely fast. Love the routine of it. Love all the characters. Am fascinated by the blood-pressure machine. Love the fact the Lithuanian girl is chatting away in Russian to one of the cleaners. Love the fact Arulesh came to visit on the train. Most of all, I love the broccoli in cheese sauce and the apple crumble and custard.; Now I have made you all jells, I will give the computer to Fred to take home and go and watch another movie. Have (re)watched Tintin, Burn after Reading, Shakespeare in Love, Hot Fuzz and am going to watch Cowboys and Aliens.; (Ha ha. Claire just texted to say she has poo-picking elbow.)",0,1,0.11656067821067817
770,33,54,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"OK, it’s kind of ready. But only one chapter at a time as I get the feeling I’m gonna get sliiiiiightly stuck somewhere in the middle. And posts might not happen every day. At least I’ve learnt some formatting lessons this time and don’t fart about no more with big chapter headings. Here goes:; SHARDONNAY AND THE BIG JOB; Chapter 1.; I had to fill in a form today at the Employment Agency. It did make me laugh. I put me name in capitals. ‘SHARDONNAY.’ I stared at it for a while in satisfaction. It’s well good having a punchy name. Me mum did good there. She always says, ‘There’s only one Shardonnay,’ and she’s right there. There is only one of me. I am truly one of a kind.; On the form there were one question which said ‘Last job held.’ I thought for a minute, then, rather proudly, I put ‘Manager of Factry,’ still thinking to meself: ‘Ooh! Manager! Fancy that!’ The next question were harder. ‘Details of duties’ it said, with a little box about five centimetres by five centimetres to put your answer in! LOL. I thought back to all the stuff what went on with that job and I din’t really know what to put. Then I wrote in the little box, I wrote ‘There ain’t enough space in this here box to tell you just how much I used to …’ then I ran out of space. I know me handwritin ain’t small but God, this were just hopeless. Then I spotted some small print under the box. It said, ‘Continue on a separate sheet if necessary.’ I just sat there and had a little laugh to meself, then I walked out. Now I’m home I’m still thinking about how to answer that bloody question. One thing’s for sure, though, could I describe that bloody job in one titchy box? Nah.. I tell you, I’d have to write a bloody book to get all that in. I don’t need meself a ‘separate sheet’, I’d need like unlimited amounts of space, like as big as the universe just about. So I went and bought meself a big big padda paper and some felt tips. And I’m gonna give it a go.; Details of duties: OK then, here goes.; 1. Sort The Bloody Hippies Out. They din’t have no clue! I had to clear up the whole factry. I had to make that blinkin dirty tip hygienic! Otherwise people woulda started dyin of germs, honest, it were that bad. No one took the compost bucket out for a start, it were always overflowin with teabags and manky rottin veg. No one made sure there were any toilet paper. I mean, come on, this is basic stuff right? No one even made sure there were soap and clean towels. No one changed the dish-cloths nor put any in the wash for the next day. No one even wiped the surfaces down. No one swept the bloody floor. They was all in another world where practicalities din’t get a look-in.; I’ll tell you what they did do that lot a layabouts. They rolled up spliffs, they smoked em, they sat around gigglin and talkin absolute gibberish, and made these godawful stews with lentils in what smelt like shit. That’s about it. So that were what I walked into. And I’m telling you the truth. I am tellin it as it is. I am not exaggeratin. It were that bad, honest to God.; Yeah, thinking about it, it were a job and a half, my job.; I only took it on in the first place because Pat over the road she says to me, she says, ‘Shardie, now that Nick’s gone off again, don’t you find life a bit quiet?’; And I thought to meself suddenly, I thought, ‘Yes, I do. I do find it a bit quiet.’ Cos Nick and Gloria have not only gone off to Paris or somewhere easy to get to, they’ve only gone off to bloody Australia! And for four years I were lookin after Nick, when he were palarysed, solid, it were a full-time job, so now, I were at a bit of a loss to tell you the truth. And the job I had before that, which basically consisted of three blowies a day and passin the spunk over the road, (OK, I’m the first to admit it weren’t like that hard), kind of petered out a bit, well, OK, stopped completely is more like it, after me husband found out I’d been sellin his sperm. And you got to understand, I am a girl what likes to keep busy. I don’t like too much time to meself. It’s better to be doin things otherwise you get to thinkin too much! And no one wants too mucha that. Start goin round in circles you do, if you got too much time to do it in.; Oh, I’ve got through one felt tip pen already! Blimey, they don’t last long! Chuck it in the bin. I’ll change colour.; So then Pat she says to me, ‘Shardie, my friend out in that village, whassisname, Debden is it? No, Nebden, that’s it! She wants someone to help her with her factry.’; And I’m like, ‘What sort of factry, Pat?’; She don’t answer that one. She just says, ‘Lovely lady, Hetty. Scatty as hell though. Piles of shit all over the place. Needs someone like you, Shardie, to sort her out.’ Thinkin about it later, I saw she never answered me question! Of course, later on, quite a few things made sense. But at the time, I din’t get it. No, but you don’t do you? You don’t get it even if it’s quite obvious, cos you’re like not lookin for trouble are you?; Anyway, she took me out there the very next day to meet her friend. I could see like straight away why the poor woman needed help. For starters, she answered the door of her massive farmhouse with a big fat baby on her hip and a tiny kid clutchin onto her leg standin on her shoe. You will not believe this but the baby, he had one hand up her t-shirt and were tweakin her nipple! Cheeky little chap. People shouldn’t let kids do stuff like that. It’s rude. They should keep em under control more. But then I thought about when Nick were little and thought, yeah, it’s not that easy is it though, Shardie? It’s not that easy. They got attitude, they have, little kids. And they learn to control you. Even if you say it’s not gonna happen to you, it does, oh, yeah, it does.; Anyway, Hetty had four kids runnin about from like eleven down to one, a dozen cows and a coupla horses out the back, a bloody pack of mangy dogs, several flea-ridden cats, a load of chickens what kept tryin to come in the back door….oh my lord, I could go on! The poor woman she’s tryina run this fuckin factry but she ain’t got a clue about keepin it together. It soon became clear to me that she is a fuckin fruitcake n all. Nice, a kind lady, but litrally on another planet. And not a clue in hell about lookin her best! No, she ties back her hair with string! Yeah, litrally. String what comes on a bale of straw.; She says to me, she says, ‘The job is basically to get the team preparin eight different meals for fifty people twice a day.’; I looked around the big kitchen with its pilesa pans piled up in the sink, the greasy work surfaces, the conjeeled stove and I thought Okaaaaaay! But God, did me fingers ever start itchin. ‘Hetty,’ I says to the woman, ‘Hetty. Listen to me!’ She were tryin to run off and chat to someone. I grabbed her arm. ‘No, listen! You need to get this mess sorted out. You can’t go on like this. You need someone to help get things in order.’; ‘Well, I do have my team,’ she says in a bit of a harrassed way, draggin her hair out of her eyes and gesticulin to a bunch of crusties sittin out on a bench in the courtyard. You can see she’s exhausted. She’s droopin at the seams.; I take a good look at her team. Oh my Lord, no wonder the place is in a state. You would not believe these people. They ain’t from the real world. They look as if they have come out of twenty Glastonberry festivals back to back. Looks like they ain’t never been to a hairdresser, I bet they don’t even know what one is! I turn back to Hetty, I says to her, I says, ‘Hetty, I can come back here tomorrow with me Marigolds, and get that lazy teama yours workin. They need someone to tell em what to do.’; ‘I do try to tell them,’ she sighed.; ‘Yeah, but Hetty!’ I says. ‘You is not getting through to em! They need someone what’s gonna boss em around. And that is one thing I am very very good at, bossin people around.’; She smiled. This were when she told me I could be Manager. ‘OK, you can be the Manager then,’ she says.; I laughed. I were really chuffed. ‘Now yer talkin, ‘Manager’, I like it!’ I says.; ‘I’ll take you down the factory,’ she says.; She took me down the main room of the farmhouse and through a door into like a long polythene tent tunnel thing. It were rainin outside. You could hear the rain spatterin on the outside of the polythene. The mess weren’t no better down there. There was plates and forks and cups all over the place. Plants was ramblin about all out of control. There was like ten sofas, with their cushions all over the place and crumbs and spills. I trod on somethin and looked down and it were half of a dead mouse, with its guts on the outside! I were goin spare cos I am the type of girl what can’t see mess like that without wantin to clean it up.; I made me mind up there and then. ‘Hetty, I’m comin over tomorrow, to get stuck in,’ I told her. ‘Don’t you worry, your worries are at an end. This lot is gonna get cleaned up. All this shit,’ I looked around at it all, ‘is gonna be sorted out.’; On the way back up to the kitchen, I asked her what sort of factry it were. There were a little pause. ‘Didn’t Pat tell you?’ she asked.; ‘No, she din’t say nothin about it,’ I answered.; ‘Well, Shardonnay,’ she said, with a little smile, ‘We’re making….’ she mumbled a bit here, ‘erm…like, Special Juice.’; ‘Special Juice?’ I asked. You could hear them bloody capitals.; ‘Yeah, you know, erm..Healthy Drinks.’ She carried on quickly: ‘I think you’re gonna fit in here, Shardonnay. You’ll soon lick that team into shape.’; ‘I will that,’ I says, ‘I just wanna get stuck in and make sure you lot is hygienic, before we start cookin all that food!’ I looked at her. ‘So long as it’s got nothin to do with sperm!’ I cackled, ‘cos me an sperm, we don’t mix no more!’; ‘No, Shardonnay, I can give you my word, it’s got nothing at all to do with sperm,’ she said, smilin. I think Pat had filled her in on most of me story.; I run me finger along the greasy table edge probably with disgust on me face, I’m tellin ya with the grime in there it were difficult not to grimance wherever you looked.. There ain’t no other word for it all, it were disgustin. The disgustingness of it distracted me from the fact that I still din’t know what that factry really did..I walked off thinkin it must be makin apple juice and that from the fruit trees on the farm.; I probably should of insisted on findin out exactly what it were. Cos if I’d of known what were really goin on, I probly would of backed off right there and then. When I got all that hassle with the consequences of the sperm thing and all, I learnt me lesson. I bloody learnt what that bloody word consequences meant and all, din’t I? You might not know what it means. I’ll tell you because it is a useful thing to know. It means ‘things what happen due to what you done, and it ain’t always good.’ Yeah, that about sums it up. So, the truth of it is that I would never of got involved in something dodgy again, would I, if I’d of known? No, because if you learn your lesson, then the next time, you’re more careful. If I’d of known what that factry did I would never of taken on the job. But by the time I got to know, it were too late, I’d already gone and got meself sucked in.; Thing is though, that loada druggy hippies needed me, that were stickin out a mile high, they really really needed me. I told me mum all about it and she said, ‘Shardonnay, if they need you, they need you.’ And I thought, yeah, poor buggers, I can’t let em carry on the way they’re carryin on. That would be cruelty to druggy hippies and I am not a cruel person, I am a kind person.",0,1,0.05577010939510937
771,33,55,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Just thought I would let you know that Shardonnay is now an e-book.; Dennis phoned today to say his books have arrived but he felt a feeling of anti-climax. I told him that was normal. The anticipation is so much better than the real thing! And when you have witnessed all the little steps and struggled with every little thing, you are no longer amazed by any part of the whole. I told him to take a pile of them to the Cancer Centre and his friends there will be gob-smacked by the finished product, as they have not seen any of the little developmental steps.; I am going on Wednesday to see him and congratulate him and buy a copy for me and a copy for my mum and a copy for my friend Debbie whose brother Alan had healing with Dennis a few weeks before he died.; Our friends Janet and David have just moved into a fantastic country place like seven minutes drive from here! So exciting for us.

We had a wander round the shops and bought her some stuff in Urban Outfitters, cor what a lovely shop. We were celebrating offers of places from Royal Scottish in Glasgow and Mountview in London, whoop whoop.; Then we went to her digs. She looks out on a bank of snowdrops. Bash took photos of Tabby as Shardonnay for the cover because I can’t operate a camera for some reason. The brief was an ‘oops, what’ve I gone and done now though?’ type look. Here is a selection for you. Please bear in mind, the whole operation took less than five minutes as Bash had to get back for another costume call and rehearsal for The Boyfriend (14th to 16th March at the Rhodes! Please come!) by three pm.; Which one do you think is best?; This one is: ‘Shit. There’s a whole bunch of kids turned up at the door.’; Here is another. ‘Oops, like litrally, what have I gone and done now, though?’; Another: ‘ It’s hard to know what’s goin on, sometimes, innit? I mean, things just get away from you, and before you know it, they’re out of control.’; And again: ‘Wot, Pat? You tellin me you been exportin the stuff all this time? Wot? All round the world?’; Slightly less extreme might be: ‘What I done ain’t that bad, is it? Me mum says, Shardonnay, it could always of turned out worse.’; Or maybe: ‘Yeah, truth is, I got meself in a bit of a mess here, but you gotta laugh, aincha? Especially when you’ve had a few.’; ‘It is a hard job, Shelley, gettin it off of him three times a day!’; ‘And then again, thinkin about it, he probly would be pleased to know that his little offerin ain’t goin to waste.’; ‘Yeah, say what you like but I’ll do whatever I like with it. He give it to me volanterily.’; ‘Yeah, it don’t look like much, but it pays the bills, oh yeah. And if you need the money, you need the money.’; I’m thinking the second one might be the best.; So, The World According to Shardonnay is already available as an e-book on Smashwords to download for kindle etc. It’s $2.99.

He was right. I was very very interested. When I got home I looked it up online. It is here for you with pictures of the Lost Boys and all. I loved this bit: ‘‘The similarities are uncanny. They all share what must be their father’s hair, distinctive shaped eyes, eye colour, head shape and noses.’ Kerching!; I am quite chuffed that I must therefore once again be hailed as a prophet. Just like I were when me tits book turned out to be all coming true, when that Covent Garden Ice-cream parlour The Icecreamists started selling human boobie-milk ice-cream. Makes me think I have quite a responsibility in deciding what to write next. I could maybe try for world peace? No, sadly, for some unfathomable reason, no doubt due to a blockage in a past life, I can only write and prophesy about bodily fluids.; Quite by-the-by, I found something online today that looks truly amazing and like it is from the future. A three-d pen! It’s called the 3doodle, and I think everyone in the world will really really want one.; Fred is busy creating the cover for Shardonnay. I have gone with Bashi’s dictionary idea, with Shardie’s very own definition of the word ‘consequence‘ highlighted. As soon as it’s done, I’ll post it for you. We have also prepared and re-formatted the text, ready for it to become an e-book on a site called Smashwords.; Sorry you can’t have any chapters yet of Shardonnay: the Sequel, (it’s not necessarily going to be The Big Mojito) but I need to finish it before I can start posting. Because sometimes, as you near the end of a book, it suddenly becomes obvious what the real beginning of the book should have been and you have to rewrite it. By the end if you are lucky you sometimes find the proper title too. I wonder how Dickens or Thackeray coped with this problem. Maybe they too were obliged to finish the whole before starting serialisation.; Anyway, for anyone what cares, (and I really don’t expect you to), please be advised the sequel appears to be writing itself, driven by that powerhouse what is Shardonnay. It is already 11,000 words in and growing apace. I must say, that girl don’t take no shit from no author. Help! Am being bullied! Despite her energy levels, the work will still take at least two weeks though so steady on. I get people hassling me in the street/at my yoga/in Waitrose. All very lovely, but I do have a lot of poos to pick up in the ponies’ field you know, plus coming up the Bollywood Nights event, The Boyfriend, a Japanese exchange and a Munster exchange. Can’t just sit in bed with two dogs and one cat on top of the quilt, one dog (naughty Whisky) under the quilt, type type typing away. That would be lazy and wicked. ;)",0,1,0.13814241622574958

She got in, arranged her coat tidily around her, wound down her window and gave me a polite, controlled little wave. Her face were pinched. She were tryin not to show her disappointment. Brave little kid, I thought to meself, sadly.; I were aware of a movement by my side. Matt had let go of me arm and started forward. I turned to look at him. I could see from his eyes what he were gonna do. ‘For God’s sake,’ I said in a loud whisper. ‘We got enough to look after without a little prissy girl and all!’ I grabbed his shirt sleeve.; He yanked his arm away from my grip, almost violent he were. ‘Yeah, Shardonnay, it is for God’s sake that I’m doing this and I’m gonna do whatever I bloody like!’ he hissed. Bloody hell, not like him at all, such a pussy he is normally.; He legged it down the steps, stumbled over the gravel towards the car which were already movin away, sprinted after it and banged his fist on the roof. The car jerked to a halt. Gloria’s window slid down.; ‘Gloria!’ said Matt. ‘Would you….would you, please…’ he sniffed and sobbed, honestly, he’s a right wuss, ‘do me the favour of…coming to live here, with us?….You’re so good with Nick, you see, and you could, you could sing to him every day. He…he would really love that.’ I rolled me eyes cos he were blubbin away as he said all this. Honestly, that man! His heart’ll be the death of him. Gloria opened her car door and got out and hugged Matt. They just stood there quiet, arms round each other, tears pourin down their faces.; Then a voice behind us groaned ‘OP!’; All our heads swivelled round. There were a silence. You coulda heard a pin drop. Even the birds was holding their breath. I walked back to the doorway of the lounge. Nick were moving his mouth and eyes.; ‘OP?’ I says to him. ‘Funny word to say, if it’s your first word in four years!’ Then I let out one of me bigger cackles.; ‘OP!’ Nick said again, and me mum and me we burst out cryin and laughin with relief and happiness. Third try Nick got his mouth to work better. ‘STOP!’ he shouted.; ‘Yeah, it’s OK, Nick,’ I said to him. ‘Your dad’s taken care of it. That little kid’s comin to live with us.’ Soon as I said it in words, I realised it were right and that Matt had done a good thing.; Matt and Gloria came runnin back in. None of us could believe it that our boy were back. We was yellin and huggin and shriekin and dancin. Gloria hugged Nick. He said, slowly at first then faster, ‘Sebastian’s child. You are Sebastian’s child! Of course you are!’ over and over again.; He only had his mouth and eyes so far to work with, but over the comin days, with Gloria doin her healin on him, he got to sit up in a wheel-chair and got back the use of his arms. First thing he did, he asked us to wheel him over to the telly. I were thrilled to bits. I thought he were gonna show us how independent he were by changin the channel himself or something and you know, every little helps, that would be another good step in the right direction. Matt wheeled him over. I were just about to say, ‘Oy, Nick, you could just use the remote like everybody else,’ when he picked up me lovely silver ornamental King Charles Spaniel and smacked it into the TV, smashin the screen to bits. He smacked it again and again, every inch of it, until he were breathless. It were well weird. I mean, what had that telly ever done to him? I think the poor lad’s gone a bit soft in the head. Luckily the telly were a few years old and we was due for a new one otherwise I would have been a bit pissed off really.; Little by little he got walkin again. It’s takin time but I think he’ll be there soon. Could even be completely better for his eighteenth which is in like three weeks. Yeah, I know! The little guy’s not even eighteen. It’s like he’s lived several life-times innit? It’s all too much, really. Too much, too young.; A week later I took some letters off of the doormat and took them in to Matt in his office. He were in front of his computer. He looked at me and turned the screen to face me. It were Youtube. I just love Youtube. I sat down on a swivel seat to enjoy whatever it were. Oh my god, it were me! I must say, I were lookin well hot! I were dressed in a gorjuss gold lamay top, all shiny and tight. I were waving a glass of champers around in each hand, LOL what am I like? Wherever the camera were, I were right there in its face. I’m always like that, I am, really photojeanic. I started listening to the words comin out of me mouth. They kinda rung a bell. Oh…yeah, not good…a cold feelin of dread were going up and down me spine. I held me breath as I listened:; ‘Well, Finn, you do whatever you like, but without me you wouldn’t even be here to do it! I carried ya…well, ok, maybe half of ya… carefully across the road in your little jam-jar! I took care! I cared about ya! I din’t trip! I din’t lose ya! You should be saying ‘well done,’ to me, ‘well done,’ for doing that little service for ya.’ Oh, Lord, me voice were going on and on. Talk about diggin yer own grave. I were diggin me own fuckin canyon! I listened right to the end, me heart thumpin away in me chest like a fuckin herd a fuckin elephants:; ‘….couldn’t get it up or had sperms what didn’t know how to swim and that’s why yer mum came to the ‘clinic,’ and b.) if he had ‘provided his own seed’ then you wouldn’t be you, you’d be some other kid, if you get my drift, and c.) even if the kid made out of that man what brung you up’s spunk was ‘you’, would you really want to have a dad like that?’; I couldn’t help but nod along as the me in the video were actually making some rather good points, I thought. But oh! That bloody bastard Finn! Not only had he made out to poor Nick that Gloria were dead, but he’d also secretly got me on film the night of his show. Little shit. Sorry, I don’t like swearing, you know I don’t, but there ain’t no other word for him. I made a mental note to meself to go round and give him a piece of my mind, and a good smack while I’m about it. Yeah, and if Shardonnay wants to give you a good smack, you are gonna know about it! You can feel sorry for that little shit. Very very sorry!; I carried on watchin. Couldn’t tear me eyes away. The person what were me lurched off to the side, sloppin her champers everywhere, and threw up in a plant pot. That did make me giggle just a tiny bit cos honestly, what am I like?!; However, I kinda knew the game were up. There were no point hidin nothin now. Everyone in the world would know the truth. That’s the problem with Youtube and the internet innit though? If one person knows it, everyone knows it. And oops, that video already had three million views and had only been put up yesterday. ‘Matt.’ I swallowed. ‘ You might as well know everything now, I spose.’ I took a deep breath. Here goes. I paused and could hardly get the words out. ‘Sebastian were… your child.’; He looked at me and his eyes filled with tears. ‘I knew it,’ he whispered. I have never seen a man look more sad. ‘He was mine. I loved him. How many are mine?’; ‘I’m not sure,’ I said sadly. ‘Most of the Heavenly Host. All of the Lost Boys. Hundreds I think,’ I whispered: ‘Maybe even thousands. I’m sorry.’; My husband were lookin a bit pale and shocked. You can’t blame him really. ‘How did you take my sperm? Was it all the blow-jobs?’; ‘Yes, all them lovely blow-jobs.’ I perked up a bit. ‘Lookin on the bright side, they never went to waste,’ I said.; ‘No, I suppose they didn’t,’ he said, a bit stunned. Out of the blue he started smiling a massive smile, ear to ear. ‘You know what this means though, don’t you?’; I were like, ‘What?’ thinkin, ‘Oh, no, I got another one what’s gone in the head!’; ‘It means…..Gloria is my grand-daughter!’; Yeah, as me mum always says, ‘Every cloud, Shardonnay,’ she says, ‘Every cloud…’ and she also says, ‘If you got your heart in the right place, Shardie, you can’t go wrong,’ and I still feel, deep down, that when I carried all them little half humans across the street in their little jam jar oh, bless em, I were only actin out of the kindness of me heart. OK, I’m not gonna lie, the money came in handy, and let me live the life I wanted to live, but I wanted the best for them little babies too, I did. I wanted them to live. And live is what they done, oh yeah, not half! So it might not of turned out exactly how I wanted it, but as me mum always says, ‘it could be worse, Shardie, things could always of turned out worse.’ She’s right you know. At least we got our Nick back. And Gloria is a lovely kid, bit weird but yeah, whatever, and she got to live with us.; Me mum and Matt and Nick absolutely love her, and that is good. One last thing what she says, me mum, is ‘Shardie, everythin happens for a reason.’ And, thinkin about it, I can only see one reason and that is that it had to happen. If something has to happen, it just has to happen. Also, what goes around comes around and now you know, it’s actually quite nice that Matt’s got all them kids. It ain’t borin, that’s for sure. We got one big fuckin family! Yeah, can’t argue with that!; They come and visit him for advice and fatherly times. Like loads. It’s like he runs a counsellin service for his own kids. They have to make appointments for ten minute slots. He had to give up his job to fit em all in. That’s all right. We’re gonna claim child benefit for the ones what ain’t got no mums and that’s already a fair few. He does it all day long and even then he still don’t know all their names. It’s a bloody full time job even gettin to meet them all. So, although he lost Sebastian and Izzy, he gained a whole load more. A bit more than he bargained for, some would say! LMFAO.; Well, you know, you win some you lose some. Gotta expect a bit a that. This is Life, after all, what’s got its ups and downs. Life in the World According To Shardonnay, yeah, that’s me! Been nice getting to know ya! Next time you come round I’ll tell you about that other adventure I had after I went down Baroosh with Debs and Shelley and ended up drinkin That Really Really Big Mojito. OMG you will laugh! That story makes me die! Tara for now.",0,1,0.07835103697402057
775,33,59,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"I have been chatting to our Japanese student Miyuki from eight years ago on Facebook. She remembers everything about her six-day stay with us. She remembers me teaching her the word ’roundabout’ on the way somewhere in the car. She remembers bringing all her friends round to play ping-pong in the big room and the day we took her friends to see the ponies and they were taking pictures of the interior of the van because they had never seen a car full of rubbish and hay and rotting apples and head-collars before. And today Marjolaine, a friend of Chloe’s from our time in New York, is coming over for lunch as she is now studying in London. It is just wonderful to spend time with old friends. I will accompany her back into London as we are going to Seana’s Fans of Feminism art exhibition opening tonight. There will be a Feminist Jukebox with 200 specially chosen songs.; Here is your chapter for today. Only one more episode after this one. But never fear. I am three chapters in to the sequel: Shardonnay and the Big Mojito.; We looked after Nick for four years, Matt and me mum and me. It were not easy. It were constant. Like all the time, you had to be helpin him. But I am a practical girl and I just got on with it. You just gotta get on with it, whatcha gonna do? People came to visit Nick, they bought chocolate with em, not that he could eat it really. He could only be fed through a tube, soup and liquidized stuff. The Lost Boys came, of course, and members of the Heavenly Host, lots of em. They bought flowers, balloons, cards, and gave him a kiss, held his hand. It’s hard though, when someone don’t react! He just din’t react. Not a word, not a flicker, not a twitch. His eyes stayed completely blank. He just acted completely unconscious. You din’t even know if he knew someone had come round! So little by little the visits grew less. You can’t blame people. Obviously, if the person you’re visiting can’t move even a tiny bit, it’s not gonna be the most entertainin of visits. Matt and me mum and me, though, we din’t care that Nicholas couldn’t move, we still loved him and looked after him and chose his favourite TV programs for him.; Then one day, after four years of this, there came a knock on the door. It were a girl. A young girl of about seven. She had reddish blond hair. She were very very pretty. ‘I need to see Nicholas, please,’ she said. OMG posh voice or what? There was two people sitting out in a car in the street. I said she could come in, and she signalled to them to wait.; She brushed past me, walked straight past Matt with her little heels going click click click across the floor and went in to Nicholas. ‘Nick,’ she said. ‘I’m Gloria.’; Nick did not move, of course, as he couldn’t.; ‘Nick,’ said the girl. ‘You saved me when I was three. Do you remember? You made me better?’; OMG could this really be that Izzy’s kid? We was convinced the kid had died wasn’t we? We never knew Nick had saved her! Nick’s eyebrow twitched. This were rare and only ever normally happened when his favourite TOWIE were on so I were quite surprised.; ‘Nick! Do you know who my father was?’; Nick’s eyebrow twitched again. ‘My father,’ she said, and paused for a little moment, ‘was Sebastian.‘; Matt and me, watchin from the doorway, gasped. Oh, my giddy aunt! Sebastian’s child! So that saintly boy were the one what got that poor underage druggy up the duff.; ‘Nick, this is important. Please listen. My mother Isobel, who used to sing with you, died a month ago from a drugs overdose. I have nowhere to go. You are my only hope. I need you to look after me.’; Nick’s eyebrow twitched. The girl looked at him in despair. She put her hand on his arm. ‘Nick, please! Can’t you…can’t you just make a superhuman effort to come out of this? My mum always believed you were superhuman. Come on! I need you. Sebastian needs you.’; She looked around. She went over to the telly and turned off Britain’s Got Talent. I made a move forward to say ‘Oy! That’s one of his favourites, that is!’ but Matt put a hand on me arm and stopped me. We both watched her walk round to the head of the bed and place her little hands on either side of his head. She took a deep breath and shut her eyes. She stayed there, very still, very calm. She seemed in no hurry. The world seemed to slow down for a minute or two. I felt very sleepy suddenly, and kind of cosy, like peaceful and happy and light. Then she opened her eyes and walked round to Nicholas’ side, cupped her hand round his, and said in her little clipped voice, ‘Nick, they’re taking me off to be put up for adoption. It’s just too random. I might end up with really very nasty people. I would much much rather be with you. You are my uncle. You were my father’s friend and brother. That is enough for me.’; There were a horrible silence. Oops, I were crossin me fingers that Matt hadn’t picked up on the ‘uncle’ and ‘brother’ bit. Gloria looked and looked into Nick’s blank eyes, searchin, searchin, for somethin, anythin. Course, there weren’t no hope. We coulda told her that and she coulda saved her breath. She leant over him for one last try. She whispered, ‘Nick, if you let me stay, I could turn off the telly for you whenever you like!‘; Then she just stood there, holding Nick’s hand with her eyes shut, her head bowed. Maybe she were prayin. I were just about to ask if she were OK when she started to sing. She had a sweet little voice, like that little girl in Les Mis. She sang soft and high: ‘From little acorns, come lovely leaves, from little acorns, come ancient trees.’; Matt were grippin me arm so tight it hurt. I understood. Hearin her sing that song transported us back to a happy time when Nick were little.; Sfunny but you don’t realise you’re like litrally in heaven when you’re litrally in heaven. You only realise it years later, lookin back, when somethin triggers a shadow of it, a memory of that delicious time.; The emotion wellin up in us were unbearable. I got a massive lump in me throat and had to put me hand over me mouth so’s not to let out a big sob. Gloria got to the chorus: ‘We’re rocked in our cradle, we’re rocked in our tree, we’re rocked in our Father’s arms, and he’s close to me.’; She finished the song, stood quiet for a second. Her tears had fallen on Nick’s hand. She bent down and wiped them off with a lock of her hair. Then she turned to us and said, ‘Thank you, Shardonnay. Thank you Matt,’ in a quiet voice. We saw her to the door. She shook us politely by the hand. She looked all blurry through me tears. She went out to the waiting car.",0,1,0.0509770948573032
777,33,60,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"The next day were Finn’s album launch in the Old Vic Tunnels. Matt couldn’t come cos he had a meeting, so I went with Debs and Shelley. Bit of a wacky place OMG it’s like a rabbit warren down there. He had them crazy girls on drums, lots of em. They don’t never smile, they just bang on them drums. Havin said that, I were listening for about two minutes and I just had to start dancin! And once I started, I couldn’t stop! It were fantastic. The rhythms is like brilliant, they gets you goin. Even if you was dead it would get you goin! The words what Finn was singin was not real words, it were like a foreign language. And he weren’t really singin he were speakin a bit like rappin. He sounded like that weird Rafiki in the Lion King. A mix between that and some serious clubbin shit what you like if you done tons of E.; We brought ourselves a couple of bottles of white wine. Me and Debs and Shelley was all like totally getting into the dancin. It’s like we had tickly hips. We danced for hours. Shelley were makin me die! She were bouncin around squealin and fallin into people. When the music finally stopped we was sweatin like mad. I wanted to tell Finn how good his music were so I were lookin out for him thinkin he might come in to spend time with his mates. He were takin ages comin out. I pushed open a door under one of the arches to see if I could get backstage. It led into a cold corridor. I turned a corner, and there were Finn, talkin to Nick. ‘OMG, Finn, that were soooo good,’ I yelled. They both just looked at me, eyes all dark and nasty. I were scared. I din’t know what were up but I left em to it. What can you do? It’s lad stuff I thought to meself. Went back through the door to go home with me mates. How could I have known, see? I couldn’t of known. There weren’t no way I could of predicted what were gonna happen.; I went round Shelley’s on the way home for another coupla drinks and a fag. We had a good old giggle us girls. We was litrally screamin our heads off with laughin. Can’t remember what about, but it were makin us laugh whatever it were! I do love a night out with the girls.; Anyway, I got home and there were Nick on the settee in the lounge. He had his head in his hands. ‘Whassa matter love?’ I asked him.; ‘Mum, it’s just so, so bad…’ he said.; ‘Nothin a nice cuppa tea won’t sort out,’ I said.; ‘No, Mum,’ he groaned. ‘This is worse than you can know.’; What?’ I asked. ‘Nick, you can tell me! I’m yer mum!’; ‘The little girl…that baby,’ he couldn’t speak, he were crying his eyes out. I hadn’t never seen my Nick like this before.; ‘What? What baby?’ I asked.; ‘Izzy’s baby….Gloria.’ He gulped. ‘ I couldn’t heal her. I made her worse. She’s dead, Mum.’ He dissolved into sobs.; Ooh, that were a blow. No wonder he felt upset. ‘Dead? Oh! The poor little soul!’ I said.; ‘Finn…’ he looked up at me, ‘…Finn told me, she just got worse…and worse, after seeing me.’; ‘Nick, that baby were very very ill!’ I said. ‘You could tell. Her skin were grey! And how come Finn knows that Izzy anyway?’ I asked.; ‘She…lives with a couple of the drummer girls.’ Jesus, the light had gone out of his eyes. ‘Mum,’ he whispered. ‘Finn says people are sayin I’m a…a fraud. And that I always have been. A fraud.’ It’s like he were tryin out the word, like he’d never come across it before.; ‘Nick,’ I says, indignant, ‘you ain’t never been a fraud! That Finn’s always been jealous of you. He’s a nasty piece a work as well…not his fault, fair to say, his mum died and his dad smacked him about and that…but don’t you go listenin to what he has to say. He is one messed up boy.’; I made my son a nice cuppa tea and a rich tea biscuit. The poor lad were in shock. Never nice hearin bad news. Dead baby, not easy though is it? It’s never easy that sorta thing. Whatcha gonna say? Nothin helps. Although I did say this, I said, ‘Nick, whatever’s done is done. You can’t change it. It’s done.’ And maybe I think now I should never of said that. Because maybe it made Nick realise that there weren’t no mendin what had been done. What do I know? I’m beginnin to think I know nothin! I probably shoulda said to him what me mum always says to me when I’m havin a hard time, she says, ‘Shardie, you done your best. You can’t do more’n your best, no one can do more’n their best.’ I shoulda said, ‘Nick, you done your best! There ain’t no more you can do than your best.’ Because that woulda helped more than tellin the poor boy that what were done were done. Oh my god, I’m so confused now, I got me knickers in a right old twist.; Anyway, it’s too late now, Shardie, what’s done is done! Let’s face it, there ain’t no goin back now.; So I went upstairs and fell asleep. Oh, I don’t even know if I can tell you this bit. It’s just too bad. You won’t believe how bad it is. I’ll light meself a Silk Cut and take a deep breath, that’s what I’ll do. See if that helps.; OK, so in the morning around half nine I were in the middle of frothin a coupla cappuccinos for me and mum and I had a phone call from Nick’s London studio. They had to repeat theirselves a couple of times, cos I weren’t really getting it: Nick’d been found by some stalking press guy, half hung from a rafter by his recordin cables. Problem from Nick’s point of view is them cables had stretched a bit, so’s his feet was on the floor, so he din’t die, he just nearly died! He basically got in a coma, broke his spine, and is now like completely palarysed. The only thing what he can move is one eyebrow and that not often.; I were pretty gutted when I heard all this as you can imagine. I think I went into shock. Me mum made us a cuppa sweet tea. I were shakin like a leaf. Matt came home and we rushed to the hospital and was there for like the next three weeks. It were touch and go. We kept thinkin he’d died. He would drift in and out of conscience but mainly he were out for the count. The machines was all bleepin. We was exhausted.; It’s funny, right, but Nick still looked so gorjuss, lyin there, his blond hair flicked back like it were blowin in the wind, his cheekbones so defined, his fingers so long and relaxed. Only just fourteen years old! Still a child, but he’d seen so much. I just sat there by his side lookin at how beautiful he were, and prayed and prayed that he would come back to us. Me and Matt sat there for hours and hours every day, holdin hands and holdin Nick’s hand.; The doctors called us in to tell us stuff. They basically said that Nick were trapped in his palarysed body, but so far as they could tell his mind were still alive and workin. But there weren’t like any way for Nick to tell us that he were still here. After three months we would be allowed to have him at home and look after him there, they said.; I did want to have my boy at home. It felt right. It were hard work, but carers came in every day to help us. Me and mum put him in the lounge in his special raised bed. We made sure our massive telly were within his line of vision and chose good stuff for him to watch all day. TOWIE, Big Brother, Jeremy Kyle, Britain’s got Talent, America’s Next Top Model and that. If he did have an active brain, I din’t want him gettin bored. He could actually twitch one eyebrow, and when I put on TOWIE for example he twitched it like mad, so I could tell he liked it. ‘Alright love?’ I would shout. ‘You doin OK in there?’; Once a week we would give him Songs of Praise cos he used to like that when he were little. I think he probably still liked it. Hard to tell really. We did our best though, me mum and me. And you can only ever do your best.; If I ever went out with Debs and Shelley, cos you gotta have a break, you just gotta, Matt would take over and just sit there readin him poems, for hours and hours, one hand holdin the book and one hand holding Nick’s hand. I thought to meself, ‘Lucky the poor sod can’t hear any of that shit!’ But I din’t say nothin. What can you do? His dad were only doin his best as well. And you can’t do more’n your best.; Me mum says, she says, ‘Shardie, it’ll take time. He’s gone and hung hisself, you can’t expect it to get better overnight. These things take time.’",0,1,0.07874985193082208
778,33,61,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"So funny, one of Chloe’s friends in Boston, Emily, read the blog and thought that Shardonnay was actually my life! She said, ‘OMG Chloe, does your mother really speak like that? And your punctuation and grammar is like soooo different over there, I never realised!’; I’ve realised that the readers who receive the posts by email could easily make this mistake as hotmail cannot process the chapter headings, so in fact just completely misses them out. So you go from my day to day musings bam straight in to Shardonnay’s life. Ha ha. Although you’d imagine that a relatively tuned-in viewer would either spot the difference or figure that I’ve finished a paragraph, gone off for a quick lobotomy and come back for another quick bit of typing.; August came and went. I got meself a couple of weekends in Southend and Matt and me we got the BBQ going out in the garden. I am partial to a Barbeque but I only like steak and only if it’s well done. I don’t like none of that half raw shit.; I saw that Finn on the telly talkin to someone about music. They was asking him when his new album would be ready. ‘People are waiting, people are desperate to see what you’ve made,’ they said.; ‘Yeah, they’re like fuckin leeches, the lot of em,’ he answered. ‘I’m not fuckin ready yet, if it’s OK with you.’; Bit of a sarky bugger. He were gettin quite a reputation, going out in Camden and gettin wasted, causin trouble in pubs, gettin in fights. He were all over the celebrity news. Bit of a rock n roll lifestyle. He smashed up some lights and mics at a festival. He leapt around the stage so much it frightened me, I thought he would hurt hisself. He were like raw, that’s the only way to describe him, raw. Tiny little hips, tight black jeans, scrawny chest and them angry angry lips shouting horrible obskenities.; Then it were the launch of the Lost Boys new album. They had a big party in London where they was to play two of the new tracks live. I went with Matt. We was excited to see Nick and hear the new songs. From the first chord it were very odd. I din’t feel it much, but looking around me I saw people go a bit trancey, if you know what I mean. They all looked like they’d smoked a bit of waccy baccy, like they was out of their tiny minds. It’s like the music were doin somethin to the atmosphere. It’s like everyone had taken a step sideways in their minds, like the music had let them into a room where normally you’re not allowed to go or something. I tried to chat to some people but honest to God, they’d gone glassy-eyed. I were like ‘Hello!? Anyone home?!’ I wondered if their drinks had all been spiked.; The second song weren’t no better. I couldn’t get no sense outta no one there. Matt were backstage so I couldn’t talk to him. Everyone were lost to me. I were startin to wish I’d bought me mum with me. Then, little by little, oh my god, I started to feel it. Did I ever! I guess at first I had just been more resistant than other people. But, not being funny or anythin, this were scary. It were like coming up on E or something. It were like a mighty whoosh in your chest, from the vibrations like working on you, working on you, til you give in, you crack, you can’t take it. But then again, I never been that good with drugs. I prefer to know what’s goin on. That’s why I stick to Mojitos.; It were like a horrible tickly buzzing inside me ribs, then in me pelvis, in the tops of me thighs, I felt meself start to sway, I couldn’t think no more, me mind were suddenly full of colours, sliding slabs of colour what were floodin into corners of me mind what I din’t know was there. Oh, my God, maybe my drink had been spiked, I started to think! Parts of me long forgotten from when I were just a slip of a girl was being wakened up. I started to pay real attention. I listened and listened, and shut me eyes, and felt like I weren’t meself, I were like transported, I were like someone else, someone much better than me, someone older, but younger, fresher…oh, my lord, someone kinder and with nothin bad in them. This made me cry. I were just standin there sobbin me heart out. Because I knew in me heart, I knew that in me normal life I had been a bad person. I had done wrong. Plain and simple. It were clear to me. And I felt sorry, suddenly. Very very sorry for what I done.; The song came to an end. All you could now hear was sobs, the sobs and moanin of everyone in the audience. People turned to complete strangers and hugged them. I hugged the lady next to me. Big and fat, she were, and she had nasty perfume on, but she were comfortin none the less, in my moment of pain. I looked around me and could see that all the people there felt sorry, like me. They wanted to be better people.; I did wonder as the sobs died away and the applause started, if Nick had got it wrong. Music what makes people feel bad and sad? Is that a good thing? Music what freaks out bits of your mind what you’d rather keep under wraps thanks very much? Ooh, I’m not sure. However, havin said that, I did start to feel better inside after the song. Like as if bad stuff had been taken out of me. Like all the shit had just poured itself into the ground.; Anyway, after this everyone relaxed a bit and got drunk. There was bottles and bottles of champers, which I love, so I found a waiter with a tray of full glasses, and took three of em, one at a time, necking em right there and then. There was people lookin at me like a bit disapprovin, but I din’t care. Me mum always says, ‘Shardonnay, a girl’s gotta have some fun. If you can’t have some fun, life’s not worth livin.’ And she’s right. If I go out, I wanna have some fun. There ain’t no point in goin out otherwise, is there? I grabbed another couple of champagne flutes.; I were starting to spin a bit when I came face to face with Finn in the crowd. ‘I din’t know you was here, Finn!’ I says. ‘How are you gettin on?’; He looked me in the eye long and hard. God, that boy has so many piercings, lips, nose, cheeks, eyebrows. It’s hard to concentrate on what someone’s saying when there’s so many distractions. But you’d have to be pretty thick-skinned to miss what he next said to me, he said: ‘Shardonnay. Well I never. Face to face at last.’ He leant close and whispered: ‘I know what you did.’ There were a pause. I were so pissed I couldn’t help myself, I burst out laughin. He looked angry. ‘You may well laugh,’ he said, ‘but one of these days I’m going to get proof and then,’ he leant over again and hissed in me ear, ‘I’m gonna tell him, and you won’t be able to stop me.’; Oh, Lordy, probably woulda been better if I hadn’t been quite so drunk. But I drew meself up tall, hopin I wouldn’t fall over, and I says to him, I says, ‘Well, Finn, you do whatever you like, but without me you wouldn’t even be here to do it! I carried ya…well, ok, maybe half of ya… carefully across the road in your little jam-jar! I took care! I cared about ya! I din’t trip! I din’t lose ya! You should be saying ‘well done,’ to me, ‘well done,’ for doing that little service for ya.’; ‘Yeah, well, if you had refrained from carrying out ‘that little service,’ then maybe the man who brought me up would’ve provided his own seed to make his own baby and maybe…’ his voice cracked, ‘maybe he would’ve loved me,’ he said, desperately.; ‘Yeah, well,’ I countered drunkenly, slopping me champers out of me glass as I tried to focus on the lad’s eyes, ‘a.) he probably couldn’t get it up or had sperms what didn’t know how to swim and that’s why yer mum came to the ‘clinic,’ and b.) if he had ‘provided his own seed’ then you wouldn’t be you, you’d be some other kid, if you get my drift, and c.) even if the kid made out of that man what brung you up’s spunk was ‘you’, would you really want to have a dad like that?’ I finished my speech with a flourish of me champagne flutes, and leant over to puke in a plant pot. I were rather proud of me reasonin. I always think clearer when I’ve had a few.; Poor lad, I think he knew when he were beat. He backed off anyhow. Must say, I don’t take kindly to threats. Best nip em in the bud.; So it were a few months later and I were in the middle of pourin meself a nice glass of white wine when the doorbell went. ‘Oh lord, no peace for the wicked!’ I sighed to meself. I tell you, over the years, that front door has seen plenty of action. I opened up and there were a young lass there holdin a whingin toddler in her arms. Her face were all streaky and her mascara were runnin. She were like way too thin.; ‘Is Nicholas here?’ she asked, her breath cloudin in the cold night air.; I din’t know what to say. She looked familiar. Oh, my God, it were that girl with funny eyes. It were Izzy, the one who guessed what I done with the sperm. Shit, I never liked her. Smartarse.; ‘My baby…my baby is sick,’ she said. ‘I just thought maybe Nick could help her?’; I looked at the kid. It did look sick. Like grey. Unconscious. I sighed. ‘You’re in luck,’ I said. ‘He’s due back from New York later. Should be in about eleven.’; I don’t know why I let her in. If I hadn’t everything might of been different. But as me mum says, ‘You couldn’t of known, Shardonnay, how could you of known?’ And it were well cold! You can’t leave someone with a baby out in the freezin cold!; We waited for Nick in the lounge. I made her a cuppa tea. Gave her a crumpet. The baby were moanin softly into its cloth with its eyes tight shut.; Lucky the telly were on cos otherwise there would of been a well embarrassing silence. I finally thought of something to say. ‘You sing well high,’ I said. ‘Got a bit of a voice on ya, haven’t ya?’; She smiled. ‘Used to have,’ she whispered. A tear plopped out of her eyes. It don’t help if you ain’t got no eyelashes.; ‘What’s the baby called?’ I asked.; She took a little sip of tea. ‘Gloria,’ she said.; I woulda said ‘Nice name,’ but I really weren’t feelin it, I mean, really, Gloria? The poor little scrap, with a name like that! La di da, or what, and I don’t like to lie so I din’t say nothin.; ‘Why did you leave the Heavenly Host?’ I asked, curious suddenly. ‘We always wondered, cos you was like so good and you was getting so famous?’; She din’t answer. She just patted the baby, and I understood, she must of left cos she were pregnant.; ‘D’you mind if I smoke?’ she asked.; ‘Not at all, you go ahead,’ I said and pushed me Silk Cut over to her.; She smoked away, silently, with shaky fingers. Ooh, she were a bit of a mess, must be said. ‘At the end of the day,’ I thought to meself, ‘you only got yourself to blame, gettin pregnant so young.’ Honestly, the youf, whatcha gonna do with em, they ain’t got no clue. Honestly, to have a baby, you need a house, you need a bit of security, let’s face it, you need yourself a man. You can’t go doin all that when you is still a kid yerself, yer just not ready.; A car dropped Nick off nigh on midnight. He walked in and dropped a whole pile of recording stuff on the floor in shock when he saw the girl. ‘Izzy!’ he said, ‘For God’s sake, we thought we’d never see you again. Why didn’t you get in touch?’; ‘I’m sorry, Nick,’ she said, crying again, scrumpling a disinteglating tissue into her eyes. ‘I’m so sorry.’; ‘We looked for you,’ said Nick, looking into her eyes. ‘After Sebastian died we tried all your old addresses.’; ‘I was only fifteen, Nick! The press would’ve done me in! Oh, yeah, you know what they’re like. They would’ve loved a pregnant celebrity teen. My parents knew I had to disappear….’ She looked down at the baby who were suddenly breathing very fast. ‘Nick, can you help her? You’re her last chance. Please.’ She held out the floppy toddler to him, her head down in shame.; Nick turned off the telly and took the kid, wrapped in its fleecy blanket, in his arms and walked over to the window. With his back to us, we couldn’t see what he were doing, but he stood really still. The orange glow from the street lamp outside shone around his body. It looked like he had a halo all around him. He hummed really low in his throat and swayed slightly. He stayed like that for maybe three minutes. Then he turned and passed the baby back to the girl. The baby were asleep, its eyes shut and a frown on its little grey face. Poor little mite.",0,1,0.0039285661707233
779,33,62,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"I have been thinking about the cover for Shardonnay. Little wriggly sperm swimming around of course, and (Bashi’s idea) a dictionary, open at the word ‘Consequence,’ which will be highlighted. But the definition shown will be in Shardie’s words, so for example: ‘Somethin what happens due to what we done, and it ain’t always good.’ So, homework for this week, chaps: define ‘Consequence’ as you think Shardonnay might. I will use the best one on the real cover.; Dennis’ book is at the printers! Really excited we both are. The publishing company, Pen Press, designed him a wonderful purple cover, with a spirit in a cloud. When it is ready I will let you know.; The next day, I turned on the telly at about seven in the morning. I screamed, ‘Mum! Come here! Have a look at this! You not gonna believe this!’; The cameras was not at the camp no more. No, they was following Nick who had his backpack on and were leaping down the hill over the rocks. The only person who’d managed to keep up with him were that grumpy Lost Boy, Finn and a couple of half-dressed cameramen. The cameras was bumping around, as the path were not smooth.; ‘Oy, Nick, where are you going?’ asked the cameramen, breathless they were and tryin to button up their jeans.; Nick din’t answer them. It were as if he never heard em. He were talkin with Finn. You couldn’t hear what they was sayin, but they never stopped talkin and, it sounded like, singin. It were like a mini battle of two voices.; The path opened out onto rough scrub-land. A wide moor stretched ahead. The two lads faced each other, nodded and carried on walking but their paths split. All the people runnin after em stopped in confusion. Their heads went both ways, then they chose a way. Most went with Nick, but some went with Finn. Some of the cameras went with him too. As he walked he ripped off his furry hood, left it on the heather. He pulled off his blue coat and dumped it. Underneath he were all in black.; Me mum could see I were upset. She said, ‘Shardie, they gotta go their own way. Everyone’s gotta find their own path in life, no good followin someone else’s, you gotta find your own.’ I thought, she’s right, they’re different kids, different situations. You can’t fit a round peg in a square hole. They ain’t lived the same life, they gotta find their own way.; Our screen followed Nicholas. If you wanted Finn you could change channel. Nick got to a road, turned left, walked into a little Italian town. He asked one of the film crew manager people if he could borrow their phone. We watched him talkin on the phone. Next thing we knew he were picked up in a sleek grey car and he and his core of Lost Boys, minus Finn of course, was whisked off. The commentators was having a field day! It were like that day the Twin Towers fell down and none of the commentators knew what the blazes were happenin? They was falling over theirselves with their little theories what went nowhere. And there were a big ol scramble with the press trying to get hold of vehicles so’s not to let em get away, as they’d probably be fired if they let the biggest story of the decade get past em.; The telly were all of a buzz about Finn breakin away from the Lost Boys. None of the Lost Boys had ever left before, except of course, Sebastian, but he never chose for that to happen. There were only that one girl, Izzy, who had left the Heavenly Host cos she couldn’t handle the pressure of the fame. Fans was grievin, as you do when your fave band loses a member like remember when the Spice Girls split up? And Take That? Horrible. Nick din’t seem too worried though. He apparently got on a plane to New York. They was in a recordin studio with the same producers what made ‘Little Acorns’ with them, working on the new sound.; Finn had come back to London with around thirty of the Heavenly Host. He went to a place in Camden, also to do some recordin. He rented a massive old house and got a band together out of his followers. There were a big chap on bass, a skinny drummer with long spiky hair, a crusty guitarist, and Finn on vocals. And this were genius: there was also about ten girls, all with black nails, black lipstick, blank eyes, not a single smile between em, and big big drums. They just pummelled them drums like their lives depended on it! They was big news. See, they had the sound of the Lost Boys and a bit of the fame and allure of the Lost Boys, but they was taking it in altogether a new direction. Yeah, girls, basically. Lost? Yeah probably! Matt’s kids? Let’s just say, they had the look, so again, yeah, probably.; Some of the words what came out of that boy’s mouth though! Ooh, wash out yer mouth son! It were like, oh I can’t even say it, it’s too dirty: ‘f*** your mother in the c***, f*** her, f***her,’ and the like! Me and me mum would sit there on the sofa with our hair litrally standin on end. Frankly shockin! But guess what? People was flockin to them gigs. They was spillin out onto the street. People couldn’t get enough. The band were edgy see. They was angry. And all the edgy angry people out there was pickin up on the new vibe.; Within a month they was being interviewed on Jules Holland. Jules asked them what everyone wanted to know which was why was they so angry? Finn flared his mega-pierced nostrils, not in a good way, and said, ‘some people manage to deal with loss and pain by looking at all the positives, like all the things they’ve still got. But all this positive shit….you know, I’ve like had enough of all that new-age hippy crap?’ He leant forward and in a coarse whisper and with a sneer of his multiple-pierced lip said, ‘Life is full of shit, people! Get used to it.’ He gave a grin, again, not in a good way.; ‘What shit happened to you then, Finn?’ asked Jules.; There were a pause while Finn’s eyes looked up like he were asking for patience from the Lord!; He sighed. ‘Where to start? The person I thought were me father, he wanted me dead? Me mum died when I were ten? Me real father don’t want to know….what more do you need? Half of me brothers have gone all soppy and religious, like losing their minds? No, it’s time to make a stand. See if I can save the other half from turnin to mush.’ He gesticuled to his followers.; ‘By ‘brothers’, do you mean the Lost Boys?’ asked Jules softly.; Finn twisted his face in a bit of an ugly way. ‘Yeah. They’re my brothers,’ he said.; ‘So at Christmas, will you be up against your ‘brothers’ for the Number 1?’ asked Jules.; Finn laughed. ‘Yeah, I’m up for thrashing it out with them, why not?’ he said.; The next week he went into a recording studio with his band and twenty of the Heavenly Host. They stayed in for more than a month. No one heard a peep out of them during this time. The tension were unbearable. What sort of a sound was they making? Everyone wanted to know. Little clips of them on Youtube from the several angry spittin gigs with them crazy blank-eyed drummer girls went viral. People was gaggin for more.; Equally, Nicholas had gone quiet. He were recordin in New York. We went over to visit just for a long weekend. It were well hot and humid, but I thought I might check out Fifth Ave while I were there, did meself a nice bit of shoppin at Barney’s and Macy’s. We took Nick out to a diner for eggs on toast, always his favourite. He were well distracted but that weren’t nothing new. Couldn’t get much sense out of him. I asked him if he’d been shoppin since he’d been there. He just looked at me like what’s shoppin? I sighed. While I were there I brought him some nice Calvin Klein underwear and jeans and a couple of trendy t-shirts from Canal St. I mean, not being funny or anythin, but a guy needs some clothes. He didn’t need much heavier stuff as it were boilin hot that summer.; Anyway, then I needed to get back. It were me mate Shelley’s birthday and we was going to the Ice Bar in London in a limo to have drinks in them big coats. I’m never one to miss a party, you know me, and I told Nick not to worry, I’d be watchin out for him on the telly. His dad stayed out there another week just to help him with practical things, make sure he were getting enough to eat and that.",0,1,0.0353703926824044
780,33,63,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"So I have managed to confuse everybody by missing out Part 10, only in title though so you have not missed any of the story. Well done, Dave in Indonesia, for spotting that. To rectify the situation, I have changed what was Part 11 to Part 10, and changed Part 12 to Part 11 and now this one is Part 12. OK? All hunky dory. (Don’t get yer knickers in a twist, it don’t make no difference to the story, says Shardie.); It is blizzarding away outside. Got in trouble for imagining a snow day (SNOWDAY! Yay! Yay! You can picture us leaping about in delight) when there was none, oops (our school is quite hard-line on this) a couple of weeks ago, so we have to get up and go any minute now.; News of Tabby: she went up to Glasgow for a recall at Royal Scottish. Stayed with my cousin Phoebe Meg and went out on the town with Lucy and Max. Had a real ball. News of Chloe: she is snowed in in Boston and had to cancel her gig. News of Alfie: he has been writing his Japanese speech. News of Bashi: she enjoyed meeting Ed Drewett at a rehearsal for The Boyfriend and got to try on some stunning costumes for the show including a twenties spotty swimsuit with bloomers and matching feathered head-band.; I know some of my readers like a bit of Shardie with their morning coffee so I must not delay. Here we are. The real Part 12.; So I were alone at home, with me mum. We just ate pizza and watched that screen. Then one night, I were not sleepin well, must be said, I had a well strange dream. I saw Sebastian, very still, very clear, in front of me. His eyes looked me right in my eyes and he said, ‘I forgive you.’ I felt a wave of peace wash over me. ‘You knew not what you were doing,’ he said, calmly. ‘And if it weren’t for you, I would never have lived.’; I watched him as he stood there. He had a robe on, which were billowin in the wind. He held out his arms and I saw Nicholas comin towards him, and they embraced. The Heavenly Host were behind them, singin. The song made me flesh creep. It were not from this world. It were of new harmony things what people have not discovered yet. I can’t explain, but it made me shiver, not with horror but with excitement.; I spoke to Nicholas on the phone the next day. ‘Nick,’ I says, ‘I saw Sebastian in a dream. He were givin you a hug. The Heavenly Host were singin new stuff.’; ‘Oh, thank you Mother,’ he replied. ‘Yes, he’s looking after me. And I know what the new material is. I’m formulating it as I go. Sebastian’s teaching me from the other side. It’s coming to me, I can feel it.’; ‘Oh, well, good lad,’ I replied, faintly.; On the telly you could see him singin. His companions was singin too. Sometimes, walkin along, he would turn to them and instruct them, tell them what to sing. Then you would see them tryin again, and Nicholas would be noddin away. It were amazin. There was whole teams of commentators takin over from each other all day. There were a whole channel devoted to me son. I just din’t know what to make of it. I were well and truly flummoxed. Me mum she said, ‘Shardie,’ she said, ‘We’re not meant to know what’s goin on, really. Sometimes you just don’t know, and we’re just not meant to know.’; Day after day, Nicholas walked. He covered about twenty to thirty miles a day. We just din’t know what to make of it, but we settled into a routine with our cups of tea in front of the telly. One day the Social came round to talk about Nicholas. The lady were a bit of a scream with her grey hair and bobbly jumper. She started tryin to tell me that it would be better for Nick to come home and do his studies, ‘You must remember, he’s only twelve, Mrs Stern,’ she said, but she ended up just sittin on the settee and watchin him walk with us. She even dipped into the popcorn! It weren’t really helping her case that in the twenty minutes we sat there we saw him talkin French to a bloke on a bike and Italian to an old lady what gave him a bun and he taught a whole new song to his gaggle of followers. ‘This kid don’t need no studyin!’ I said to her. ‘He already knows everythin!’; In the end she sighed, the lady, and said, ‘What do we know anyway? He seems to know more than us about life. Maybe we shouldn’t interfere.’ She could see full well that he were bein looked after. The older Lost Boys was runnin along beside him, and the managers and producers of their songs had cars tailin him. The teams of cameramen was kind to him, you could see. He chose little back roads and lanes, so it weren’t like he were gonna get run over by a lorry. He weren’t lackin for food, neither. The roads was lined with people offering him home-cooked goodies and lemonade. He would accept them but he never stopped walkin.; Eventually, after about a month of this, seemed like for ever, but we din’t miss a minute of it, Nicholas reached a wood in the North of Italy. He stopped for the night. Everyone saw him go into his tent. In the mornin he came out, stretched, and smiled, I think, for the first time since Sebastian died. He looked around at the pines, the banks, the meadow and the gurgling stream. ‘I’m staying here,’ he said. ‘The spirit is here. There is no more need to move onwards.’; He spent the rest of the day creating a shelter out of bendy twigs. Someone bought him along a tarpaulin which he stretched over his construct. A local huddle of women bought him a carpet which he laid out on the pine needles. One of his companions made him a little table out of logs. His dad, who had been part of the band of followers for a few weeks by then, handed him a little camping chair. Nicholas put it at the entrance to his shelter, and sat in it, baton in hand and closed his eyes. The camera just stayed on him. The birdsong came over, the creakin of the forest, the hootin of an owl. You could see bats start to flit about, and glow-worms shinin their little lights. And Nicholas just sat there, mediatin like what them gurus do.; It were the most peaceful TV ever. And Honest to God, it weren’t borin. I could sit there for hours with me mum just watchin him. It grew darker and darker on the screen. Nicholas’ friends gathered twigs and branches and lit a fire. We could see their faces reflectin orange in the firelight. You couldn’t hear what they was sayin, just hear a muffled conversation goin on.; The next morning, mum and me we stumbled towards the telly in our dressin gowns. Turned it on. There was about seven tents now. Lucky it were already April. The dew had fallen on them tents and were glistenin in the mornin sun. It looked magical to me. Like a fairy glade. Nicholas were sleepin still. One of his friends had fallen asleep by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. Oh, no, not a friend, when he turned his head, I saw it were his dad. Aaaah, bleess. I guess he forgot his tent. The sun were still red, and castin a reddish glow over everythin. The pines was dark green, almost black and still.; A soft humming started coming from Nicholas’ tent. It were gentle, so soft and lush it were I can’t tell you. The blokes with the cameras, the commentators, the friends, all was lookin at the tent, listenin hard. They all looked a bit like bedazzled, like they was hypnotised or somethin. People settled down on the pine needles, and waited all solemn like, for Nicholas to appear.; One of his friends made him a cuppa tea on the fire and passed it in to him. I were glad about that. I might not have been the best mum but I always liked to feed the boy and keep his little tummy happy. Some Italian woman turned up with a brioche thing, like a plaited loaf, and that were handed in to him as well.; Then, after about an hour, out he came. He only had shorts on. He looked refreshed, his eyes was gleamin, he looked fantastic. He looked at the people sitting there, and smiled. More people was comin all the time. Italian women, men, children, all gathered silently and sat down amongst the trees. Nicholas opened his arms and started to sing. It were a low song, calm and assured. He told a story in his song, a story of a boy who did not know where he had come from nor where he were goin. It were beautiful. Me and me mum cried buckets. The audience there were all cryin buckets too. People had begun to realise that Nicholas did not speak much any more, he only sang.; I began to feel more and more like I had played a part in this story. I hadn’t thought it were an important part but I were beginning to see maybe it were more important than what I had thought.; So the next day there were a steady stream of people coming up the hill to see the boy. A right weepy lady in a beautiful purple coat (I wondered if it were from Prada cos that’s Italian innit?) surrounded by weakly wailing relatives and a priest carried her ill child to him straight from the hospital. OMG were that baby ever sick! Horrible yellow colour. Yellow and bloodshot whites of the eyes. One mass of floppy limbs. Yuk, not good. I weren’t holdin out much hope for it, really. I mean, there weren’t much you could do. It were on the way out. Bit of a no-brainer. Sorry, but some situations, you just gotta say, there ain’t no comin out of this one, matey.; Nicholas took the baby in his arms. He stood very still, took a deep breath, shut his eyes. There were an odd silence in the woods. Weird. Almost like time had stood still for a little minute. He passed the child back to the mother. She babbled thanks, wrapped the child in her purple coat and scurried off down the rocky path.; A family bought their grandmother what were coughing her guts up. Nicholas placed his hands on her achin shoulders. He shut his eyes and again you could see that strange concentration about him. Other worldly it were.; That grumpy boy Finn had set up camp over on some rocks. He had some of the edgier chaps and a bunch of girls from the Heavenly Host with him, they was singin, and drummin, and some of em was laughin and smokin.; People turned up all day all that week. On the Thursday we was sitting on the sofa with our popcorn, like wondering how Nicholas were gonna cope, there were such a queue building up to see him. People were sat in huddled groups all around. Nick spoke with hundreds of people in turn. It got later and later. Dusk started to fall. I felt worried for Nick, cos he’d been working so hard for hours and hours.; Matt and some of the Lost Boys was cooking a vegetable soup in a big pot over the fire. Nick finally finished workin with a little girl who seemed to have some awful thing like Leukaemia or somethin. He came over to the fire. He looked absolutely knackered. Matt passed him a bowl of soup. Nick looked at it, then he looked around him. He walked over to a miserable lookin tramp what were sittin against a tree. ‘Here,’ he said, ‘Eat.’; The Lost Boys started handing out food to all the people. ‘Oh, no,’ groaned me mum, ‘We ain’t gotta start feedin the bloody tramps now, ave we?’; I were scared they wouldn’t have enough for everyone and me boy wouldn’t get nothing, but people started rummagin around in their bags. The Italian families started gettin out some bread and pots of olives, ugh don’t see what people see in olives meself, someone had bags of tomatoes and peaches. The cameramen pulled a massive cheese out of their huge black bag and carved it all up and took pieces around. The groups of kids what had come trudgin up the hill got out big slabs of chocolate what their mums had given em. Mmm. The feast, apart from the olives that is, looked good even from here! Even better than our popcorn and ice-cream to tell you the truth.; The people ate and ate and laughed and drank. The atmosphere were like infectious! I phoned Debs and Shelley and got them to come over and have some Margaritas with us. I say some, I mean quite a few! We only had about seven each! Debs hadn’t been to work for a whole two weeks she’d got so addicted to watchin Nicholas. Shelley’s OK, cos at her work, she’s a hairdresser, they have the TV on all the time so she don’t miss any.; We watched telly together till all the people had gone off or settled down in the firelight.; The next day, the first people to come up the hill was only that lady in purple – maybe it were Dolcie and Gabbana that coat? just by the way it were hangin you could tell it were expensive – with the priest and all her family with the yellow dyin baby. ‘Oh, no, ere we go,’ said me mum. We all watched them approach in a scared silence. OMG, I thought to meself, they’re going to have brung the body for Nicholas to do a blessing. I don’t like bodies of little babies. It’s just not right, is it? I hid me head in the cushions and just peeked out a tiny bit I were that scared. Me mum held me hand. The lady looked Nicholas in the eye. She looked very serious. She opened up her coat. Ooh, you could see the mauvey satin lining, lush. The baby looked out. She weren’t dyin no more. She were bright and sparkly, bouncin on her mother’s hip, wavin a squeaky giraffe.; Then the priest and the family and the lady all bowed down before Nick, like kneelin there in the damp pine-needles with their heads down. He held their hands. The granny were like strokin his feet! I thought how odd it were, I mean, he were only my little lad what liked to make a mess with his paints and what used to ask for soldiers with his boiled egg, know what I mean?",0,1,0.055141478485776704
781,33,64,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Basically what happened next is well sad. I’m telling you that because you might go all teary and you might wanna get your tissues at the ready. It makes me all teary just rememberin it all. But me mum says, ‘there ain’t no good gonna come of pretendin it din’t happen, Shardonnay. You gotta accept when something happens that it’s happened. You can’t change it, cos it’s happened, it’s in the past.’; Sebastian got shot. Out of the blue. Some crazy fan on masses of medication for schizophenia heard voices and that tellin him to kill him. Just got hold of a gun, bought a ticket for a concert, sat in the front row and blasted him in the forehead in the middle of their biggest hit: ‘From Little Acorns.’; We was all devastrated. We was in shock. The whole world were. No one could get over that. Sebastian were still so young. He were only twenty six. Too young to die in anyone’s book. He were so pure and beautiful. And this is the saddest thing of all: he never really found what he were lookin for, did he?; I felt bad after this happened. I realised I were in up to me neck. I realised that I should of said something. Sebastian should of known who his father was. I should of told the truth. He should of had a father. Shit. Too late now, Shardie. One of the things about life is, you can’t turn the clocks back.; I din’t sleep that night, the first night after he died. I din’t know what to do. In the mornin, I bought Matt a cup of tea, sat down on his side of the bed. I so badly wanted to tell him, but I just couldn’t. I were afraid he would hate me and leave me if he knew the truth.; He slurped down his tea, then shut his eyes again and slept. He moaned softly in his sleep, surfin waves of grief. Tears squeezed out of his shut eyes.; Nicholas had come back home to his room, hit hard by grief. We could hear his hard rackin sobs through the wall. He had loved Sebastian. Sebastian were his teacher, his role model, his friend. Oh shit, thinkin about it, he were his blinkin brother too, I spose.; At around eleven in the morning the sobs stopped. We heard occasional bumps and thumps. Then Nicholas came out of his room, dressed in many layers, with one of Matt’s rucksacks on his back and Sebastian’s white baton in his hand. ‘I’m going off,’ he said.; ‘Nicholas,’ we protested, ‘you’re only twelve. You can’t go off.’; He looked at me. ‘Mother. Goodbye,’ he said, but politely, not in a rude way. And then he started walkin. And walkin. We ran up the road after him. A photographer who had been waiting outside the house followed, snappin him. Nicholas refused to stop. He sang softly at first, then more lustily. A couple of teenagers joined him, singin along. By the time he reached the park down the bottom of the hill he had six or seven followers. People was dropping everything and running alongside. By the time we got to the outskirts of town there were a whole crowd. Nicholas stalked along at the front, tireless, frowning, singing and waving that bloody baton. A press car drew alongside, massive cameras pokin out the windows. ‘Where are you going, Nicholas?’ asked the journalists.; ‘It doesn’t matter,’ he replied. ‘I am on the move, that’s all. On the move, until I feel better.’; The followers took shifts, hoppin on buses and that to keep up. Nicholas just kept going. I had to stop and come back home. I were out of breath. Shouldn’t smoke so many fags. Din’t matter, I could watch him on the telly. At nightfall he put up a little one-man tent he had in his rucksack and crept into a sleeping bag. Six hours later he were again on the move. His shoes wore out. People bought him new ones. He never had to worry about food. People handed it to him in the street. Crowds now lined the streets, waiting for him to pass by. People chanted for him. The telly devoted a 24 hour channel to him.; I found the whole thing quite exhaustin. The power of the little guy were quite extraordinary. Me mum and me we watched most of it on the telly. Me mum said, ‘There’s no stoppin im, Shardie. Sometimes you just gotta let em go. No sense in holdin em back. You just gotta let em go.’ She’s right you know. Sometimes you just gotta let em go.; I just felt it were strange, but fittin, in a way, that I had now lost me boy. And that feeling of loss were not unfamiliar to me, know what I mean? And I thought how, really, we’ve all lost somethin, we’re like born like that, none of us feel complete, do we? I mean, look at Nicholas. He had his dad, but he’s still one of them, one of them Lost Boys, inne? And I cried because I wondered suddenly if it were his mum what he felt he didn’t have. Like, had I been a good enough mum to him? My mum hugged me. ‘Shardie,’ she said, ‘You been a great mum to Nick. That’s how he’s so brave that he can go off like that!’ She made me some popcorn to cheer me up.; The TV came round to me house to see what I had to say about it all. I put down me popcorn and shoved me face right into that camera. ‘Go it, Nicholas!!!’ I yelled at the top of me lungs. ‘We’re all behind ya!!!! Don’t know where you’re goin, but we don’t care, do we Nan?’ I laughed and pointed the camera at me mum.; ‘Go On Nick!!!’ she screamed. ‘You can do it! We believe in ya!’; ‘Just send us a postcard when you get wherever it is you’re goin!!’ I yelled. ‘Alright?’ I waggled a finger at the camera.; Nicholas reached the coast. He bought a ticket for the ferry. Went across to Cherbourg. As soon as the ferry got to the other side, there he were again, on our big screen, walkin and walkin. There were a whole scrummage of people walkin with him now. They kept tryin to talk to him, but all he would do was sing Sebastian’s songs and clutch that baton with a white-knuckled grip.; My mum said ‘He’s upset, Shardie. When someone’s upset, there’s no tellin what they’ll do. And I’m tellin ya, he is one upset little kid.’; We gazed at the screen, at his little face, his little limbs goin. He seemed determined but in such a calm way, like he knew he had to do this from some other knowledge. Lookin at him, I realised I wanted to feel like that, I wanted to be like him. I think everyone in the world, watchin him, would want to be like him, to not care where they was goin, but go there anyway type thing.; Matt had not gone back to work since Sebastian died. He were just watchin telly with us all day, big bags under his eyes. Suddenly he stood up. ‘I’m going after him,’ he said.; Me and mum just looked at each other. ‘He’s a man, Shardonnay,’ said me mum. ‘Sometimes a man’s just gotta do what a man’s gotta do.’; He packed a bag with a few things, a coupla changes of clothes. And off he went in his car over to France to follow his son.",0,-1,-0.015326504128587463
782,33,65,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"I went to the Bishops Stortford College Short Story Award Presentation. The judge, the editor of the Bishops Stortford Observer, was very funny. He said that although his business is to do with words, he is often constrained to tackle subjects such as the latest meeting of the cemeteries committee, so he looks forward to a bit of light relief from the short stories. Unfortunately, no light relief is to be had as the adult section is full of doom, depression, destruction and a ridiculous number of bodies. He said that each year he has no sooner recovered from reading them than it is time to judge another lot. This year, the number of stories in our section had increased slightly, and the body count had gone down slightly.; It was wonderfully inspiring, with the stories of the winning Year 2s being read out, and Years 3 – 6 and Years 6-11. Great to see that creative writing is alive and well within the youf. I was not holding out much hope for my story, for obvious reasons, but I was clinging onto a tremendously thin sliver of likelihood that it could win. But no, I said to myself: it is just too rude. It was like in The Incredible Journey, when the bouncy young dog has just made it home, and the cat Sassy has come home, and they are being cuddled by their kids, and the boy is looking out over the plain and saying, ‘No, he was just too old. He could never have made it. He was just too old.’ And we know the poor dog is stuck in a pit, like a mile away, and there’s no way out. The boy looks and looks in vain, then turns away, gutted. This is when the big old dog appears in the distance, muddy, thirsty, bleeding, limping along. So I felt my story heave itself out of the pit and appear on the horizon, when the judge said, ‘The prize goes to Hester Tingey for her vision of a clone-infested Bishops Stortford!’ He joked about how the story boosted business with my mentioning of The Rivers, Baroosh and The Fountain. I got a plaque! and a certificate and a book and a twenty five quid book token!; And you know, it was all because of that line you had to fit into the short story: ‘Anyone could make that mistake once. But then he did it again,’ (a line chosen by author Morris Gleitzman on the other side of the world) that got me started on the idea of what sort of shape revenge could take and thus the whole of this Shardonnay thing! What a remarkable stimulus just one line can be.; So the Heavenly Host were on ‘Later with Jules Holland’. Suddenly their spokesperson always seemed to be our boy. Nicholas, dressed in the choir’s lovely blue fleece with the furry white collar and cuffs, stood straight and still. ‘What is it like being so young and yet so famous?’ asked Jules.; ‘Fame does not interest us,’ said Nicholas. We was on the edge of our seats. ‘I am only interested in singing. When I am singing with my group I feel free. It’s like I am out of my body.’; Jules’ jaw litrally dropped to the floor. ‘What would you say was your motivation for doing such a great world tour?’ he asked.; ‘When we are raising our voices together we are as one,’ said Nicholas. ‘It matters not from where we have come. It matters not where we are going. We are in the moment. Engaged and thereby free.’; Remember this little fella is only like ten years old. Me and Matt was just like starin at one another. What the fuck had got into our kid? Moments like that, we didn’t feel like he were our kid. To be honest with ya, I wouldn’t have minded a kid who liked playin video games, sat around with his mates, wanted to go paint-ballin or go-kartin, like a normal lad. Where did he get all this poncy stuff from? Weren’t from me, that’s for sure. It blew me mind.; Jules’ last question was this. ‘Would you say that religion plays a part in your drive to succeed?’; Sebastian leant forward to the microphone. ‘We do invoke Our Heavenly Father. We try to do Our Father’s bidding. He told us not to give up. So we are doing just that.’; ‘Ha!’ said Matt, with a self-satisfied air, eyes glued to the TV. ‘I told them that as well, right when they started out! Just goes to show, I know what I’m talking about. They don’t need bloody God to tell them.’ He muttered on for a bit about being the next Simon Cowell, like a massive talent-spotter. I snorted me little umbrella right out of me cocktail tryin not to laugh. He so wouldn’t believe it if I told him he litrally is this Heavenly Father what they’re on about. Oh, my god, it makes me die!; ‘And your name: The Lost Boys and the Heavenly Host. Are you still lost, do you think?’ asked Jules.; ‘We are all lost,’ said Sebastian. ‘And we are all seeking that which we have lost, we want to feel whole. Together we are one, and together we will find what we are looking for.’; I felt shivers go up me arms at this, and had to have another Tequila Slammer to calm me nerves. The camera panned out to show all the Heavenly Host, the twelve Lost Boys at the front holding hands, their furry hats framing their pixie faces. All except one little lad on the end of the row, looked a bit older than Nicholas. I looked closer, I were sure I’d seen him around somewhere, but then again all them kids look the same to me. This kid had his arms folded, never looked up, his hood down, and a bit of a scowl on him. They all smiled at the camera except him. He just stared down at the floor. Looked like trouble to me.; By now it were so normal to see Nicholas on the telly we hardly batted an eye. He spent weeks away from home with the choir. We would sometimes fly to Paris to have lunch with him, or fly to Venice for a couple of days to see him in concert. He were constantly in demand.; We got to a rehearsal room at Barbican one time, and crept in at the back. The choir were singin. Nick were at the front facin them with a white baton, conductin away. We’d never seen him do this before. He looked way too little to be doin it somehow. Sebastian were standin to his side, curvin his own arm around Nick’s, helpin to bring in them singers what sing lower, and them ones what sing really high, at the right times. All of em was singing, and then with one twitch of the baton they bought in that girl with the really high voice to soar above it all. I thought ‘Here we go, I’m gonna have to put me fingers in me ears if that Izzy’s gonna start howlin.’ But actually, it weren’t that bad. I could sort of see why people liked it. She were really getting famous, she were all over the papers. If she dared go on a beach in a bikini, oh yeah, you knew about it. You knew all what she had in her shoppin trolley, you knew where she’d been for a night out.; That one grumpy lad weren’t singin though. He were glarin at Nick and Sebastian. I thought to meself, oh my god, he’s probably jealous cos Nick gets on so well with Sebastian. Maybe he don’t get to have a go at conducting. Maybe that’s why he looks so pissed off.; Sebastian stopped the singers. He took the baton from Nick. ‘Look, Nicholas,’ he said. ‘Feel the strands, invisible strands connecting the end of this baton to everyone in the choir. Your every tiny movement is magnified along the strands and tweaks the sound, controls it, affects the blend of sound, do you see?’; The choir were completely silent, staring at him, transfixed by his lovely liquid voice. That Izzy, you could see she were all gooey over him. I think they was probably all in love with him. Not hard to see why. Couldn’t keep me eyes off of him, meself! Lush is the only word for him.; ‘If I weren’t here to help you,’ Sebastian continued, ‘you would have to have confidence. Learn to take up this baton and wield it…’ Nick, listening carefully, twitched the baton experimentally, ‘…with care, though, with authority, with power. It’s like you have to picture sizzling lightning coming out of the end. Lightning which can wake people up! Zap them out of their stupor.’ He smiled at Nicholas. Ah, that smile. You’d have to see it to believe it. ‘Feel the power, little lad! Wake up the people!’ He laughed a low laugh.; I clocked that little jealous chap turning his head angrily away with a grimace. I’d been right then! Good judge of what’s goin on, me!; Sebastian spotted the lad turn away. ‘Hey, Finn!’ he called out. The little guy turned towards us with a scowl. ‘Would you like to have a go now?’; There were a pause. Everyone in the choir turned to look at Finn. ‘Nah,’ said Finn. ‘Why would I? You’ve already found someone to do it.’ He closed down his face and turned away again.; It were a couple of weeks after that that the first like miracle happened. The Heavenly Host did a concert in Vienna and there were a whole bunch of kids from the local hospital at the front of the theatre. Sebastian and little Nicholas came to the front and held out their hands. Screaming fans reached out to them, grasping their fingers, desperately tryinga touch any part of them.; The next week it were all over the Vienna news that nine of the sick children was litrally miraculously better. Don’t know if it were just the press makin it up for the sake of a good story, it probably were, you know what they’re like, but all nine apparently claimed to have touched the boys.; By now, Matt were seriously hasslin me for more kids. Ha bloody ha, as if! No way were I going to go through another pregnancy. Did me head in the first time. I wanted to just point to them kids on the stage, and say to him: ‘Look, all them fuckin children is yours mate! Just gimme a break. You got enough!!’ But I din’t of course.; Everywhere Sebastian and Nicholas went they was followed by cameras, film-crews and screamin fans. Somebody brought up the rights to the film of their life. They started to write the script and score and everythin. As we spent more time visitin Nicholas so we got to know the other kids better every time. OMG there was so many of them by then. Two hundred in the Heavenly Host. Still twelve boys in the Lost Boys though, a core of em.; Watchin one of the concerts at the O2 on the telly, Jeez, it were massive, I noticed they had a new girl singin the really high bits. ‘That’s not right,’ said Matt, puzzled. ‘That new girl isn’t as good as Izzy. People won’t like it.’; ‘She’s probably buggered off, can’t be bothered with it no more,’ I said. We asked Nicholas. He were sad about it, I could tell. He just said she left out of the blue. ‘Unfortunately, Mother, drugs were becoming a problem for her,’ he said. I know! He always calls me ‘Mother,’ like he’s in a dusty old book or somethin. ‘The poor girl couldn’t cope with the fame. You can see what it’s like with the press stalking you all the time: horrendous! Some people just can’t take it.’; Finn, that little jealous one, bothered me. He just never looked happy. Nicholas told me his mother had died and his father had chucked him out when he were thirteen. He’d been the youngest of the Lost Boys till Nick turned up. Yeah, Nick joinin really put his nose outta joint. Finn’s dad had always been in a constant rage that his kid din’t look nothing like him. OMG, talking to Nicholas about him, I suddenly remembered that horrible scary man with the orange skip truck what came to me door like years before when that kid were only a tot. That were where I’d seen him before. I’d clocked he’d been litrally smacked about by his ‘dad’, yeah, you could tell, no wonder he looked so messed up.; Anyway, apart from that poor Finn lad, The Heavenly Host moved over the world like a great army, a pure human mass of cleansin power. Kinda like a massive Dettox wipe, if you think about it, cleanin up people’s shit. The songs made you feel clean, that’s what. You’d hear one on the radio and it’s like you got yerself brainwashed. You’d think, OK, let’s not worry about what I done yesterday, I’m gonna think about today! I’m gonna try hard today, I’m gonna do me best, I’m gonna help people. And I did go out and help Shelley choose some new shoes to go with her new clubbin outfit cos we was going to the ball at the Country Club in Epping.; I just let meself go along with the whole thing. It were fun, it were glam, people treated us like royalty. I were just lovin life. Thing is, I never knew what were going to happen, did I? There were no way I coulda known. My mum always says, ‘yeah, but you couldn’t of known, Shardie? How could you of known?’ And she’s right. There were like litrally no way I coulda known.",0,1,0.11728737895609388
783,33,66,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"It’s so like harder than you think bringin up a kid. I did get meself that nanny, and she were well good with Nicholas, so I still got to have good times out with Debs and Shelley, but as soon as the nanny went home it were like he were controllin me. If I did anythin he didn’t like, he would make a right fuss. In a nice way though, mostly. It weren’t like he screamed the place down nor nothin, he just somehow made it clear that he were not pleased.; He did have one well bad strop though once at Mums and Tots. We’d started taking him to Bunnies in Spellbrook only the week before. He kinda liked it for the first couple of times, cos they let you do paintin, which he loved. But then they said we was going to do music. Me heart sunk, cos I knew what Nicholas would be like. If the music weren’t the Lost Boys, he weren’t havin none of it.; So they gave all the kids a little drum or tambourine and started singin ‘the Wheels on the Bus.’ Nicholas listened for all of twenty seconds, his frown deepenin and deepenin. Then he got up, threw his tambourine at the ceiling and went round the circle kickin the drums and triangles out of the little kiddies’ hands, roaring in anger. ‘STUPID BUS!’ he yelled. ‘NO STUPID BUS! ONLY WANT MY OST BOYS.’ He rushed over to the craft table and tipped it over. Playdough and scissors went flyin. He grabbed the snack table and tipped it over, and kicked it. Crackers and marmite and Fruit Shortcake went all over the floor. Everyone were just lookin on in shock and horror. I mean, how were he even that strong? He were only like two and a half. It’s like he’d been taken over by something that were not even himself, like he were possessed or somethin.; Thinkin about it I realised that since the only music he had ever put up with were the Lost Boys, he sort of thought that were the only music what existed in the world. To see other people suddenly indulgin theirselves in other music seemed like All Wrong, if you get my drift. I sort of get it, why he thought it were So like Wrong.; So it were a shame but we couldn’t go to the Mums and Tots after that, which meant it were harder for him to make friends. So we sat at home a lot. He did his paintin at the table, you shoulda seen the amount of paper that lad got through, forests and forests of the stuff, and I would smoke and chat to Debs or Shelley on the phone. When he started school, we was nervous, because his teacher were this young lady what loved to sing. We had heard that she sang all day to the kids. Matt went and had a quiet word with her about Nicholas’ obsession. She were so nice and said that for the first couple of music lessons they would play and sing some Lost Boy songs, and introduce other songs little by little, which eased him in and made him slightly more acceptin of other things.; When he got to eight, Nicholas came to me, took me fag off of me and stubbed it out, I were like ‘Oy, give that back,’ but he said, all serious, ‘Mother, I’ve made up my mind. I want to join the choir at the church.’; I know! Makes me die! His way of speaking is like so…formal. I rolled me eyes. But whatcha gonna do? I don’t think I’m a bad person right? I don’t. I am just a person who did her best. And my mum always says, ‘You can’t do more than your best, Shardie.’ So I done the best I could for that kid, I give it 110 percent, but he’s just turned out the way he is. My mum says, she says, ‘Shardie, they are gonna do what they are gonna do. There ain’t no other way.’ She’s right, you know. There ain’t no other way.; So off he went. And you’ll never guess who the visiting choir-master was. Only flippin Sebastian. He were on a ‘boostin the community’ type mission back in his home town, he told us, to recruit and train talented youth for his choir. Me little boy’s eyes all lit up when he saw him. He broke away from me and ran. Ran into the guy’s arms. From that moment on we hardly saw Nicholas. They was constantly rehearsing, they was tourin with the choir. He were so good at singin, Sebastian promoted him into the Heavenly Host on his ninth birthday. I’m not gonna lie, we was thrilled, but we was also a bit sad, because our boy had to go off on world tours. It were generally expected that we would pull him out of school as it were an honour to be excepted into the Heavenly Choir. We had to arrange like home tutoring for him in Maths, English, French, Science and all that.; We went with him on trips of course. Stayed in hotels nearby. Had him back to our room for the night so he could sleep enough. He grew older and more confident. His voice improved but were still very high. He sang the highest of em all, apart from that girl, Izzy, who practically made your eardrums burst. He were given solo parts. His voice sang out over all the world. When the press interviewed The Heavenly Host as it were now called, they would get a few quotes from Nicholas. He would always say well cute things. Like, ‘I grew up with the sounds of the Heavenly Host in my ears. I wanted nothing else from my life except for that beauty. It made me feel peace within my soul.’; We just gave ourselves up to it really. Accompanied him on his travels. Accepted that he were an important and talented person. As my mum always says, ‘A person’s gotta do what a person’s gotta do, Shardie, it’s no good tryina stop em. It’s just not gonna work.’; Luckily the other members of the choir had given up pesterin Matt about him being their father, but I often noticed them stealin looks at him when he were turned away. They gazed at him with adoring eyes. It were clear to me that they was still convinced he were their father. I damn well knew he were, but no way were I going to admit it!; The choir got bigger and bigger. Every country we went to another five or ten kids seemed to be scooped up. Always with the same look. White hair, blazin eyes, long cool fingers, clear-cut cheekbones. They was becomin legendary in the world. I began to wonder to meself, how on earth was all these kids really Matt’s kids? Were that really possible?; I phoned Pat one day from a hotel in Rome up near the Spanish steps. I were havin a sudden fit of curiosity. ‘Pat,’ I says, ‘did you ever send any of Matt’s sperm abroad?’; ‘Erm, well, now you mention it,’ she says, ‘I suppose I did really, yes. I used to send it by special van to Amsterdam and Milan. Why? Is there a problem?’; ‘No, not a problem….er, Pat? How often did you send it?’; ‘A couple of times a week. Over like, what was it? Fourteen, fifteen years? There’s like fifty two weeks in a year…. Oh, bugger, I don’t know, you do the maths! I’m no good at all that, Shardie, you know me!’; I put the phone down tryin a do the maths! I got as far as fifty two times two that’s a hundred and four and then would it be times fifteen? Can’t be! That would be a massive number. I couldn’t do it, so I gave up. All I knew was, it were well possible that Matt had one hell of a lot of kiddies that he didn’t know about, I didn’t dare think how many, like could it be hundreds? Like even a thousand kiddies out there? Thinkin about it made me feel like I wanted to throw up, so I booked meself a nice haircut and highlights at a posh Italian hairdressers rather than go worryin me head about it.",0,1,0.11205884995507634
784,33,67,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"So me mum and me and Matt we never missed a single X-Factor after that. The Heavenly Host were never in the bottom two. They was like more addictive than fags. You just wanted to see more of em. Even as soon as they finished singin, you was gaggin for their next song. I know Matt and all me mates was voting for them endlessly. It’s like they had some special power over people. I would always vote for somebody else but I knew I were losin the battle. Them kids was gonna be famous and there were nothin I could do about it.; It were around then that I got pregnant. I know, right? I don’t know how that happened! I so had not wanted it. I’d managed to reach the ripe old age of thirty three free of screamin brats and were planning a couple more decades of fun. I’d been so careful too, darn it. I only remember the zillions of blow-jobs, I don’t remember never agreeing to any of the other. Oh well, them pregnancy kit things don’t lie. I had to get on with it.; I couldn’t bear the idea of nappies and bottles and becoming fat and tired. But me mate Shelley, she said, ‘Don’t worry, Shardie, you got yourself enough money you’ll be able to afford a nanny!’ So from that moment I cheered up, and booked meself a shoppin bonanza in Dubai for just after the baby were due to be born. ‘Gotta keep your spirits up, Shardonnay, bit of retail therapy required,’ I said to meself with one of me bigger cackles.; When I tell you what happened with the birth and that, you will laugh! Honest, every time I tell it to someone I end up almost wettin meself laughin. So, here we go: I always fill up Matt’s car and take it for a little valet, keep it nice and tidy for him, see, but you won’t believe this, I only went and put diesel in it by mistake din’t I? I think bein pregnant had messed with me brain. So we’d realised I were in labour cos me waters had broke all over the kitchen floor, we rushed into the car, and we was five minutes up the road on our way into Harlow and blow me if the car din’t start doing these hiccups. Like big jerks, jumpin all over the place. It jolted the baby somewhat rotten. Matt swore and pulled over at a bus stop.; We was stuck there in the lashin rain with the windscreen wipers going squeakety squeak, squeakety squeak, wonderin what the hell we was goin to do. Matt started messin around with the engine and trying to phone the garage to ask them what to do, and then, out of the blue it were, I started to feel the baby coming out! Oh, my God, this story makes me die! I were like, ‘Matt, it’s coming out! It’s coming out!’ and he were like ‘It’s never!’ I put me hand down and actually felt the baby’s head tryina get out me knickers! Not being funny or anything but if that ain’t gonna make you panic, what is?; He phoned the hospital with one hand and helped me to the bus shelter with the other as it were pissin down and sittin in the car were well painful. Din’t have time to take me heels off, (nor me vajazzle, lol!) I just yanked down me knickers, knelt down on Matt’s coat and clung onto the bench in the bus shelter. I remember thinking, ‘Lucky I ain’t one of them women what makes a fuss! I’m glad I’m a girl what just gets on with it!’ and our baby just slipped out easy as! Matt caught him and wrapped him in the coat. I just couldn’t stop laughin. Honestly, what am I like! We sat on the bench, giving him a cuddle.; A nice girl with a fancy briefcase gave me some of her chewin gum. An air-hostess waiting for the bus to Stansted in her lovely electric blue uniform (ooh, I wouldn’t mind having a go in that I’m a sucker for uniform!) had a ‘blanket in a bag’ what they give you on planes in her suitcase. She gave it to us to wrap round me bits, cos, as you can imagine, I felt a bit exposed. An old lady passin with her little dog gave us a plastic poo bag to put the plassenta thing in. Ugh, that bit were disgustin, yeah, you don’t wanna know! By the time the ambulance arrived to take us to the hospital there were quite a queue of people waitin for the bus, all of em quite surprised to see a baby what had got hisself born right there in their bus shelter! And I were on the phone to me mum, telling her about the baby and his blue eyes and how we was thrilled to bits.; OMG though, I were not prepared for how lush our little baby were. I had to admit, he were gorjuss! Nicholas, we called him. He had the most flawless skin and chubby little fingers. Hair as blond as blond can be, but the darkest, longest eye-lashes you ever saw. I’m not really into babies, no, let’s be honest, but seriously, he were lovely. His biggest fan of course were his dad. Matt were workin from home still, solvin some science problems for his lectures, so he spent hours walkin round the house with Nicholas. They was like that, you know, bonded, father and son. I were so glad for em, really.; I never were that good with the baby. Did me best though. And me mum she always says, ‘You can only do your best, Shardonnay, no one can do more’n their best.’ One thing I did like doin for him were shoppin. I bought him tractors and lovely booties and car transporters and baby computers and that. But the only thing he seemed to like were paintin, like with his fingers at first, then with brushes in his high-chair. We had to let him do it, otherwise he would grizzle and frown. And that bloody music had to be on the whole ruddy time, didn’t it?; Matt always used to put on the ‘Lost Boys with the Heavenly Host’ CD and rock Nicholas to sleep. It were odd but that were the only music what worked and stopped him cryin. By the time he were one, he were pointin at the telly and saying ‘Ost boys! Ost boys!’ When the Lost Boys did come on, which were often because they was so damn famous by now and had the Christmas number one for the second year runnin, Nicholas would wiggle his little body in delight, and try to sing along! So funny, it did make me laugh.; The Lost Boys that year had released a single called ‘From Little Acorns’ and even I liked it. You couldn’t help but like it really. It just got to you, made you cry with the harmonies and that. The chorus went ‘We’re rocked in our cradle, we’re rocked in our tree, we’re rocked in our Father’s arms, and he’s close to me.’ See, I can sing, when I want to! You shoulda heard little Nicholas when he were only just one singin ‘Fwom wittle aaacooooorns, come lovely leeeeeeves, from wittle aaaacoooorns, come ancient tweeeees.’ Bleeeeeess. Made us die! I got a video somewhere.; The Lost Boys was gettin bigger and bigger. After that Christmas they started a world tour, and new members kept joinin their bigger group, the Heavenly Host. There was like a hundred of em! Female fans around the world was having theirselves screaming fits, like with the Beatles. They knew every name of every boy, their birthdays, their favourite meals, colours. They could distinguish between em, for starters. I couldn’t. For the life of me, they all looked the same. Just like their dad, in other words! Ha ha. He still didn’t have a clue. Maybe had inklins of a suspicion but could not put his finger on it at all.; Then I had a bit of an awkward thing happen. Matt came into the bathroom unexpectedly after sex one day, lookin for his phone. I were only in the middle of spittin his sperm into me jar. Oops. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked.; ‘Cleanin me teeth,’ I said briskly, seizin a brush and rinsin the jar quickly. Oh, bloody hell, I thought, that’s two hundred blinking quid and one or more poor unborn Lost Boy litrally down the drain!; Me man looked a bit flummoxed, but said no more.; One day around a year later, we was in London doing some Christmas shoppin. Nicholas were nearly two years old by then. Matt were pushin the buggy. Nicholas were clutchin the Eskimo doll he’d screamed for in Harrods. Me mum always says, ‘If they want something real bad, Shardie, what you gonna do? You just gotta get it for em.’ So I did. I got it for him. It had a white fur collar and cuffs. I knew why he were obsessed with that. It’s because them bleedin Lost Boys on the telly always wear fake white furry collars and sing in the snow and that.; We was walkin through Trafalgar Square when a couple of violins started up near that north plinth thing and we noticed a crowd gatherin. I went to get some candy floss from a stall but Matt pushed the buggy to the front of the crowd.; By the time I got there and realised it were only the Heavenly Bloody Host, it were too bloody late. Matt and Nicholas was litrally transfixed. BBC cameras was everywhere and big fuzzy mics pickin up their latest carol. I must admit, it were lovely. A huge audience gathered, all of em weepin real tears. Me attention must of wandered, because I looked down, and Nicholas weren’t in his buggy! ‘Matt!’ I said. ‘Where the fuck is the baby?’; Matt pointed a shaky finger. I saw Nicholas toddlin over to Sebastian. He reached him and held out his arms. Sebastian, mid-verse, crouched down and opened up his arms. My baby walked into them and were lifted up. Sebastian and Nicholas’ faces were centimetres apart, grinnin at each other. OMG the likeness were just undeniable. The crowd gasped. The cameras whirred. Nicholas beamed.; That clip got millions of views on Youtube. It had Nicholas in Sebastian’s arms singin at the top of his voice ‘Fwom wittle Aaacoooooorns, come ancient Tweeeees,’ with the violins in the background and the snow falling on his dark lashes. OMG, people just cried their eyes out.; From then on, as a family, we had to go to every flippin Heavenly Host concert there were. O2, Wembley Arena, Milton Keynes Bowl, we was there. If I tried to book somethin else, or God forbid actually take Nicholas to something else, he would just point blank stick his heels in and refuse to go. The only thing he would watch on the telly was the Heavenly Bloody Host. Oh God, I just so hoped he would go off them soon. I prayed it were a phase.; But it weren’t a phase. He just went on and on lovin em. Obsessed he were.; From around the time he got to two and a half, he never stopped singin. You could hear him in his room, bless im, hollerin ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful,’ and ‘Jerusalem’ at the top of his voice, lovely little man. Course, I tried to get him into football, rugby and that, buying him all the latest goals, balls, kits, but he weren’t havin none of it.; One time at the O2, Nicholas were five, and he went missin. Yeah, we went to lost kids and everythin, we had them calling for him on the tannoy, we was runnin round like headless chickens. Turned out he was in their dressin room, chattin away to the Heavenly Host. Askin for their autographs. Askin em questions. Serious head-case that boy.; Me and Matt just stood at the door, bent over double with runnin, pantin, shouldn’t smoke so many fags, the panic wearin off. But I’ll never forget how much fear I felt in me gut and how much relief I felt at findin him. I kind of realised then I think, that though maybe I hadn’t been that good at showing it, and I weren’t the best mum in the world….no, let’s be honest, I’m the first to admit it….I kinda did love that little boy.",0,1,0.11566843096139967
785,33,68,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Ok, so a few weeks after that boy Sebastian came round for a chat with Matt, a whole load of em came round. Again, I were out. Couldn’t stay in on guard all the time, could I? I’d been shoppin in Harlow, getting some lovely designer stuff in Matalan and got me nails done. I got back, all ready to try on this lacy blouse and tartan mini-skirt, but OMG my heart sank, din’t it, as I walked in and clocked em. They was all standing there, in a row, all ten or eleven of them. All starin at Matt.; Matt were sittin in his director’s chair, head in hands. He really had the hump this time. He were swaying back n forth. Looked just a bit like a mental case. He looked up as I banged the door. He looked right through me, it were well odd.; He stood up. ‘Shardonnay. I’m struggling to understand something. How come all these children seem to think I am their father?’; ‘I dunno,’ I shrugged. I got out me packet of fags. ‘Maybe they’ve all gone mental.’ I laughed but I couldn’t help but be a bit scared at the look in his eye. He really were vergin on lookin a tad demented.; ‘Sebastian here says that it’s possible that …’ he choked slightly, ‘my….sperm…’ he looked desperately at the children, ‘….could have made its way to a…fertility clinic.’; I snorted. Couldn’t help it. The description of Pat’s motley old house as a ‘fertility clinic’ were just too funny.; There were a bit of a horrible pause. I would say ‘pregnant’ pause but that would be for lols only. All the children was lookin well embarrassed, stealin glances at each other. It were frankly a bit of an interestin moment.; ‘Oh, don’t be daft!’ I scoffed. ‘How on earth could your….sperm, go of its own accord, like, to a fertility clinic, like what you say?’ I spat out these words and made them drip with ridicule as much as I could. I lit me fag from the cooker.; The kids all looked suitably shame-faced. But then, that girl with the strawberry blond hair with them eyes what don’t never seem to blink, chipped in with a bit of a bombshell. ‘The sperm could have been…let’s say….’extracted’ from Matt here, and sold, possibly?’; Them fuckin eyes was starin straight at me as she said this! She ain’t got no eyelashes nor eyebrows. Weird. Them eyes give me the shivers. But, give her her due, she’s one smart bitch. Takes one to know one, eh? Sebastian shook his head at her and said, ‘Izzy, just let it go.’; ‘Yeah….Izzy!’ I breathed smoke at her, lookin straight back at her. She got another blinkin (or unblinkin more like!) think comin if she thinks she can stare me out, little cow! ‘I like litrally can’t believe you just said that!’ I said. ‘That is just so ridiculous. No one would be mad enough to do that!’ I were thinking ‘Ha ha but I am! and I were! Looool.’; ‘Besides which,’ I went on, frownin, like lookin confused and innocent and affronted at the same time, as I am a good actor, ‘sperms don’t last long. You’d litrally have to be shootin them up people straight away for them to have any hope of getting anyone up the duff. So how would that work then, eh? You thinkin I had long lines of ladies waiting with their legs open up the street somewhere? Hunh? You been watchin too much sci-fi?’; OMG I sooo should of been in movies. Wanted to be Eliza in My Fair Lady I did, I woulda been brilliant, ‘All I want is a room somewhere….far away from the cold night air…..’; Anyway, ‘Come on, darlins,’ I went on. ‘Give it a rest! Leave the poor man in peace. He’s a good looker, and you know, you’re not bad lookers yourselves, but everyone wants a piece of the poor guy! Enough’s enough, now, toodle-oo.’; They filed out, hair gleamin in the late afternoon sun. They stole backward glances at me man but for quite a few months after that, we didn’t hear a peep.; I were sittin on the settee watchin the X-factor. I weren’t paying much attention really as I were textin Debs at the same time, but a sudden gasp from Matt made me look up.; ‘Look!’ he exclaimed. ‘It’s those children!’; ‘What children?’ I asked.; He were leanin forward in his chair, mouth open. ‘You know, those carol singers that came round about six months ago. They’re on the telly.’; I had a good look. Oh my Lord, it were them an all. A dozen gorjuss boys all in a line. A proper choir, all dressed in blue, with furry white collars and cuffs. That tall lad what came round ours were in the middle of em, tall and still. Stunnin cheekbones as ever, and them unforgettable flashin blue eyes.; Matt had gone right up close to the telly. ‘It’s that Sebastian, Shardie, look!’ he said.; They was singin all together you know, when they all sing different notes what go together, what’s that called? Harmony. That’s it. Their song actually, don’t know why, it gave me the goosebumps it were that spooky. Kind of slow and hauntin, a song of loss and despair.; Halfway through the song the music suddenly swelled, and a whole load more boys and girls filed in behind the first lot, loads of em, like loads and loads, all of em joinin in with the low notes, the high notes, til the stage was like completely packed out with em and it’s like every note that you can think of were bein sung at once, seemed like to me. OMG the audience was goin wild for it, they was all standin up. The atmosphere were electric.; The song got more and more powerful, sort of like the sea when there’s really big massive crashin breakers, they was all well into it. Must admit, even though it weren’t my type of thing, I did go a bit teary.; Occasionally one of them or two would get a little solo. The camera stopped on two little boys what looked like twins and they sang a solo together, then it stopped on a girl. Oh, jeez, I recognised her, that pushy one with no eyelashes, what were her name, she had come round with Sebastian. OMG though, got a bit of a voice on her! High, very high. Her voice soared over the top of all of it. I had to put me fingers in me ears.; ‘Shardie! It’s Izzy, remember?’ said Matt. Oh, yeah, I din’t really want to remember, little cow.; I were thinking it were such a sad song they’d probably get buzzed off, but no, the judges went all teary too didn’t they? Typical.; I tutted and said ‘Pathetic!’ I always like to do me own commentary on all the acts. I could be an X- factor presenter. Easy as. They earn a packet too.; A sudden snorty noise from Matt made me look at him. I thought he were laughin, but no – tears was only streamin down his face! I know, what a wuss! The daft bugger, bless him, he’s got a heart like so big, it’ll be the death of im.; Simon (ooh, love him! Gorjuss!) were askin that Sebastian, who seemed to be the leader of the choir, what the group’s name were. Sebastian blinked. The blue of his eyes looked like it were gonna come right out of the telly. He were even more dazzlin on telly than in real life. ‘We twelve,’ he looked along his row of boys, ‘are called ‘The Lost Boys.’ We feel like we don’t know where we’re going…nor where we come from….but together we feel whole. That’s why we hold hands all the time, and stick together.’; The judges was speechless. Honest to God, they just sat there, open-mouthed. I could see the dollar signs in Simon’s eyes, oh yeah, you couldn’t miss em!; ‘The children in the rows behind are called The Heavenly Host,’ he said. ‘We couldn’t produce the richness of our sound without them. They are our very valued backing singers and their ranks are swelling every day.’; Then Simon went on for a bit about how the Lost Boys would be bigger than the Military Wives, and how the whole world were going to warm to em. I were rolling my eyes. I wouldn’t buy that song in a million years! Too bloody moany and borin if you ask me. Simon asked the leader what his name was.; ‘I’m Sebastian,’ he said.; ‘Are you related to one another?’ asked Simon. ‘It’s just…’ he looked genuinely curious…’you seem so alike…you’re like little clones of each other.’; The audience laughed, but you could see on their faces, they was all wantin to know.; ‘Well… Our Father… ‘ Sebastian blinked again like a camera taking a picture, dark lashes sweeping his cheeks, ‘.. told us to sing,’ the other kids was all nodding their little heads in agreement, ‘so… we sing.’; A little boy of about five next to him stood on tiptoes to reach the mic. ‘Our Father told us never to give up, so we won’t never give up.’ Aah, his voice were really cute actually must be said.; ‘Next week,’ continued Sebastian, ‘we want to do ‘We Are Family,’ if you guys out there vote to keep us in the competition, that is! We do feel like Family, so yeah, maybe…maybe we are related.’; ‘Ooh, cryptic words there,’ cooed the presenter, ‘from the leaders of the Heavenly Host, The Lost Boys, who are now the favourites to win this competition.’; The next day, I walked into my kitchen and found the CD of ‘The Lost Boys with the Heavenly Host’ on the table! Bloody Norah, that were quick. My husband were like an instant and complete 110 percent fan of them kids, unbelievable! What a sucker.",0,1,0.07004111623143879
786,33,69,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"We’ll cut straight to the chase today. Don’t want to delay as Shardonnay has her loyal fans and addicts what are waiting for her. The only news is: do you think there is a slight hint of Spring in the air? And have you noticed it’s still not dark at five o’clock? Maybe (sing it!) the dark days are over? Fuckin hope so. Winter is a killer.; The reason I got so pissed off with Matt in the first place were he lied to me. Those first few months we was together he told me many times that he’d deleted ol Clarissa, his ex, from his phone. Yeah, you wouldn’t like her, she’s a real toff, teaches at the university, if you please. Now don’t get me wrong, I ain’t got nothin against her type, but lord they just don’t seem to get it, do they? It’s as if they is litrally livin on a whole different planet from us mortals. All la-di-da and hoity-toity she were ol Clarissa. I had a quick look though his phone when he were out mowing the lawn, and there were her name, Clarissa, plain as day. I looked at his conversation with her and it were, shall we say, ongoin. With texts like, ‘Alright, have a great day,’ and ‘Life’s just not the same without you.’ I mean, cheeky bloody bastard. There were even a bitchy comment about me! ‘Gotta go otherwise I’ll get grief!’ Ha, makes me mad! He thinks he can do that to me, he’s litrally got another think coming.; That were roundabout the time that my neighbour Pat, the only one what had been at all friendly really since we moved to Church Langley, bumped into me in Tescos. ‘Hey, Shardonnay,’ she had whispered shiftily. ‘Do you fancy earnin a bit on the side?’; When she told me what it was I’d been expecting worse! I thought she meant like high class escort service type stuff. Now that woulda been hard work. This in comparison seemed a bit of a doddle.; And it were so well paid. I mean, for litrally three minutes (sometimes two! Ha! Honestly I got it down to a fine art!) of mouth work, you’re getting a hundred and fifty quid. Well, hello! What’s not to like?; Debs though, me mate, one day come out with this: ‘Shardonnay, do you realise how many sperms is in just one mouthful?’; I shook me head. ‘Not a bleedin clue, Debs,’ I admitted with one of me bigger cackles. ‘How many?’; ‘Millions,’ she said solemnly. ‘Millions and millions.’ She sucked on her fag.; I were a bit shocked. ‘Really, Debs? What? Millions? Can that be right?’; ‘Yeah, Shardie. I think you is being diddled. For them millions you should even be paid even more ‘n what you is gettin.’; I were still sayin ‘Millions? In every little gob-load? That can’t be right.’ I mean, I knew they was fizzy, the little buggers, but not that fizzy! I lit a fag meself, to calm me down.; ‘You don’t want to undervaluate the work what you is doin, Shardie,’ she went on. ‘You is doin a good job. You is providin a service for poor ladies what find it hard to get a man.’; ‘Yeah. I am that.’ I got all teary after she said that. I felt proud, and like a really good person, like I were helping all them ladies get their dream baby. And whenever I did worry about it, like about Matt not knowing, I would say to meself, ‘yeah, Shardie, but he should never of done that, should he now?’ And then I would answer meself too, and I would answer, ‘No, he effin well should not of done that. End of. Ta very much. Bob’s yer uncle. Whatever.’; One day, it were sunny, I remember, so it must of been summertime, I saw a massive orange truck draw up on the road outside me house. It had a skip on the back. I hadn’t ordered no skip, so I wondered what were goin on and opened the door. There were an enormous ugly chap, probably in his mid-thirties, who came round the cab, opened the passenger door and like yanked out this poor skinny kid what were only about three or four. He kept him grabbed by the shoulder in a strong, painful grip. The man had thick coarse curly black hair and massive stained teeth. His nose were bulgy and misshapen. His skin were red and unhealthy-lookin. He spoke in a kind of raspy whisper. ‘I come for a bloke named Matthew. Is ‘e ‘ere?’; ‘Erm, no,’ I said with a swift look over me shoulder to check Matt were not around. ‘He’s not often here….working abroad, I’m afraid.’; The man stared me out with his own dark brown eyes.. ‘People….’ he rasped, with some difficulty, ‘people….keep saying that my ‘son’ here looks very very like this Matthew chap, resembles him more than he does me. I just wanted to see it for meself.’ He craned his neck to look over me shoulder into the house.; I looked at the tot. He seemed to have difficulty raising his head. He were silent, just staring at the ground. His dad grabbed him by the chin and held his face up to the sun.; ‘Hmm,’ I said, looking past the dirty smears at the boy’s cheekbones, the deep blue of his eyes, that top lip, that sharp chin. The absolute spittin image of me husband TBH. ‘Nah, you got nothing to worry about, mate. This lad ain’t nothing like our Matt. This lad’s gorgeous, aincha mate? Our Matt though, bless im, ooh no, he is so not a looker! Poor man, not a looker at all!’; I coulda gone on and tried to convince the chap that the boy looked like himself, but that woulda been a lie.; The man let go of the boy’s chin. The kid immediately hunched right back over, and stuck his dirty thumb in his mouth. He looked right royally pissed off actually, well, would you blame him? The man reluctantly shoved the boy back in the truck, turning his head to look at me balefully. Ooh, it give me the shivers all over, that look did. I did wonder just for a minute if the sadness in that lad’s eyes could maybe be one of them consequence thingies of what I done. I hoped not. I banished his eyes from me mind and went down town to get me acrylics done, cheer me up.",0,1,0.013804758560727654
788,33,70,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Am a bit busy today. Took Fred off to the station. He’s going to Paris again tonight lucky thing gets to stay in a posh hotel. Then I’ll do the ponies, then zoom to Cambridge for the wondrous Herceptin, then if I get back in time, RDA in the afternoon, come back via the farm shop, then flute lessons. So I will just give you a picture of Tabby being a frog in Animal Studies. It makes me happy because I realise that Tabby has been doing science all along, I just never realised it. It’s obvious from the picture that she has really understood ‘frogness’.; Yeah, so the ‘just not thinking about it’ weren’t working that well. I started to wake up in the middle of the night worryin about the horde coming round and gettin me husband off of me. Or asking for loads of money, or like fighting over the house, like it were theirs or something.; I went round Pat’s with a fresh loada man-milk and asked if I could go in for coffee. ‘Course, love,’ she said.; ‘Pat?’ I said. ‘How many babies do you think have been made out of Matt’s sperm?’; She looked at me and dragged a hand through her grey frizz. ‘Oh, not that many,’ she said.; ‘I think …they’re like…. comin to get me?’ I said. ‘If that makes sense?’; ‘No, no, that can’t be true,’ she reassured me. ‘They wouldn’t know where you live.’; But later, when she’d gone into the other room to check on a lady, Tass whispered, ‘Hey, Shardie.’; ‘Yeah?’; ‘Pat told me the other day she reckons your Matt’s got like three hundred and fifty kids.’; ‘What?’; ‘Three hundred and fifty, she said. She’s been keeping a tally.’; ‘Bloody Hell!’ I shrieked.; ‘Sshh,’ Tass whispered, ‘She’ll not be wanting you to know that! Shush!’; ‘But what am I going to do? Three hundred and fifty of the little bastards? And all wantin a bleedin Father no doubt.‘; ‘Well, did you never think of that before? Did you not think of the consequences of all this sperm donation?’; I stared at her with my jaw like litrally hitting the floor. OMG, so that’s what consequences meant! Truth of it were, whenever anyone asked me about them ‘consequence’ thingies, I’d never liked to say I didn’t really get what the word meant. I shoulda taken the time to look it up in the directory shouldn’t I?; ‘I….I just decided not to think about it really. I kinda thought they wouldn’t know. How did them little buggers find out who their father were? Who told em? That were never part of the deal?’; ‘It’s not that. No one breathed a word. But unfortunately in your case, it’s the visuals, innit? Those kiddies are just the spittin image of him aren’t they? Something about the lip….the eyes, the hair….’; ‘Yeah,’ I sighed. ‘Don’t I know it.’; ‘And truth of it is,’ she whispered, ‘Pat’s ‘clinic’ here does mainly serve quite a local population. We’ve never had to go far to find clients. The demand is just….phenomenal, really.’; ‘Oh, well, damage is done now, I spose,’ I sighed. I’ll just have to learn to live with the…you know…..bloody consequence thingies.’; I went and booked meself a spray tan so’s I wouldn’t think about it no more. Cos at the end of the day, I personally think that if it’s doin yer head in, that’s not helpin anyone is it? No one is bein helped by me havin me head done in, is what I’m saying. So might as well get on and get out, meet Shelley in Nando’s, see what bargains is to be had in Asda, have meself a posh sandwich in Subway, maybe even see what’s on at the Square in Harlow. Me and Debs coupla times even went to a silent disco! You wear headphones and dance to whatever you like. I’m tellin ya, it’s a scream! It’s like LMFAO, that means laugh your fuckin arse off, you should give it a go.; So I went out for cocktails at Baroosh Friday around five thirty. Met up with Debs and Shelley. We did have a larf. The lads behind the bar was giving us extra big measures. I drank three Mojitos and two Screwdrivers and one Pleasant Fucker. Came over all wobbly on the way out. Fell over on the pavement! What am I like?! Had a right giggle with a chap who helped me up. Debs drove me home.; I could hardly get the key in the lock I were that pissed. Seeing double and that. I threw me bag on the chair and staggered into the lounge. Oh, God. That hunky lad were back, with just one girl this time, and they was only sitting on the settee talkin to me husband.; Matt stared at me. His eyes looked afraid. Something had changed in him.; ‘Shardie,’ he started. ‘I have to be brave and come out with it, darling. This…young man…..Sebastian….is claiming somehow that….’ he hesitated, ‘I am his father.’; The girl looked embarrassed. She looked down. Sebastian took her hand.; I rolled my eyes. ‘Well, yeah, he would do!’ I said. ‘Everyone wants a bit of all this. Shnormal.’ I gestured around the lounge at the shag pile and our enormous wide-screen TV what is as big as the whole wall. (I know! Half price, since you’re askin, from The Range in Harlow.); ‘Shardie?’ questioned Matt, narrowing his eyes. ‘Did you know about this?’; ‘What? Shuddup!’ I said. ‘You shouldn’t of kept on texting Miss Prissy Pants now should ya?’; He came right up to me and whispered fiercely: ‘Shardie, are you really saying that you knew anything about all this? You knew that it was possible I had a child?’; Oops, Loooool, A child! Ha, bloody Ha! He din’t know the half of it!; He turned to the boy. ‘Listen, Sebastian. I don’t quite get this. Who is your mother? Is she claiming that I somehow had….relations with her? How old are you? I have been solely with Shardonnay here for the last sixteen years.’; ‘I am fifteen,’ said Sebastian. ‘I don’t know how I know it, I just feel it in my bones. I saw you in the street, I had to follow you home. I’m sorry but…I feel that you must be my father. And…oh God…’ He clutched the hand of the girl so tight he were twistin her skin.; ‘What, dear child?’ asked Matt.; He whispered it. ‘I know around ten other kids who believe you’re their dad as well….’; The girl stared at Matt out of unblinkin eyes, noddin, noddin away, her hair shining reddish, like strawberry blond she were, under me spotlights.; Luckily this were all too much for Matt. He just couldn’t take it in. ‘Sorry? What did you say? Oh, no, now you’re being ridiculous. Go on, get out. Had enough! Bugger off.’ He hustled them to the door and shoved them out. ‘Go on, get away with you, you scheming creatures.’; ‘Honestly!’ I exclaimed, as we listened to their feet scrunching away across the gravel. ‘Some people stop at nothin, eh? Thing is, love,’ I said, stroking my husband’s face, ‘you’re so gorgeous, there’s a whole load of poor deluded people going to wish with all their hearts that you was their father, course they are.’; Flattered, he let himself be guided to bed, where I extracted the evening dose, spat into the jar and ran it across the road. I then took him some hot chocolate to soothe his nerves, aah bleeess the poor man.",0,1,0.02905040561290562
789,33,71,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"I had a bit of a low a couple of weeks back. Fred had not got his job yet, the bills were piling up, the money was running out. A friend from uni had been round with her daughter who is doing a diploma in Engineering. I saw that she will spend her life being highly sought after to design bridges or something equally wonderful. My confidence in all my artsy-fartsy decisions suddenly imploded and I saw things afresh.; I thought: WTF have I been doing encouraging my kids into the arts? Why would you do that? Fred and I will die and they will be left on this Earth with no money. Oh, bollocks, I thought, why did we not do Kumon Maths instead of rehearsals for the Sound of Music? Trips to the theatre could have been trips to the Science Museum. My choice! How did I manage to be so misguided for litrally twenty years? I have not been living in the real world! People did try to tell me this, but I didn’t listen.; Look at all those years spent in darkened theatres, rehearsing, performing, gigging, dragging your double bass through the mud or heaving it onto trains. I thought Tabby would sail into drama school due to those years. Ha! Shows how little I knew and how much I was bolstered by self-delusion.; I am not a practical person. Odd, because I do love stirrup leathers and nosebands, throat lashes, saddle soap and hoof picks, but I suspect this is due to one of my past lives. But I wondered then, during this crisis, if I should have been MUCH more balanced in valuing all branches of knowledge, rather than allowing my default setting to surface. (Maths? Ugh!); A couple of weeks later I have recovered. I’m still a bit shaken but I still believe deep down that the Arts fill in the gaps, support our souls, allow us to access lost parts of ourselves and nourish our connectedness one to the other.; Anyway, on to the business of the moment: Shardonnay, Part 4.; One day Shelley an me we was in Baroosh and she comes out with, ‘You is getting a fair amount of money, Shardie, for not very much work.’; ‘Oh, like, SOO not true!’ I shot straight back. ‘Oh, my god, I can’t believe you just said that!’ Ooh, me indignation got me chokin on me pain au chocolate. Course what you gotta remember is, Shelley’s bloke can only get it up once a day, so maybe she were a touch jealous of all the cash what I were getting. ‘It’s a lot of work, Shelley! And it’s awkward, as you well know. Nicking sperm day in day out, without the person finding out? Skill required! People say blokes never want to indulge in conversation after having an orgasm? That’s like sooo not true! Matt’s always trying to get me to talk or lie there and cuddle. How long can you cuddle with a gob-load of spunk? You try it, it ain’t easy.’; I stopped talking for a long slurp on me latte. But I got more to say, this here is me pet subject! ‘And then I keep worrying like the little darlins are gonna die if they don’t get their chance to be shot up someone quick!’ I can’t help it, I let loose a big cackle at this. I am just so funny, I can’t stop laughin at me own jokes. And honest, I ain’t being funny or nothin, but that sperm is well fizzy in yer gob. You can like feel it being alive, and eager to get crackin in its little race!; But it weren’t easy. Often Matt would grab me as I were headin off. ‘Oy, come back here,’ he said, his voice husky and warm. ‘Don’t go rushing off.’; With a big valuable mouthful of sperm whatcha gonna say? Whatcha gonna do? I would make a cooing little moany sound and nuzzle his neck. Then, very carefully, I went off and flushed the loo so he would think I had had to go. Then I rushed downstairs to spit into me jam-jar.; Another time he sighed, out of the blue, as he’d just shot his load: ‘You know, Shardie my darling? I know you’re quite a lot younger than me but….do you think we might be ready to start having children?’; ‘Mmm, mmm?’ I said, wiggling my eyebrows. I rushed off to spit, charged over the road and came back to nip that little idea in the bud! Thing is, no way were I going to get into that trap. Long boozy lunches’d be out of the question with kids. I’ve seen em the mums with babies and toddlers. They can’t have a proper chat with their mates. They’re always hunched over in the caff, feeding em, fussing over em. Them babies always start to cry. And OMG all mums with kids, don’t they just let themselves go? They forget to make up, they forget to dress! It’s like the kid sucks all of the life out of em! No way, Jose, that’s what I say.; For sure though, I were too bloody smart to tell him that. ‘Sure, my love, let’s think about it,’ I soothed. ‘I’ll come off the pill in a few months, eh?’; He went all soppy at the thought. Ugh, doncha just hate it when a man gets soppy. ‘What will we call our little baby?’ he simpered.; I rolled my eyes (to myself of course.) ‘Oi, give us a bloody chance, mate! Don’t go puttin the cart before the orse!’; So one day, just before Christmas, I were halfway through painting a ‘statement wall’ in my bedroom a pale mauvey violet, when the doorbell went. Cursin and swearin, I got down off of me ladder, went downstairs and opened the door. OMG if it weren’t a whole horde of the little buggers, a dozen or so of em, all ages like from about six to fifteen. The lip, the purple flash, the white hair, I’m tellin ya, this lot had it all. I stared at them like I’d seen a ghost. So odd to see, like all developed in the flesh, that tiny thing what you just held in your mouth for one brief minute.; ‘Jesus Christ! Where did you come from?’ I muttered.; The tallest boy, the one I knew already, with creamy skin and the bluest most startlin eyes you ever saw in yer life, holding the hand of a little girl in a furry hood, stumbled over his words: ‘Um, please, could you tell us…maybe…does our father live here?’; ‘No,’ I hissed. ‘I told you before. You probably ain’t got no father.’ (‘Little bastards,’ I thought to meself.) ‘And me husband ain’t got no kids! Can’t you just get that in yer thick head?’; I felt a hand round my waist. ‘Darling?’ said Matt. ‘Who are all these people?’ He surveyed the throng and turned back to me. ‘Are they carol singers?’; OMG I nearly wet myself trying not to laugh. ‘Yeah, yeah, they are,’ I said firmly. I turned to the kids. ‘Go on then, sing!’; The horde’s mouths dropped open as they feasted their eyes upon me husband.; ‘Yes, go on,’ he encouraged them. ‘I’m sure it’ll be lovely.’; This seemed to spark them into life. They drew closer to each other, clutchin one another by the hand.; ‘Whatever you say,’ said the tallest one, looking straight into Matt’s eyes. The kids exchanged glances, and started to sing: ‘Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us…’; Bloody Hell. I felt my face goin red. I were gonna laugh out loud. I managed to keep it in. My husband, do you know what? He din’t even get it! He listened, kind of entranced, cos, I ain’t gonna lie, their singing weren’t bad. I’d even go so far as to say, it were nice. At the end of the song, Matt reached into his pocket and pulled out a fiver. ‘What are you raising money for?’ he asked the boy.; The lad looked dazed. He stared around him wildly. His eyes alit on that little girl what were holding his hand. ‘Orphans,’ he burst out with. ‘Yes, little orphans.’; The little girl smiled up at him. God, she were a bit of a looker apart from the fact she din’t seem to have no eyelashes. Same cheekbones, but a reddish tinge to the hair pokin out of her hood.; ‘Oh, OK,’ said Matt, absently. ‘Thanks very much.’ He looked at them, puzzled, because they was all just standing there staring at him like they’d been brained or somethin. ‘Run along,’ he said briskly, ‘and keep singing’ he added. ‘You never know, you could turn professional if you worked at it.’; They was still all staring at him with a deep longing, like they was all on the point of saying somethin, but didn’t quite know what to say. They was hangin on his every word, that’s for sure.; ‘Yes, well, just….never give up! That’s my advice to you!’ said Matt cheerily. ‘That was lovely, thank you,’ and he shut the door.; We went into the kitchen and put the kettle on. ‘They were a bit odd, weren’t they?’ Matt mused.; ‘Nah, looked pretty normal to me.’ I said. ‘Now, I been thinkin about painting the units in here a sort of pale green……’; ‘Shardie! They were! They were very weird. So blond. So pale. So intense! Didn’t you think?’; ‘Nah,’ I replied. ‘They’re just after making theirselves a bit of money. Don’t worry about them.’ I massaged his neck as he sat there at the table. ‘Come on, let’s watch something on Netflix.’; I din’t know what to do about them kids. I were frankly at a loss. What could I do? Sometimes me mum says, ‘Shardie, sometimes there ain’t nothing you can do. If there ain’t nothing you can do, there ain’t nothing you can do.’ She’s right. Sometimes there just ain’t no way out. I realised it were only a matter of time until one of them kids got brave enough to tell me husband face-to-face that he were their father. But…how on earth did the little buggers find out? Had they felt it in their bones? Surely their mothers wouldn’t of told em.; Truth were, from my point of view, the best thing would be just to wipe them kids off of the face of the Earth. I thought about maybe asking em in the next time for a big jug of poisoned cocoa. Loool. Just thinkin about it makes me die laughin! It’s not as good an idea as it sounds though, as someone would probably trace it back to me and I don’t wanna end up in jail, I got things to do, places to go….; I thought maybe the best thing were to move. Move away somewhere where they couldn’t track us down. I started looking at properties in Scotland, Wales, as far away as I could get, like Wick. Matt thought it very strange, but I just told him I had a strange hankerin to live in the country.; But you know, I suddenly remembered that I had decided I weren’t gonna be bothered with, what was it again, oh yeah, ‘consequences’, so…..I just weren’t. I just din’t think about it. I blanked the whole bloody thing from me mind. Whenever I started thinking, like ‘OMG what is going to happen here?’ I just made myself stop it and thought about happy things instead, like what colour statement wall I wanted in the bathroom and what lovely ponyskin wedges I wanted to buy next time I went London and the like. And when I did think of it in the middle of the night, I thought to meself, ‘At the end of the day, Shardie, it’s one big planet what we’re livin on. All them kids and me, we can learn to share. It don’t have to be a matter of me or them, them or me. We can co-exist like them native Americans had to when them explorers turned up.’ Pocahontas didn’t go shootin that John chap with her arrows when he turned up, now did she? No, she snogged him instead! Well, that’s one way of dealin with intruders!; And I weren’t so fast to open that door neither. I’d learnt me lesson. Several times in January the horde or some of em came back and knocked. I din’t answer. I just breathed real quiet, tiptoed to the peep-hole and peered out at them. Ugh, horrible creatures. It were a bit spooky really how much alike they was one to the other. Them fuckin cheekbones. Honest to God, sharp enough to cut.",0,1,0.05861868568423446
790,33,72,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Fred said there are soon going to be one-way trips to Mars, for colonisation purposes. I said, feeling kindly disposed, that I would not hold him back and that if he wanted to go, he should go, and that I would not mind accompanying him. He then said, ‘Yeah but, we would never be selected for a trip such as that.’ Oh, I thought. Shit. You’re right. Of course we wouldn’t. Those bloody selection processes are everywhere, aren’t they, scuppering so many people’s wondrous plans. For some reason this made me laugh and laugh. It was the thought of how we would fail on so many levels, if not every level: too old (both), a bit/quite/highly mad (me), blind in one eye (Fred), not likely to have children when we get there (me), too fat and not fit enough (both), possibly/probably cancerous (me), not flexible enough to get into the space-suit (Fred)….you could go on and on.; I went for a walk on Friday and we were talking about books again, and the shift that is happening. One lady told me that at the American school they are not teaching handwriting any more. Worrying. New generations are going to be entirely dependent upon their machines. Actual physical books, however much we love them, are beginning to look antiquated, anachronistic, oddly static. I feel like I am mourning their passing already. When you see piles of them for free outside Sainsbury’s don’t you just want to rescue them?; News Flash: My friend Janet is moving to a house in the middle of the countryside not far away from us. We are well excited as we will be able to go there by bike, probably with the dogs lolloping alongside, get pissed and bike back again, so pissed that we forget the dogs (which Janet and David did to us the first night we met, lol. We were like, oh, Boingo and Crow are staying over, OK!) We are going to do creativity workshops together. She will do ‘book transformation’ and I will do creative writing and whoever wants to can come along and do it with us. (ooh, sounds rude but isn’t.); OK, so here we have Shardonnay, Part 3.; It must be said me man is a bit of a looker. Oh yes. Even if you couldn’t tell yourself, you’d soon notice cos when you’re walkin along with him in town all the ladies’ heads turn. Don’t they just? And at a party if he’s chattin away to a couple of girls, oh, yes, they’ll be gigglin away, and givin him the eye. He’s just like…magnetic? You can’t help but look at him. Basically what I’m tryin to say is, he is eye-candy, big time. Ticks all the boxes: symmetrical features, tick, startling blue eyes, tick, faintly stubbled manly jaw, tick, even teeth, tick, fuckin heart-stoppin smile, big tick, oh yeah.; He’s so clever, he is, he’s like litrally on another planet most of the time, thinkin about maths and that. He loves his work, loves writin lectures for all the students, loves doin his research at the university. But most of all he loves me. When he first met me I were only seventeen and he were twenty three. He told me I were the most beautiful thing he ever saw in his life. He couldn’t keep his hands off of me! He were forever nuzzlin me boobs, strokin me hair. He tells me he were only half a man until he met me. Aaah! I put the light into his life, he says. In more ways than one, I think. I know how to look after a man. He leads one well cushy life. Oh, yeah, I give 110 percent to the job. He is one lucky guy.; I make everything nice for him. I take his suits to the cleaners, I iron his clothes and put them away all nice. I personally am one of them people what like everything to be just so, clean and tidy. If you were to see our house, you would see for yourself: it is lovely, every detail. There’s always big lilies in all the vases, I polish the floors, I dust all the frames, I shine the mirrors, I make sure the window-cleaners have been round. We got a lovely big lounge with a massive settee and a big real fire what you can turn on with a switch. Our TV screen fills practically the whole of one wall. Big French windows lead onto a massive deck, a moss-free lawn, a pond with a fountain, me gnomes and me lion statues.; Our bedroom has the most largest en-suite you ever saw. It’s all colour-cordinated in mauves, greys and purples with them massive shiny black tiles round the walls. Me man has his own walk-in wardrobe with his suits all hanging there, pressed, his shoes all laid out nice, all polished and waiting for him. T-shirts and underwear are all sorted and neatly stacked.; All these little touches really do make a difference to a man’s life. I even fill up his car for him. I take the car for its MOT. I open his mail, take his cheques to the bank, massage his neck when he’s tired, run him a nice bubble bath, warm his dressin gown for him on the radiator. Really, what I’m tryin to say is, he is one lucky man. And you know, he should maybe have appreciated that a little bit more, you know what I’m sayin?; So anyway, nuff said, it’s all good, but it soon became obvious that most of Pat’s clients was pacifically requestin the superior love bullets of my drop-dead gorjuss fella. The word had got around as I’d been Pat’s regular supplier for years, since a coupla months after I met him. It didn’t help that them two kids conceived like five years before had turned out to be ruddy geniuses. The little girl were the pride of the pre-prep. She’d gone and won a drama prize, the maths cup, the science award, and she were only five. She even wrote a little article what got printed in the paper. And the boy, conceived by a different mum, were the fastest runner in the infant school, had his picture in the paper every week with his football team, came top of the class in every subject. They was legendary! Famous.; And them triplets what I were telling you about. OMG. One of them only said his first word at four months! ‘Tractor,’ he said, and that is a difficult word for a baby. The others wasn’t far behind neither. ‘MY dolly,’ I heard the baby girl saying when she were five months old. Thing is, you know, people want clever kids. It ain’t gonna be no effort for them little chaps to get their GCSEs is it? Piece a piss. They’ll probably go to uni and that, like no sweat. One of em’ll probably be the Prime Minister for all I know.; Anyway what I’m saying is, I done a service to the world, by bringing them into it. To be totally honest with ya, sometimes I do like feel a teensy twinge of like, what is it? Guilt, maybe? But I push it away so quick I hardly feel it. No, the real crux of the matter is: Matt should never of pissed me off and then I never woulda done all this. Not being funny but it’s a bit of a no-brainer, that. Anyone in their right mind could see he’d brung it on hisself.; So I opened up the door one day to a tall, rather hunky teenager wrapped up in a big woolly snood. Ooh, bit of a looker, bit of alright, I ain’t gonna lie. Longish blond kinda windswept hair. Musta been about fourteen.; ‘What is it?’ I said.; ‘Erm…does Matthew Stern live here?’ he asked, just like that, the cheeky bugger. Oh, Jesus! Just like that I understood who he were. He had the lip, he had the eyes, he had the flash a purple. It all stood out a mile.; ‘No, he don’t,’ I snapped and slammed the door in his pretty face.; A couple of weeks later I opened up to a couple of gorgeous girls. Little snub noses, rosy cheeks. They was wearing matching furry Russian hats. Their hair were like silver straw.; ‘Excuse me,’ one of em stammered. ‘We’re just wondering….we just heard….maybe…does our dad live here?’; ‘Not on your life, Nellie,’ I rasped, prising their fingers off of the door-jamb.; I leant on the wall once they’d gone, breathing heavy like. My heart had gone all of a flutter. I felt like I were gonna pass out. Little upstarts. How dare they? Come round here tryina get me stuff off of me no doubt. Hunh. Little bastards.",0,1,0.15902797819464487
791,33,73,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Little snippets of news for you before you get the next installment of The World According to Shardonnay.; Firstly, Fred got a job! I got it for him actually. Being fed up of him ligging around, Chloe and I performed one of the spells in the Tibetan Book of Positive Thinking. You smear butter on your forehead, sprinkle oats on your chest and earth on your feet and clap loudly whilst affirming what you want to happen. This apparently awakens your ‘lu’ and ‘sok’ and purifies your ‘wangthang’. Who knows how it does this but FACT: Fred got four job offers the next day. So if you need something badly just put it in the comments and I will give it a go for you. Fred does not believe me when I told him I got him the job. He says, ‘yeah, well, I did send an email round.’ Poor lad does not realise his wangthang is now zinging about the planet, free as a bird.; Anyway this job thing came none too soon, as money reserves were running low and there is still that matter of the unpaid 2010 tax bill. The bailiffs did come round (don’t tell Gwanny) but luckily I was out. If I’d been in I would have offered them the parrots, who, as you know, are vicious little buggers and would’ve conveniently ripped their fingers off. Anyway, no matter, Fred’s been to TaxAssist and they are sorting it out. We just mustn’t spend anything for about two years.; No news on the Miss Benyon front. She had promised me a nipple appointment in Jan, but I guess that’s not gonna happen. Maybe over Christmas someone pointed out to her that her Google presence is entirely dominated by crazed boob blog fan’s musings and she has decided to punish me by with-holding the nipple. If I do get an appointment though, Claire is going to get the day off work to come with me and get a photo for you guys.; Anyway, back to the craze of the moment: Shardonnay is here! One of me readers says she is ‘women’s lib gone badly wrong.’ Ha ha.; Me and Shelley and Debs all donated to Pat’s sperm factory every day, at least once. This meant we earnt quite a lot of money. Like three hundred quid a day! We would meet early after the morning donation, go into Baroosh for a coffee, drive to Harlow, go shopping in Matalan or TKMax or Primark, come back and try on all our new clothes, go out for cocktails around five and be back in time for another donation around seven. This way, our blokes was all satisfied and never gave no trouble.; Hmm, those were the days! Spunky times! Loved it. Don’t regret any of it for a second. Shelley once said, ‘Don’t you ever think it might all come back at us?’; I were like, ‘No. Any kids what get made can’t prove it were us.’; ‘They got that DNA testin though, now?’; ‘Hm,’ I said, ‘Yeah, but you have to like get the DNA of the dad, doncha? I don’t see no kids coming round asking for a sample of Matt’s hair, do you?’ I cackled me big cackle. ‘Anyway, the tosser pissed me off with keeping that bitch ex of his on his phone. He deserves a bit of hassle in his life, the bastard.’; ‘But do you ever think he might find out?’; ‘Nah! Anyway, don’t care if he does, the tosser. She were such a flat-chested freak, his wife. It weren’t like I never warned him! I says to him, I says, ‘Matt, if you keep her on your phone, I’m not gonna be happy.’ And blow me if I don’t find he’d been textin her and all.’; Anyway, us three girls saved up six grand over the first six months and went and booked boob jobs at the Rivers. I chose to have an E cup. Gorgeous they are. Lush. And it means it’s even easier to get Matt to cough up the goods every morning and evening. Ha ha.; So then Pat says to me she says, ‘I need more, Shardonnay. A lot of my clients are askin for tall blond clever kids.’; ‘Well, yeah, course they are,’ I agreed. ‘But I am a lady wot lunches, me! Can I be bovvered to come back in the middle of the day to do another blinkin blow-job?’; ‘Shardonnay,’ she says, all serious, ‘I’ll give you two hundred for the lunch-time one.’; ‘Pat!’ I says. ‘He already thinks I’m a nympho!’; ‘The posh mums are after it,’ she goes.; ‘Hunh, course they are,’ I says to meself. Everyone knew Matt’s spunk made the best babies. ‘Oh, all right,’ I says.; Bit of a bind to tell you the truth. I’d prefer to be ordering me battered fish or onion rings down the Star or the Crown and they do a lovely roast in the Boar’s Head. But bless him, Matt would deliver every time. Nice and fresh, creamy custard. Bit of alright. And I got time to grab a quick lunch in the caff around two.; Thing is, Matt’s magnificent seed had started to get a bit of a reputation around town. It all began with one of Pat’s clients having twins. OMG though, gorjuss or what? They was cherubic, chubby, chuckly. Everyone adored em. It were obvious soon as I saw em that they was Matt’s. The upper lip gave it away. Matt’s lip is kinda, well, muscly, twitchy almost, but in a good way. And their hair…. so blond it were blinding. After that, everyone looked at me in a different way, like with awe. It’s like, I had the power, or something? I didn’t mind that, I’m proud of me man. And I deserve him too, I am one classy bird.; So I really started churning it out to keep up with demand. I were earning five hundred a day by this time. I got meself a new car, a soft-top jag, lovely metallic blue. I even had a personalised numberplate. SSS77. Shardonnay Simone Stern. And seven is my favourite number like David Beckham, so I got it twice. When Matt asked how I suddenly had so much money, I just said I’d had it all along sittin in a forgotten old Lloyds bank account.; Then things got even more intense. Cos that lovely tall lady what looks like Phoebe out of Friends, she only went and had triplets, didn’t she? Lush. You’d see gaggles of women in the street staring open-mouthed at them babies. Their eyes was so blue, so blue, I can’t explain. Almost like there were a flash of purple in them. And they looked wise, like they was thinking about the universe and why we’re here and all that fancy stuff! Bless em, so that caused a bit of a flurry round the town.; Oh, it did make me laugh! Honest to God, every day I had meself a good old chuckle about all them babies and how Matt never had an effing clue. What a hoot. And whenever anyone said that word: consequences, to me, I just laughed in their face. Partly because I din’t know what the bloody word meant. But I got the idea it were to do with the future and it were NOT GOOD.; ‘Look, who bloody cares?’ I would say to them. ‘YOLO,’ I would say. This means ‘You Only Live Once.’ And my life is so much better now I can buy lovely quality clothes, take Debs and Shelley out for Mojitos every day, order champagne on the internet. I got meself Netflix, I got an i-phone, I got me fancy car. God knows, I din’t want no kids meself. Too much bloody work, I said to meself. I were also thinking about a hot tub. I got the brochures, I were just ditherin between a Norwegian pine sort of look or a more sleek modern look.; And who would have thought it? You know, me? Little me, who never had nothin. Now I could have anything I wanted. And all for a teensy bit of man-milk each day, which, I hasten to add, he were giving to me voluntarily. Did he ever complain? Nah, he did not. So there you have your answer. Were I gonna feel bad? Not one bit of it. No sirree.",0,1,0.10723648487823743
792,33,74,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"I had some good news. The short story I put in for the Bishops Stortford College Festival of Literature Short Story Competition has been short-listed! Due to its ‘adult content’ he he you know me! it cannot be displayed in Waterstones nor in the Library nor in the school Library. No matter, it is on the Bishops Stortford Observer’s web-page and you can see it and the other short-listed entries here. There is a WARNING in capitals what makes me laugh.; I was very cheered to be short-listed. I know it is a little local competition and everything but it is a wonderful feeling to have your work appreciated even so. I am all zingy with excitement. And people keep stopping me in town to say how much they loved the story!; It cheered me so much that I decided to make more of the story. It feels so much like a Chapter 1. So, I might not have done no bloggin over the last three weeks but that is because I now have 32 chapters of ‘The World According to Shardonnay.’ And I’m telling you, I ain’t never had so much fun in my life.; Forgive me if I am talkin a bit weird. I been thinkin in me new character’s voice so much that now I can’t speak right no more. My friend Cath inspired me to do this. Years ago, I saw her at the school gate flouncing about with a feather boa, sneering at the other mothers. ‘Cath, are you alright?’ I asked her. ‘Just getting into character, dahling,’ she replied with a bitchy flourish and a vicious eyebrow put-down. She was about to play that cow what is the Baroness in the Sound of Music and did an incredible job. So, yes, whichever character you are tryin to work out, just become her or him for a few days or weeks. You might end up with no mates, but you will deliver a sizzling performance. So do forgive me if I don’t get me punctuation right, but I have been getting inside the mind of Shardonnay.",0,1,0.14070835078899593
793,33,75,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"So much has been going on, it’s almost impossible to keep up with it all. I’ll start with the best thing first. On Thursday I went to see the oncologist, Dr Abrahams. She showed me the report from the CT scan of my lungs. The nodules are exactly the same as they were six months ago. This means it is highly unlikely that they are cancer. This is the best Christmas present and means I can carry on tumbling headlong into raucously fun situations. (Although I don’t and won’t forget that as I am being spared, some other poor person is not.); Went for another ECG on Christmas Eve, as they have to check your heart every so often if you are on Herceptin. As I came out, I passed the stairs to Clinic 7, Miss Benyon’s clinic. I sighed with a sad longing. I have been having withdrawal symptoms.; The best thing about our wee trip to Paris was staying with my cousin Kate in her groovy house. She told me something very funny. You know how Gwanny has always gone on about being a poor wee thing, the seventh and last child in her family, a twin with great big Bobby who kicked her in the womb, and makes out she suffered dreadfully at the hands of her bigger siblings? Well, Kate told me that when Bill Scotter, her father, was wooing her mother, Jean, the eldest of JeanDavidJimmyKayMegBobbyLinty, he would turn up at the manse, all smart, and naughty Bobby and Linty would be hiding in a bush, spitting at him like little wildcats as he walked by. So funny to have another perspective on the story.; I went out for drinks with the Rusty Old Springs. Well, only Juicy Lucy this time and my sister, and Nellen. After quite a few pints we fell out into the street and Chloe phoned from Boston saying she’d missed her flight and it could cost £1000 to get home. I had had it up to here with teenagers for the day, as I’d been at the hospital all day for oncology and Herceptin and no one had done a darn thing to keep the house ticking over, so I shouted a bit, it must be admitted. Missing flights is just inexcusable. You have to check and check and get there ridiculously early, yes you do. Normal people just do. I fear I went off on one slightly.; So Chloe went round the airport trying to find someone who could help. All the stewardesses were blank and robotic. She asked to speak to the top boss but they wouldn’t let her. So she wandered about, hapless and crying. A portly man in a red suit with a neat white beard and hair materialised in front of her and said, ‘Hey kiddo, do you need help?’; Chloe explained her sad plight and that her mother was an angry loon. ‘I am the managing director of Delta,’ said the man. ‘I will get you on a flight tomorrow for free.’; Chloe looked at him wonderingly through her dripping mascara and asked him, ‘Are you Father Christmas?’; She made it home the next day.; Tabby got her i-phone nicked from a club in Newmarket. I always say if she had a groovy crocheted pouch like me this would never happen to her, but does she listen to me? At three in the morning her friend Naomi said to her ‘You should have got that ‘Find my i-phone’ thing set up on your phone.’; ‘Oh,’ said Tabby, ‘I think I actually did do that!’; Within minutes, they could see the location of the phone on google maps. It was in a house in Bury St Edmunds. You could even see which room in the house it was in! Bit scary really these tracker things. Honest, makes me think I’m definitely never gonna nick no i-phones. It turned out the person who had it had found it abandoned in the gutter and she managed to contact Tabby’s friend on facebook as her name had come up on a text on the front of the phone. So we got the phone back.; Anyway, we went to another fabby party last night. Honestly, tis the season to be merry, fala lala laaa lala lala. As the noise levels rose (we were on Bailey’s) we got onto the subject of the ‘No more Page 3‘ campaign. Recently I read on the campaign’s facebook page a rant by ‘howtostartasexualrevolution’. Here is a quote from the article which put things very clearly, I think:; ‘A barrister who practices family law sent me this, unsolicited:; ‘I cannot think of one case where, if parents were to expose their children to ‘soft’ pornographic images of women’s breasts, every single day, even if it is just one image, day after day, the court would not be critically concerned and social services would not seek to remove a child into care.; And in particular, if that parent failed to recognise the potential harmful consequences for a child, maybe even describing it as ‘harmless fun’, I also expect that child may remain in long term foster care or possibly even an adoptive placement.; BUT, if we call it Page 3 and show it to our nation’s children, day after day, on news stands, in cafes, in doctor’s waiting rooms, dentists and supermarkets, we say it is ok… well it is not. It is time to say No to Page 3 once and for all.’ ‘; So at the party we agreed that all the campaign needs is a daring stunt. And what better way to emphasise the sexual inequality of the thing than by pasting pictures of big c**ks and b*lls over Page 3? We could have inane topical quotes from ‘Darren, 18, from Harlow,’ like, ‘I like to prepare my own meat and two veg for Crimbo!’; Someone said that, you know, we could have one day tits, the next balls. We decided ‘Monday c**k, Tuesday tits, Wednesday c**k, Thursday tits, Friday c**k, Saturday tits, Sunday c**k.’ (I don’t know why I think it’s OK to put the word ‘Tits’ but use stars for the word C**k?) This would have been alright if it had been a whispered conversation but oh no, we were yelling all this at the top of our lungs. Someone else suggested us having a ‘tits edition’ and a ‘cock edition’ (oops forgot the stars!) so you could choose. I pointed out though that we need one hell of a lot of c**k to make up for the ‘litrally’ decades of tits.; Someone else said all we had to do was wait for Murdoch to die and then things will change anyway. But that’s just wrong. Why should we have to wait for him to die? Barney says that it’s not a big deal and newspapers are on the way out so why bother? Some say why shouldn’t girls earn a few bob from their assets? I say, along with quite a lot of others, that of course they can, but it should be on the top shelf for adults who choose to look at it. I don’t like the fact that little kids in the caffs all over Britain turn that first page and are presented with tits and naff quotes. What do they learn from this? And I must find that photo of the Sun giving away free Lego toys. Oh, here it is: Just look at that: ‘We have teamed up with Lego UK to offer every Sun reader a free Lego toy….’ !!!!!! like, WHAT? How old do you have to be to still want Lego toys? To get the toy you have to find and cut out the voucher every day, so the little kids are basically not going to avoid having them tits in their face, are they? You can just imagine some little three, four or five-year-old Matthew or Milly saying, ‘come on Daddy, let’s go out and buy the Sun so I can get my free toy.’; And when Matthew or Milly asks, ‘Hey Dad, why has that lady not got any top on?’ what does the average Daddy reply, I wonder? ‘Blokes like to see a fresh pair of tits every day, son,’ and, probably, ‘Hmm, I’m not at all sure, Milly, now you mention it.’; I wonder even more what will the little kid will ask Daddy when they see a big c**k and balls staring them in the face? And what will shocked Daddy say then? Will he say, ‘It’s OK, son: Darren, 18, from Harlow, needs to earn a few bob? And cor, look at how nice and firm those bollocks are?’; One woman on the No More Page 3 facebook page has been turning every Sun she sees inside out. I want to go further. Pasting in some disturbing young c**k might be the only way.; So, a call to arms: come on, girls, who’s with us? Shall we head down Tesco’s one day/every day, buy up all the copies of the Sun, (so we can’t be accused of defacing anyone else’s property) take them out to the car-park, wield our Pritt sticks enthusiastically and stick Darren, 18, or Tim, 21, or Adrian, 19, on there in all their glory? Then shove them back in the pile and wait, cameras at the ready, to capture the facial expressions of the customers as they turn the page. Ha ha.; My next post will, I hope, include my first sketch, brought to life by Tabby. She gave me a present today, of the blog all printed out and stuck into a book. Wow, the blog has turned out to be a mega book! Although she complains that as I keep posting, her work is never done.; So, it’s Christmas Day and Joey, GrandAlf, Bash, Tabs and Graham are playing Game of Life. Bash is smiling even though she is living in a caravan and earning 20,000 every payday compared to Tabby who was earning 90,000. I asked Graham why he had his head in his hands. He said, ‘Life’s just like that.’ Everyone else has passed out. You can just see Fred snoring on the sofa behind Tabby (due to that rather mahoosive empty bottle of red you see before you.) Christmas Greetings to All!; It’s now a few days later and the big room has been transformed back into rehearsal space for the Pandora’s Box Reunion Gig, which is tonight, at the Half Moon pub down the hill.; Very exciting although Chloe has lost her voice! She’s been looking for it all day though it’s such a bloody mess in her room it’ll be a miracle if she finds it. As soon as she got home, her enormous suitcase just exploded in the middle of her room and the contents have lain there ever since.; Anyway, ginger, turmeric, raspberry leaf tea and aspirin have been wielded. Went to see Dennis last night to get her healed. He healed my sister too. Good work, Dennis. Mmm, the atmosphere around him as he is healing is dreamy. The world of angels is full of a deep and wonderful peace.",0,1,0.05182895048566689
794,33,76,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"This post is from a week ago! Sorry, just didn’t manage to post it before the Paris jaunt. Up-to-date Christmas one coming in like an hour, despair not!; Normal physical life has resumed. I have restarted yoga, have been to pilates with Claire and Mad Lucy, have slipped about on mud and ice in the woods with the dogs and climbed trees with Bashi. Huggi too has miraculously recovered from a serious operation on his bum (£1500 don’t tell Gwanny) but as soon as he was off his lead again he just couldn’t stop himself going after a rabbit and dislocated his toe. I ask you! Don’t ever get a lurcher. They’re just too…..flimsy.; I am on the BS Musical Theatre Company committee and the Bollywood Nights Hockerill fundraiser committee which saw me in a sari handing out leaflets at the Christmas market (16th March if you would like to come! Never pass up on an opportunity to plug your event.) You should have seen me, Fred and the internet trying to get the sari on. Er…slight mind-fuck. They’re about fifty metres long. Phoned Arulesh in a panic. She pleated, ruffled, folded and swirled it in no time. Oh, all right, I’ll show you me in my sari!; I have been looking after Bash who missed the whole last week of school with flu. We are trying to get her better in time for a quick jaunt with Bashi’s fwend and Tabby to Paris on the Eurostar. We have been drinking Echinacea and popping Radiance berry vitamin pills along with kiwis and an incredibly viscous Chinese cough medicine. Fred has had flu too. I asked him if he had had some Chinese cough medicine. He said ‘I got bored waiting for it to come out of the bottle, so no.’ We should show it to Grampa. He absolutely loves viscous things. His only invention ever has been a syrup machine, where a spinning rolling pin picks up a layer of syrup and mysterious (to us lay-people) rings appear on it as the rolling pin spins faster.; If you change the speed of the spinning, the rings move in and out. Unfortunately the syrup machine proved to be spectacularly useless. But as children we all loved watching the rings moving in and out. And Grampa made sure we never dropped golden syrup off our spoons: you must learn to assess viscosity to see how fast to turn the spoon to avoid drips. If you are interested, you can read more about the syrup machine here. Ooh, my nephew Joey has just thought of a use for it: he says it could be like a chocolate fountain, but instead of dipping your marshmallow into melted chocolate you would dip it into the spinning syrup! Best try this slowly, or the syrup will drag your marshmallow away methinks.; We are planning on walking up to the Sacre Coeur and taking the Batobus from Notre Dame to the Eiffel Tower. We are also going to Maisons Laffitte to visit Catherine who helped us with Siffo and Princey when they lived in her stables. We will go to the Creperie ‘La Bonne Humeur’ in the market square, which is our favourite place ever (due to the bols de cidre and the popcorn, the crepes oeuf fromage, and the crepes grand-marnier).; Alfie’s fwends Sammy Wammy and Roberto are staying. Sammy Wammy got very excited on his way downstairs this morning because he heard clucky clucky noises and seriously thought we had some new chickens. I have been teaching the parrots to make clucky clucky noises for some time so, RESULT. They can do chickens, cuckoos, sparrows, owls and of course, their whistled scales and arpeggios. They have recently learnt the first line of my flute pupil Katie’s piece as well.; Fred has had Torro out on the kitchen table to train him to count by picking up the egg-cup with one, two or three peanuts underneath. Come on Torro, we need two peanuts now.; Mad Lucy came round for vodka last night. I told her about the surprise 2010 tax bill that came through the door. She said, ‘Well, you have to have something round here that you could sell.’ We looked around. ‘Um, actually, no,’ we agreed, ‘there’s litrally like nothing worth anything in this house.’; ‘Ooh…except the parrots,’ I remembered. ‘Even with no words they’re worth seven hundred quid and every time they learn a new word, they go up by fifty quid.’; ‘Did you hear that?’ Mad Lucy asked them, then let out a greedy chuckle. ‘Ha ha, losers: we’re going to SELL YOU for lots of dosh!’; Torro fixed her with his beady eye and muttered a curse that only he knows based on the Radio 4 hourly beeps. Poor Mad Lucy litrally one minute later succumbed to the dreaded lurgy that’s going round, threw up twice and had to lurch home. Good work, crazy voodoo bird! Claire however takes the vomming prize, as on the night of the barrel of beer party she went out for a posh meal in London, overindulged slightly and threw up at Tottenham Hale! The most expensive vom she’s ever had, she claims. Why all the throwing up, you may well ask. I haven’t a clue. It’s the end of the year, I guess, and we have to do these things. At the end of next week the Rusty Old Springs are going out for their Christmas drinks, can’t wait, so more vomming might be on the agenda. Will we have learnt our lesson?….Hmm, I suspect not. If you haven’t learnt it by 46 when the hell are you going to learn it?; We are going out tonight, to a party. Unfortunately it’s the same night that Alfie has decided to have a what he calls ‘Gathering.’ He is out in the garden preparing by chopping wood for the fire with Sammy Wammy and Roberto. (Only because Fred said he had to. He’ll probably chop his thumb off.) Alfie knows to avoid the word ‘Party’ in case we freak out. Not that we are very paranoid people but last time someone did set off the fire extinguisher and every vom bucket got vommed in. But, chuckle chuckle you will love this: Fred has been busy planting a secret web-cam at the top of the big room, so when we are out we can watch what is going on back home on Fred’s phone, and probably thus entertain the people at the party we are going to. Ooh that would make quite a good start to a novel, wouldn’t it? The parents at a party getting more and more wasted as they watch the kids back home getting out of their faces and wrecking the house.; Must admit, did not manage a whole 50,000 words for Nanowrimo. Never mind. I did get 12,000 words of the sperm book and 10,000 words of sketches for Youtube done. And since the first December have been writing the skeleton of TITS: the Musical. My friend Caroline who is an actor says you don’t need more than five people in the cast. I know what she means but ooh, tricky, with such a vast cast of characters, including fifty women with their tits out and a team of crusties running the factory not to mention the con-man, the homeopath, the baddie and his lab team, his lollipop-lady girlfriend, the ill man in the hospital who helps to gather the ill-milk and the dying niece. Is it really possible to quadruple up parts without the audience getting confused? I can almost envisage doing it with a cast of ten. And musicians on top of that.; I could not do the blog for ages. Sorry. Must be because blogging is a response to pain and anguish but I’ve truly shifted back into normal life. Should maybe draw a line under it. Thing is, ‘The Breast Blog in the World‘ is just such a good title, I don’t want to give it up. I could move on to a new chapter of plain (or not so plain, we will see, won’t we?) ‘life as it is’ posts, and call it ‘A Breast of the Times,’ like the tits book. Will ask Fred how to do it for the New Year.; Have not forgotten to say ‘Happy Christmas’ to you all and thanks for reading all this maniacal rubbish over the last ten months. Had really lots of fun and therapy writing it all. But will say it properly in the next blog which will be posted in an hour or so. Lots of Love. Didn’t send any cards this year, so All the Best for 2013.",0,1,0.061193641264395984
795,33,77,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Tuesday: It’s a very odd experience this nanowrimo thing. 50,000 words is beyond me, that’s for sure. Am on 20,000. Managed to get down 6000 words yesterday. Don’t really know how, but the truth is, now that I’ve got them down, ideas are burgeoning, flocking. To my utmost surprise I appear to be writing a religious allegory. How on earth? Maybe some force is working through me. It is refreshing though just to write and write hardly going back to correct even typos.; Maybe I will give you some more pictures of Tabby’s faces today as we all need cheering up because the weather is bloody awful. I found them on her wall. Ben of postcard fame – (only one though come to think of it. Come on Ben surely you can manage another?) took them. He he, they were too good to languish on a lonely wall.; He he, here they are: Enjoy. This one is: ‘Smiling at a Passer-by.’ (These are all named by Ben.); This one is: ‘Just chillin in the car.’; This one is ‘Making an effort for a day out’:; This one is: ‘Appreciating an artist’s work’:; I am writing some comic sketches which I am hoping Tabby will do for me in the holidays. Will have to bribe her obv. She is not one to give of her more revolting talents for free.; I met Janet for lunch at a Mexican near Trafalgar Square. They mash the avocados up with the chilli and coriander at your table. Janet had a couple of lovely friends with her from her MA in Book Art. Book Art is a huge thing now apparently. You make art out of old books, take inspiration from them, explore the concept of them. It’s all about connecting with people and connecting with the past and future, or something! We wandered up Charing Cross Road and browsed in a second-hand bookshop. I could have stayed in there for hours, just for the crackly smell of ideas.; We were talking about writing. One of Janet’s friends says that when they are seeking a narrator for their novel, they audition different narrators in their mind. I have been doing this ever since with various characters. I have decided to rewrite the tits book from the point of view of one of the crusty factory workers, because she absolutely beasted her audition. And omnipresent third-person narration does seem more artificial than first person which is so simple, direct, richer in tone. Only thing is, first person crucially limits the point of view so that, in the case of the tits book for example, my readers will not see inside the baddie’s head, which is why authors then turn to multi-first-person, a chapter-each-type-thing, which I don’t really like because just as you are getting into one narrator you then have to get used to another.; Something NOT GOOD: on the way back, going up a tube escalator, I saw a poster that said, ‘He fathered 533 kids!’ with a picture of a surprised-looking dad. It’s a film called ‘Starbuck’ that was made in Canada. Bollox. Of course, my sperm book has been done. Still, everyone is saying to me ‘there are many ways to skin a cat.’ Hate that expression but you can see what it means. And it’s all in the delivery, the setting, the tone, I know, I know. Of course it would be arrogant to think that you can own an original idea these days wot with all the peeps in the world. And of course all those blokes going into the sperm banks and wanking into their little pots, they must have given plenty of thought over the years to the zillions of varying plots based upon the whole weird business.; Another problem with my sperm book was, (and this is what many authors find after a few weeks of struggle) the bloody characters have started rebelling and doing their own thing. The leader of the Heavenly Throng Sperm Gang, Holy Sebastian, only went and got himself shot! Silly boy. It’s really messed up the plot now. He was crucial to its development. However, tussling with a novel is really to be recommended if you don’t mind your head being done in.; All this week it has been the Hockerill Festival of World Literature. I went to see Andy Mulligan talk about his books. He went to work in Manila in the Philippines. He told us the islands were most beautiful place and that you should definitely go there if you ever go on your honeymoon. But he said Manila itself has the hugest, stinkiest rubbish dump he had ever seen. You look into it and think you can spot rats moving about. Then you think maybe it’s pigs. Then, with a dawning awareness, you see it’s children, squirming about in the rubbish trying to find tiny pieces of useful things they can sell. This was the inspiration for his children’s thriller ‘Trash’, which has been translated into 25 languages and is being made into a film. He showed us photos of the dumps and sad cement coffins piled high in the streets. ‘If dead Pablo’s family can’t find the 100 dollars to keep his remains in there, they will just be scraped out and dumped in the puddles,’ he told us.; Later the same day I went to ‘Creating life-long learners,’ by Marilyn Brocklehurst, a librarian who is, to put it mildly, doolally about children’s books. She showed us some of the comically dreadful books that people send to her, and read us some of the wonderful ones. She said that when she was doing a postgrad in ‘Library’, she discovered, in the corner, a selection of the best ever children’s books. She had a look and realised she had read hardly any of them. Her mum had never read her a single book. Her dad had read her two books, Kidnapped when she was seven and Treasure Island when she was eight and that only because she was ill. So she set to and read all of the selection. She was so fascinated by them that she changed all her modules to focus entirely on children’s literature. Now people flock to her library in Norfolk asking for advice in how to get children to read. Of course, it’s about letting them choose, letting them be led by enjoyment, by the excitement in the story. She also said that if you see a little boy who is reading the Financial Times when he is four, don’t ever believe the parents who say, ‘Oh, we don’t know how he became such a reader, he just seemed to pick it up.’ No, she said, readers like that are created from being read to, from an interested adult bringing the books alive for them, bringing the story off the page.; OMG it was just so interesting. I’m going to another talk now: an evening of poetry and drama with Daljit Nagra. Whoop whoop. Gotta go, byeee!; Well that was also fascinating. Poems about identity. A really funny one about being embarrassed about your mum looking different from all the other mums. And poems written by the Creative Writing Club at Hockerill. I was astounded at the confidence they showed in their work. Three dancers interpreted the writing with swift, curving explorations of space.; Wed: Fred is off being Principal for the day! I know, it’s so quiet round here. Bizarre. Normally he is mooching around making tea. However, a good opportunity to keep at the parrots with my ‘Get a Job, Fred!’ Ha ha I bet it’s a laugh being a headmaster. Lucky Fred. He went off with a purple tie and a suit, looking incredibly smart and shaven.; Have just made bread. Three loaves. One for Meg over the road who has been ill, one for Karen at the ponies who has just moved house and one for us. Have also hand-washed the three lovely agnes b beanies that my cousin Kate sent. I am sending them back to her. It’s funny thinking that I don’t need them any more. When I had the cancer somehow I thought it was permanent. My friend Sam (Alfie’s friend Brandon’s mum) kept saying ‘You’ll get through this, soon it will all be over and you’ll be through it.’ She kept repeating it like a mantra and it was as if I couldn’t hear it. It’s like when you have lots of little children you can’t see how they will ever grow up. Eventually they do of course and then they’re suddenly gone.; A headhunter phoned Fred about a job in Abu-dabi. Mmm. Don’t know if can do. Twenty percent tax though. Could maybe pay off the house? But at what cost? Could wait for Chloe and Tabby to get back for the holidays and scarper to visit Fred. Or could hit the ponies over the head with a hammer, leave Alfie in boarding (as he’s halfway through his GCSEs), rent out the house and scarper with the dogs and cats and Bashi. But we love our school. We love our fwends. We love the ponies.; Don’t be silly: I wouldn’t really hit them with a hammer. I would get the vet to do the dirty.; It’s horrible having a pony put down. We had to do it with little Rocky. The knacker people were there with their van hovering like vultures. They kept offering to shoot him in the head. We said ‘No, the vet’s coming.’ They sat there silent, full of deadly purpose. Ugh. Amy, Rocky’s little pony friend came in to the stable and massaged Rocky on the neck with her teeth. Karen-at-the-ponies and I burst into tears and chucked back the Rescue Remedy. We gave Rocky Rescue Remedy too and massaged him til the vet came. ‘Lucky he’s already down,’ said Karen. ‘It’s worse if they have to fall. That horrible thud.’ (She had been through it before.); When my little flute pupils heard that Rocky had died they were incredibly, disproportionately upset. They wept and wailed and gnashed their teeth. Inez’s sister wrote a blotchy tear-stained letter to Rocky. It said, ‘You were the best pony ever. I loved you so much. I loved riding you and brushing you. You were so sweet.’ The letter rather hilariously ended, ‘Gotta go now! Byeeee!’ The farmer and his wife buried the letter with Rocky’s ashes.; I am reluctant to put Princey down before the time is right. He still seems quite chuffed with his life of escapism and mutual scratchy time with Siffo. Have to go out now in lashing rain to meet the vet for his third anti-lice injection.; Thursday: Today it was Barney’s mum’s funeral. The small church in Barton is unbelievable. My granny Emmeline and her mother Eleanor are buried there. 14th Century painted pictures on the stone walls. A beautiful carved and worn pulpit. Barney’s brother Alexander, who is a conductor in Brussels, had flown over a soprano from the opera. She sang Pie Jesu. Everyone cried it was just so moving. We went outside to see the coffin lowered into the ground beneath a pretty tree where Ann’s husband Patrick is buried. As the vicar said ‘Dust to dust, Ashes to ashes,’ I kid you not, there came a biblical mighty rushing wind. Gale force. The vicar had to shout to be heard. Golden leaves fled past and the sun broke through the clouds. Since reading Dennis’ book and talking lots to Dennis I have become much more likely to recognise the work of spirits. And even Barney, who is a stiff-upper lip sort of chap, realised that it was all coordinated by the mighty firmament. Fred just said, ‘Yes, it was very windy,’ but he never gets things like that.; You know, once, years ago, Barney came in for a drink at my mum’s house. My mum served nuts in a bowl with soft blue-grey swirls on it. Barney said, ‘My mum made that bowl.’ He looked under to check and there were her initials. Coincidences can be so odd. My friend Sue-over-the-fence told me years ago that she was going to St Albans for the day to visit a friend. I said I had a friend in St Albans too. Blow me if her friend was not the mother of my friend!; Anyway, so on Thursday evening, I went to see Diego Morani, this charismatic Italian, do a talk on Europe and Language. It was music to my ears, the whole thing. He is an interpreter for the European Commission and writes speeches for the commissioners. He said: ‘I am not a politician. I am not a historian. I am just a very creative explorer who is obsessed with language.’ Speaking in a heavy Italian accent but in exquisite English, he talked about how language is on the move. This phrase always reminds me of the beavers in Narnia saying that Aslan is on the move, and before you even know who Aslan is you get the shivers. Diego said that, in his view, there is no point in trying to resurrect old languages forcibly. You would have to do things with them to reimbue them with meaning, you’d have to work in them, do business and science in them. He said Latin is still alive in its evolved forms in no less than six European languages. He reminded us that a language goes on before us and after us. He talked about being defined by the languages we use, how we put on masks to switch languages. He said even our faces are shaped by our language. He said ‘Look, I have a very Italian face.’ He told us that at his work, they speak so many languages that every person in the group can speak their own language yet understand everyone else. Being a bit of a joker, he has created a new language called Europanto. It is like Franglais but with all the European languages, or at least all the ones you happen to know, all muddled in. The only rule, he said, is that it should be understood. If the person you are speaking to does not understand, you have got it wrong. He spoke to us in it. It was amazingly easy to understand. The effect was to do with the boundaries of different languages becoming smudged. About a rejection of purity maybe. A celebration of being part of a confusing, disparate whole. About Europe becoming one? I guess we’ll have to read his books to understand more. The blurring of boundaries reminded me of Janet’s current work where she is engaged in merging letters from the Arabic alphabet with letters from our alphabet.; Back on my Pure Synergy, I feel that everything is fitting together. I felt like he spoke only to me. This is being high. Ferg used to try to explain what being on a high was like. He almost could not bear the beauty of the lights of the fairground on the Downs. When we used to get stoned we felt like that. Still, party tonight to drink the barrel of beer won at auction! Seventy two pints of ale, here we come.; Ps. this is a picture of how Fred found the kitchen the morning after the last gin club! (Tidying up does not seem to be one of the ladies’ strengths during or after gin.) Oops. Don’t show Gwanny.",0,1,0.10758616309019535

I’m too sicca for sitting on spam for two hours. It’s payning. Infhackers get in all over. Every splay, every inf-lux point, wever lux it is, they know how to crack it.; Then, as happens every day, a zistance chap burst through our barriers. It’s become so normynorm it doesn’t even petriffy me any more, as they’re not violent, just trilly daygolass. This one had sal robes and a ragged darsk. He had no vadderdec at all, and no vadderangle what could be serned. ‘Be afeared!’ he screamed. ‘The nosing stards…feeding you falsinf. Don’t believe any mouthing spit they dix…’ I slipped to the back of the jop to squeeze my fliplarm. You’re nevah meant to touch zistance, it’s insanitary, because they live exo-exo and it’s not sprayed properion there. He threw himself into the street just before the spambort van came. They got him though, one with a Yolt and one with a bortgun. I held cushols over my darskiddensideflappas area, as bortgunscreams are quitenoying. We straightway put our florcuvva in the sinnerater and set the moppa to deepclense to kill the obvion crobes.; The whole flor would be awash with kems so I had a five mint break on the bench, enough time to spray sofner on my spikes. I vlombed them out and rearranged them around my whorl. I have really nice vressis as I always use trilly quality dishner. I watched people drong by. I troobi the rioty of styles.; A couple of men troed in, one wanting to try the new mote-trolled bouncing varectors and the other wantiing colour. I vised the first chap of the new ninety-degree vadderangle, and montred the other one the colour charts on the splay.; ‘That one’s sampa,’ he said, bluvponting a dirty green on the H row.; I tried not to say anything. We are told not to question the cuzmo, but sometimes, honestlon, you have to clamp your moufleur. ‘?Have you seen this rather fokka vlu though.’; ‘I troobi this H13 better. !Look. It’s got flash.’; ‘Hmm, that’s why it’s more spensive,’ I said. Flash is overrated I think, but it is like you’re getting two or three colours in one.; I started mixing the H13green for him. Shame he dinti troobi the vlu, as it would have looked sicca as a frame for his handsome vaddervanilli. I put the long stentions into a tray of H13. I then painted extra green onto his vressis ligently, wrapping each flairlock in voil and tying up the odd thin strand, which we did in silver. He waited, fabling to his friend, who was trying vadderangles with different mote-trolled varectors. They troobied the new angle. ‘It was tellment exo, and now it’s tellment in,’ vlatted the friend, having a little strut and looking into the mirruv at his vanilli ponting straight out.; ‘That’s the fashwerve for you,’ said Greenvressis.; ‘You’re litters bangup to the mint,’ I said to his friend. ‘In a couple of weeks you wonti see anyone with an upright, they’re like tellment over.’; I started tatching all Greenvressis’ stentions. It took yons as it’s fiddly vail. I siddered the vanilli. ‘You know, these green vressis might go siccon with one of our new vadderays.’; Greenvressis gave a little thrust. ‘Worth a try,’ he dixed.; I vlatted. These two were quite grooty. I troobied their willingness to speriment.; We tried out vadderays. The seventh or eighth reallon hanced his vanilli, splaying exo siccon from its vadderbase, in dark metallic grey. The metal weirdlon flected the shunting colours in the flash of the green. ‘Stylish,’ I cluded.; ‘Bang-up,’ agreed Greenvressis. ‘I’ll take it.’; ‘Very now,’ dixed his friend. ‘Oh Miley, I’m gonna have to have one of them little mouthers.’; I vlatted, to be polite, even though I didn’t troobi him swearing. ‘Everyone’s gonna want one by the end of the week.’; I stood back and siddered Greenvressis. ‘They might even zire them green vressis too. That whole onsomb might litters be the big shebang.’; Lollos. Thinking back, I realise I had nidea. I was one naïve little scrap. ?Didn’t have a cluebo in hellion, did I. !Nugh. !Easynough to dix that now.; Anyway, Greenvressis’ friend chose a silver vadderay with yellow pulse to montrup gainst his normous dark vaddervanilli.; Talika came over for a darskpeer. She winked her mouflaps. I was pleased, because she doesn’t give much praise.; ‘?You want bits, or likes,’ Greenvressis asked.; Bits is obvion more practical but I troobi likes better cos they come back at you more velochy. So Greenvressis and his mate, totally troobiflipped with their purchases, sferred me a dred-and-fifty likes but of course half of that straightdrongs to the salon and half of what’s left pays MileyMuns. So I was left with thirty seven likes. Not kak. Would pay the week’s rent on my partmo.",0,1,0.07770266842532465
799,33,80,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"We went to an Auction of Promises at Afie and Bashi’s school last weekend. Fred’s eye was caught by the lot ‘Principal for the Day.’ He decided to go up to £250 for this. The bidding went past that and he gave up. It was already up to £350. I could see he was a bit gutted. Then, lo and behold, the person who had bid three fifty pulled out, as did the person bidding £300. It was all collapsing like a house of cards. ‘Who bid two fifty?’ asked the auctioneer. Fred held up his number. ‘Going, going, gone!’; Wowzer, wowzer, Fred is headmaster for the day!!! Whoop whoop. What fun. He thinks it’s fate. He was suddenly swamped. Mates of Alfie’s coming up to ask if he could let them off school for that day. Lovely flirty (and probably drunk) ladies asking him if he’s going to introduce The Slipper for errant parents!? Mates of Bash wanting a ‘shout-out’ (whatever that is), or asking if he could decree that everyone must wear a ‘onesie’ that day, whatever that is. (oh, alright, I do know really, it’s a kind of big fleecy babygro.) He will probably ban French, German, Spanish and Japanese in favour of computer languages, Java, SQL, Scala and the like.; Oh, Fred says he wants to see how the school works, not just have a laugh. Ha ha, not possible, Fred! Too many people want to have a giggle on the back of it. I think he should take the parrots in with him and we should teach them a few things to say in advance. Like, ‘Detention!” or ‘We don’t need no Education.’; I suspect that on Fred’s Big Day, juggling will figure prominently, as will hacky sac, that game where you kick a beanbag around without letting it hit the floor. He says he is going to preach ‘Stillness of the Mind.’ He might tell them in assembly how for a couple of years he never went to school. He learnt most of what he knows from Open University programmes on the telly. He only eventually went back because the school threatened to fine his parents. Fred’s mum only found out Fred had got into Oxford when she went down town and bumped into one of her mates who’d seen it in the paper. Fred had not thought to explain to her what it meant. I’m not sure Fred knew what it meant. (Oh, Fred says he’s sure he didn’t know what it meant!); Must just let you in on how Fred’s dad met Fred’s mum. It was the beginning of November 1965. (Oh, wow btdubs, this means I was halfway through being a foetus in my mum’s tummy. Yeah, I know, it’s always all about me.) Alf was the best man at his mate’s wedding. Rene was chief bridesmaid. They got tipsy and ended up spending the night together. From Saturday to Wednesday they spent every minute together, whispering sweet nothings, I imagine. On that fourth day they agreed that it felt like they had known each other for years. Alf borrowed five quid off Rene’s mum, bought a ring and proposed. He made Rene promise to write to him, as he had to return to his army barracks in Germany the next day. They exchanged letters until February, then Rene’s letters stopped. Alf kept on writing. Rene did not reply. Alf was in despair. He wrote her a letter saying ‘Look, I don’t care what the problem is. Even if you’re pregnant, or whatever, just please write to me.’; She did. She told him she was pregnant and that her parents had convinced her that Alf wouldn’t want to be bothered. He replied, ‘Well, they’re wrong.’ He told her to get things ready for a few weeks time when he would have leave, and he would come back and they would get married. Rene did nothing simply because she did not believe him. He turned up at her house as he had said he would, but she was out at work. Nothing had been prepared. Alf did not give up. He marched in to her place of work and whisked her out of there. He organised everything in two days flat including the special licence, and they were married just like that. Rene accompanied him back to Germany and they lived in a hotel for a couple of months until they were granted married quarters. On August 3rd, Fred was born in the British Military Hospital, Rinteln.; Isn’t that just such an unlikely romantic tale? Well done, Grandalf, for believing in love and for going on to have Ray and Gwen and all those lovely grandchildren.; At the auction we were sitting next to Luke’s parents, and Sammy Wammy’s mum. They reminded us of how Alfie’s mates used to come over for Chloe’s tutorials in: ‘How to Pleasure a Woman.’ I would come home and find up to ten boys sitting on the kitchen benches, wide-eyed, catatonic in shock as Chloe relentlessly, nay graphically, expounded upon her theme.; Still whenever Chloe is home, Alfie turns up from school with maybe fifteen or eighteen lads, all hopeful that the legendary tutorials will take place. When I say that it’s possible she’s blowing their minds, (I mean, look at them, they’re out of their faces on information!) she says ‘Mum, men really need to know this stuff. The more men in the world who know it, the better.’; There you go. Education organically arising due to local need. Chloe should start charging for her sessions: she could make a packet. Some poor person at the auction paid £270 for a song-writing session with her! Lolzer. Let’s hope he or she gets a major hit out of it! Ooh, that would make a good story.; Oh, yes, talking of stories, both Hockerill College and The Bishops Stortford College have opened their short-story competitions. I love these. The first you’re allowed 1200 words for (that’s like three pages) and the second only 500 words (that’s a little bit over a page.) The Hockerill one is a ghost story and the College one has to include the text ‘Anyone could make that mistake once. But then he did it again.’ So far I’ve gone on to say ‘So I decided it was time to punish him. I started taking his sperm with increasing regularity.’ Hahaha. Love it. Whatever is she going to do with the sperm…..? (Hooray, it appears that I’ve finally moved on from Milk/Breast obsession to Sperm/Bollock obsession.) Anyway, that’s for another day. All will be revealed. But for now, busy busy busy! Bye folks.; Ps. Fred having no job means he is freed up for really important seasonal things: (the one on the left is an alley cat just in case you were wondering.)",0,1,0.09679731479558878
800,33,81,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"So, the last post apparently had too much swearing in it. Oops. I was over-excited with being in Greece. Anyway, it was only Gwanny who complained. Which is funny because when I was about fourteen and used to bring genteel ‘Perse School for Girls’ girls home for tea, we’d be sitting there all prim and proper talking about our Latin homework and my mum would start bashing the pans in the kitchen going ‘Och! Fuck, shit and ABORTION!’ Those poor girls probably never recovered.; Greece was the best break ever. I drove to Ligia and sat at my favourite taverna looking over the harbour. I ordered the sea bream, greek chips, tzatziki, greek salad and a carafe of rose. Having got up at four am and it now being around two in the afternoon English time, I was really hungry. I ate and ate, like I had never eaten before. The appetite for food and for life was tremendous. It was like the scene in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he finds the half crown, buys himself a bar of Whipple Scrumptious Fudge-mallow Delight and wolfs it all down. It makes him breathless with happiness. That was exactly it. I was breathless with happiness. I reached the house, ran down to the sea and had a long swim, the first swim the Beaut has ever had. Gingerly at first with my right arm, but very soon striking out strongly and turning my body every which way. I went back to the house and slept.; So, from Sunday to Thursday I was alone. I worked. I finished Dennis’ book and added fifteen scenes to my script. It’s mostly there, but needs to be in the right order. I realised I needed skilled help with it. Maybe I could order it by focusing on place. After all, my main arena is the village, with its farm, shop, school and pub. I also decided that not just Booby and Busty are going to defect to the other side; ALL THE MILKERS are going to defect, apart from the British Standard Handfuls, of course. Hetty is going to find them all, dying in a lab, overdosing on chemo, mega-pumps sucking them dry, their babies strapped down and howling. I would stop to muse upon all this while doing yoga on the balcony and going for swims. I was looking forward to picking my fwends up from the airport on Thursday night.; Now, really Claire should tell you the next bit in ‘The Worst Blog in the World,’ but she hasn’t started it yet, so I will: they were so excited to be going on holiday that they not-quite-accidentally got pissed at Gatwick at the fish bar, ordering two bottles of champagne with smoked salmon platters no less thus squandering all their holiday money. Jill is a wonderful influence, being a jet-setter of the highest order. She is also an incredible loon, managing to mislay her ticket, money, passport, boarding pass, everything, but nobody cared as they were having such a wonderful time already.; Can you see the strange, disembodied hand about to fondle Jill/Claire on the shoulder? (oh, Bash just pointed out that it’s someone’s hair in the background.); They had the plane to themselves, so had whole rows of seats to lie down in. Lush.; Their first day we explored the deserted west coast of the island: Pefkoulia, Kathisma and Porto Katsiki. The sea on that side is a truly intense turquoise. There are massive foamy breakers one of which knocked Mad Lucy over. She ingested a few pints of salty water and had to scurry off on her own to vom behind a rock. After that she felt better.; At Porto Katziki Claire and I leapt in with nothing on but I had to clutch the Beaut to me as it flobbled up and down alarmingly in the swell. If I hadn’t already been healed by Dennis though, I would have been healed by these waters. They have a magic energy. You can feel it soothing your spirit.; On the way home Jill started to fantasise about Greek chips, so we had quick gin in the dusk on our beach and then went into Lefkas town for a bit of shopping and tzatziki, salad, butter beans, chips, wine.; At four in the morning Jill woke up looking like she’d had a massive botox lip job gone wrong. She thought she was having an allergic reaction to something and was having a ‘death ensues, oh no, oh no,’ moment. I said it was bound to be a mozzie. I had seen it before, on Gavdhos, when Nellen had slathered mosquito repellent everywhere except her eyelids. She woke up in hysterics, unable to open her eyes and looking like a frog. So anyway, paranoid now, Jill carefully wrapped herself in the mosquito net and sat there reading her book. At a certain moment she realised to her utmost thrashing panic that the mosquito was inside the net with her. It took three of us to untangle her and restore her to calm.; The second day we started with Bougatsa, (a vanilla and cinnamon cream pie from the baker) for breakfast with yogurt, honey, peaches, grapes and muesli. Pouty Jill still looked like she was angling for a snog, but was fine otherwise.; We went to our beach with chairs, Jill’s lip, the Beaut, Claire’s turquoise toes, our books, the snorkelling stuff and a huge tray with pistachios, gin, tonic, ice, lemon, vodka and peach juice. Ooh, sounds like we’re playing ‘Granny went to Market and she bought…’, doesn’t it? We got our tits out and talked about the ‘no more Page 3‘ campaign which is on Facebook and has 46,000 signatures already. We drank and drank and snorkelled and snorkelled. Silver Sea Bream everywhere with their stiff, upright bodies. Little roundish black fish with neat curved fins: they look like swallows would look if they morphed into fish. Grey spotty slug-like fish basking on rocks. Mad Lucy would come across a wondrous shoal and you would hear these muffled ‘oooh!s’ and ‘aaah!s’ of appreciation through the snorkel. She would then look up, rip the pipe out of her mouth and shout ‘It’s a whole new world under here!’; We were trying to hold onto time. We were trying to make two days into twenty. It almost worked. That day went on and on. As we got more drunk the clothes became more scarce until we had none. Well, Claire had none. (I had to protect the Beaut from the sun.) We watched her white bum looming about as she snorkelled. She would occasionally pop her head up to say ‘I am a mermaid!’ The chaps packing up the beach bar applauded as her naked form came out of the water. It all fitted in with the ‘No more Page 3’ theme, but we were too drunk to know how, and even now I’m not sure.; Claire was very pleased that her turquoise nail varnish was the same colour as the sea.; We ate in Ligia. Jill thought she saw the moon but it turned out to be a tin lamp. (She’s a bit blind poor thing.) We had lemony fish soup with a big chunk of tender sea bass in it. Apparently I upset the table next to us by talking about TITS and probably other terrible things too loudly. The waiter brought us cake of course, and some ‘rosoli’, a brandy with cinnamon. We loved it so loudly he brought us the whole bottle.; On being asked for her boarding pass, Jill dropped hundreds of coins all over departures. You would never think she’s some grand CEO in International Publishing, would you? Claire had some difficulty coming back. She wanted to drink the plane dry. We didn’t let her.; We landed at four pm on Sunday afternoon. They went to get the train and I went to find my car, as I was going to drop in on Tabby in Guildford. Oh, bummer: couldn’t remember where I’d left my car. It seemed years since I had dumped it in a car park at five thirty in the morning. I got on the Long Stay bus with many others. The bus driver would call out, ‘C – bus stop three’ and people would confidently alight. I was not confident. C did ring a bell, as did B and D. 19 struck a chord, but so did forty nine and eighty three. I alighted (or is it alit?) randomly and started trundling my case along the rows. I was still so buoyed up by my holiday that I did not sit on my case and cry. I felt quite positive if a bit stupid. After I’d done about five long rows and was starting to consider the ‘sit on case and cry’ option, a lady stepped out from between two cars and called ‘Hello, lost person!’; ‘Hello,’ I answered pathetically.; ‘We’ll help you find your car, in our car, if you like,’ she said.; Oh, the kindness. Luckily, ages ago, Barney attached some wooden slats to my car as an improvised roof-rack, so it’s not difficult to spot. We did about twenty rows with my head swivelling left right left right like I was watching the tennis, and found it. The kind couple told me the same thing had happened to them a few months back, and somebody had helped them. Swings and roundabouts, that’s what it is. And karma. Driving towards Guildford I remembered a hitchhiker we picked up on our way from Andover to Cambridge, about twenty years ago. We went out of our way to drop him off at his house in Guildford in exchange for a cuppa and a spliff. Maybe kind couple was the payback for that day, who knows?; I saw Tabby’s lovely little room which has a tree outside it. I met her ‘uni fwends’ aah bleeesss, gorgeous, all of them. We walked into town from the campus and ate at Jamie’s Italian. The linguine there is so ‘al dente’ it’s practically raw but the rich tomato and chilli sauce balances it fine. Drove home and found to my surprise that Alfie and Bashi had positively thrived under the care of Fred, and had done their washing for the week ahead. Had forgotten to go to the Japan Trip meeting though. Now Alfie will be the one who wears the wrong slippers into the loo or commits some other terrible faux pas.; The next day I saw Miss Benyon. Oh joy, I had her all to myself, apart from a registrar chap who accompanied her. ‘Gosh, you do look well!’ she said, ‘cos we were just saying, it’s only been two months. Has life started to take over again?’; ‘Yes, it really has,’ I said. I told her about swimming naked with the Beaut. She was pleased that her creation had already been on such exotic adventures.; She said she would do me a nipple in three months. If it wasn’t her doing it, I probably wouldn’t bother. But this way, I get to see her a few more times. She started going into various options. I couldn’t take in a word as I lose the ability to concentrate when she’s around. ‘Look, I trust you,’ I said. ‘You just choose the best one.’; My infatuation has not gone away. The Benyon effect seems to last for about five hours. I can still conjure up the peace and joy just thinking about her. Almost as good as a holiday.",0,1,0.0837994486767493
801,33,82,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Alfie came back from an all-night party the other day strutting about crowing ‘Bitches be trippin!’ It’s to do with girls swarming him and biting his chest. I am tempted to hijack this joyous phrase, as it perfectly depicts me and a couple of fwends mobbing the second-hand shops. What fun it is to steal the lingo off of the youf, thereby ruining it for them forever. When I ask Alfie to do something he says brightly ‘Yeah, but….’ he narrows his eyes regretfully, ‘CBA.’ This means Can’t Be Arsed, which he Can’t even Be Arsed to say. So when he asked for money to buy school shirts, I relished the narrowing of the eyes and the sweet timing of my own ‘Yeah, but…..CBA.’ Ha ha, it all comes back at you doncha know.; On Tuesday I drove to Cambridge myself. You can see why they tell you not to drive for quite a time though. It’s because, you don’t realise, but driving uses your back muscles quite drastically. So as your arm pulls the wheel round, the back muscle which is now part of The Beaut contracts and feels odd and tight across the front. Lisa the Breast Care Nurse told me that the muscle will give up after a bit. It’s still trying to do its job, poor thing. (Ooh, this last sentence illustrates rather well the difference between ‘it’s’ and ‘its’, doesn’t it?); The doctor (Miss Benyon was away) looked at me in wonder and asked if I was still drinking my Synergy drink. Impressed she had remembered, I said I was. She told me I can now shower all of me as opposed to half of me. Lordy, that’s a relief. I am also allowed to swim in the sea by the end of September. And now I don’t have to go back to the Plastic Surgery Unit for a whole month. Bitches be trippin!; Fred and I went to the ponies a few days ago. I can easily do their food now, brush them and even pick out their feet, but one thing I can’t do is pick up the car battery which powers the electric fence. I have not had the electricity on for a couple of months but anarchist Princey has increasingly been taking the piss, knocking down posts and wandering wherever he likes over the farm. The blokes building a big shed for Tom the Farmer’s Vietnamese tank (I know! we are surrounded by eccentrics) tell me that every day at one o’clock Prince casually busts through two fences to go up the top to scratch his arse on the tank. He has his own little routine.; So Fred moved the battery down the bottom and we connected it up. Unfortunately we forgot to tell Chloe, who did the ponies the next day.; She got her first shock as she tried to open the fence, but didn’t twig as she’s a bit of a duh. She then stepped over the fence one leg at a time and got a massive jolt to the nether regions. This has happened to me before and it’s better than sex, if a bit of a surprise, rather too quick and lacking foreplay. Later she pushed the metal barrow under the fence and got a huge bolt through her shoulders and down her arms. I have experienced this one too and it’s horrible. Your arms start smoking and your heart nearly gives out. She came home with a strange energy to her and did all her packing for Boston in one frantic go. It woke her up that’s for sure. Electrotherapy to be recommended for spaced-out youf.; Reminds me of a time when we kept the ponies on a farm in Manuden. We had taken several unsuspecting visiting children including Nay and Olive and Ruby and all of our lot with us. I went off on a trot round the block with a couple of them, leaving the others to pick up poos with Fred. We came back to a line of freaked kiddies all with their hair standing on end and their eyeballs popping out. Alfie had also walloped Bashi because he thought she’d kicked him. It transpired that Fred had been teaching them a Russian Roulette type of game where you take it in turns to touch the fence. When I asked him why he did this, he answered, ‘Because it’s what we played when we were young.’; Fred thinks he knows a lot but he does make quite drastic errors. One time we had a little flood in our cottage in Wimbish. He went into a small cupboard to turn off the water mains. The stopcock was in a hole under the floor of the cupboard. It was stiff so he squirted it liberally with WD40. He couldn’t really see where he was squirting as it was so dark down there. (Ooh sounds rude fnarr fnarr, as does the next bit!) He couldn’t find a torch anywhere so he lit a candle, put it in the hole and again squirted the stopcock enthusiastically. Boom. Out came Fred with smoking eyebrows and a black moustache. Ahhh, wot a larf we do ave.; The gin group is sadly in a state of crisis, perhaps even demise, due to differing opinions on rules of entry. Barney says it’s like the Bolsheviks and the Menshevics… he is so right. It is exactly like that. Wikipedia explains: ‘Martov, until then a close friend of Lenin, agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries, but argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers, revolutionary workers and other fellow travellers.’ My rampant, whorish sociability has led me to adopt this Martov type of stance. Bashi just sighs calmly whilst I am wringing my hands about all this, and says ‘Mum, every day at school it’s like that. I’ve been dealing with this sort of thing for years.’ She then quotes at me: ‘As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.’ She is a great comfort to me. How did she manage to be born so sane?; Dennis turned up yesterday with a bottle of Germanium water for me. He tells me that a scientist analysed the healing waters of Lourdes from the spring of Massabielle in France and found that the water contained Germanium Sesquioxide, a trace element which stimulates the immune system. Dennis bought it at great expense from Peter, the chap at the Cancer Help Centre who eats broccoli soup for breakfast. Having been given eighteen months to live (thirteen years ago!), Peter indulges in every anti-cancer thing going and strikes one as luminously well. He complains ruefully that, since he does not know which of his many expensive remedies is doing the trick, he has to keep all of them going.; Kind Dennis gave me more healing. I felt a bar of heat from his hands humming from temple to temple. He has done no healing for a month and was on top form. I felt warm waves throughout my body, saw purple shifting hazes and have felt deeply loving ever since, to friends, family, warring factions, all living things even frisky mice, Miss Benyon, the Earth and the Universe.",0,1,0.09423155719452016
802,33,83,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"The new boob feels great, but every time I sneeze I fear it might explode. I have heard reports of friends of friends who ‘did too much’ after their op: their scars opened up and wept; their implants popped out. So I have been careful to be lazy. We got Netflix so I have watched all of Fawlty Towers and plenty of crap movies. Every so often I shout or text someone for a cuppa tea. Sometimes I go in the kitchen and comment about the state of the floor or sink or dogs’ water. TTYTT (This is my own invention: To Tell You The Truth) *whisper* the kitchen has been a lot better than when I am looking after it, God knows how, as I swear I spent most of my old life cleaning it up.; I more recently moved up to my room as there is another jolly frisky mouse running around in the big room. I got freaked that if it ran up my leg the resultant screams could shoot the implant, back steak and fake nipple across the room to splatter the TV with gore.; So upstairs with no TV went back to blogs and found one called ‘Sweaters for Days and Moves like Jagger.’ The writer does marvellous recaps of 50 Shades of Grey chapters . Have also discovered Red Lemonade, an Irish blogger with posts on the theme of ‘Fifty Shades of Tedious Fuckery.’ They have been keeping me amused. Have had to clutch the Beaut firmly with both hands for fear again of detonations brought on by painful snorty paroxysms.; I am not allowed to drive, so other people have been driving me about. Chloe takes me to the ponies. I just pat them and sniff their lovely smell while she picks up poos, he he. Tell you what though, sooo annoying being driven to the shop by Fred. Firstly, he always bumps the car into Maura-next-door’s garage door. Then he reverses a bit and bumps into Maura’s house. I shriek, ‘Bloody Hell! You’ve crashed the fucking car twice and we’re not even out of the drive!’ He denies it every time. Chloe’s just the same. She not only mounts the kerb regularly (ooh sounds rude I know) but scrapes the car against the gate every time we come home, then denies it! Like father like daughter. There’s blates blue paint on the gate, mate.; Worse, in the shop. Fred does not take a trolley, just a basket. As if I can fit everything I need/fancy in a blinking basket! Then he rushes me past whole aisles. Today he marched me straight past the whole fruit and veg section! Bloody Hell. What will the parrots do without their lychees? I notice he does not miss out the wine aisle. Anyway, it’s all false economy, proved by the fact that since there was nothing to eat in the house except wine we had to get a takeaway from Chutney Joe. The parrots quite like the garlic nan, luckily.; Claire went away for the week. This was sad. I missed her. She is the only one to understand about Miss Benyon. Someone has written ‘I heart Miss Benyon’ all over my diary. Tabby…! your writing is recognisable you know.; Went to the Breast Unit for a reccy. Mr Farouhi was away. (Thank God these peeps get holidays from scooping out breasts.) We saw Prof Benson instead. Chloe giggled because he reminded her of David Walliams. He asked who did my dressing. I said I did it. He said ‘You can have a nurse to come and do it properly you know.’ I did not tell him about our local nurse who insisted there was ‘absolutely nothing’ in Tabby’s foot when later that day an inch-long shard of wood spewed out, and who accidentally jabbed Chloe twice with Typhoid. Prof Benson was pleased with my scar nonetheless. Gave me the news that only one out of eighteen lymph nodes was cancerous. This is an ‘excellent’ result. Am slightly mournful that seventeen healthy nodes had to bite the dust, but, hooray, I beasted it.; They let us go, then called us back in again. Uh oh. He’d forgotten about the lung nodules. ‘We’ll book a CT scan to check they are static, not growing,’ he said.; Then I talked to a Dr Wilson about the oncology side of things. He was jovial and awfully kind. He explained about Tamoxifen. Wikipedia says this about the drug: ‘Some breast cancer cells require estrogen to grow. Estrogen binds to and activates the estrogen receptor in these cells. Tamoxifen is metabolized into compounds that also bind to the estrogen receptor but do not activate it. Because of this competitive antagonism, tamoxifen acts like a key broken off in the lock that prevents any other key from being inserted, preventing estrogen from binding to its receptor. Hence breast cancer cell growth is blocked.’ I will probably take it for two years. One pill per day. Will switch to an aromatase inhibitor for the three years after that. They both stop the cancer coming back. I asked if it would make me depressed like wot the FEC did. He said, no, it’s not anywhere near as bad as FEC, but ‘you might have a little slump,’ he warned.; Dr Wilson talked about Herceptin too. It’s a monoclonal antibody that I will have intravenously every three weeks. It can give you flu-like symptoms but not for long. He offered me the Persephone trial where you are randomly assigned to six months or a year. I asked if six months was better in his opinion. He said he suspected it was, and that he was generally quite good at backing the right horse. I asked if one can choose just to have six months. He said yes, one can just walk away, but it is not advisable. I said yes to Persephone.; Since then I have been googling Tamoxifen and Herceptin like mad. It’s fascinating.; Then right after the bank holiday I went back to the Plastic Surgery Unit. Fred took me. Lindsey, who worked on stitching during the op, changed the small dressings which are still on The Beaut, underarm and back. She seems so young. We chatted about buying houses. A dissolvable stitch has popped out of the boob wound. She trimmed it. Then, OMG, I heard Miss Benyon’s voice outside the cubicle. The curtain was tossed aside, and she was there, dressed in her softly green operating garb. What an unexpected delight. Neither Fred nor I could say anything as we are so besotted. We just sat there like duhs.; ‘How are you doing?’; ‘Fine,’ I croaked.; ‘Really?’ She turned to Fred. ‘Is she really doing fine?’; ‘Nghh,’ said Fred. He has truly joined the Miss Benyon Appreciation Society.; ‘Well, you certainly look well!’ she enthused. She had maybe spotted that my hair is now one centimetre long in some places.; I just sighed with admiration and joy. She admired her handiwork. In answer to a burbled question she reckoned I could probably swim in the Greek sea in a month. She always finishes with ‘Any questions?’; We can never think of any. Oh, I did remember one. ‘Sometimes I bend forward and the implant kind of goes ker-plunk.’; She laughed her wicked laugh. ‘It will do that for a while, but it will soon settle.’; We drove home plastered with happy grins. When you have seen Miss Benyon you feel like you’ve had a hit on a mahoosive bong.",0,1,0.04561861011329097
803,33,84,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Some of my more demanding Bladdicts have requested the tale of how the whole cancer thing began. It’s true that the beginning is missing from the blog: I only started writing things down two weeks into the saga when everything was already spinning round. I do remember the start of everything in fine detail though, and you never know when a story might help others who are newly diagnosed, so here it is:; I was lying in bed reading Asterix or maybe Tintin, absentmindedly stroking my breast, as you do. I registered an irregularity. Not even a lump, more of a slight ridge. I felt it again and again. They are hard to feel. They kind of slip away from you. ‘Fred,’ I asked, ‘Is this a lump?’; He felt it and said, ‘Yes.’ He doesn’t pussyfoot around, Fred. No ‘Sorry’, or ‘Oh, dear’, or ‘Mmm, could be’.; That ‘Yes’ was the beginning of it all. It was a Friday in early March. I waited the weekend and went to the doctor first thing on the Monday morning. It was Doctor Hunukumbure. I said to her, ‘I am Tabitha Tingey’s mother. Diabetes, remember?’; She did remember.; ‘I have a breast lump and I would like to go to Addenbrooke’s please.’; She felt the lump and filled in the forms without any fuss.; Addenbrooke’s Breast Unit phoned a couple of days later and offered me an appointment that very Friday. Fred was away in India with work so I went alone. (Silly me, but I had no idea that needles and biopsies would feature at this very first appointment.) I started to feel really scared sitting in the waiting area. Apprehensive, embarrassed that I would have to take my top off, verging on terrified. Wanted to just run out of there screaming my fucking head off tbh. Chatted to another lady who confessed that she also was shitting bricks.; They show you into a room which has a panicky level of equipment in it. I took my top and bra off and put them on a chair. I lay down on the bed. They probed the breast with ultrasound, confirmed the existence of the lump, took images of it, and measured it. During this you crane your neck trying to ogle the screen but you can’t see a damn thing. They then put a needle of local anaesthetic into the boob, and really soon afterwards inserted a long needle, wiggled it about to make sure the end was in the lump, then shot a kind of gun which made the end of the needle bite into some of the tissue. They pulled the needle out. This is called a Biopsy. It feels revolting. They did the same again to a lymph node under my arm. This was all pretty scary, but they are trying to help you, long term, so obviously you try to be brave. (If you are mad enough not to have taken a friend, a kind nurse holds your hand when the gun goes off inside your breast.) They then put steri-strips over the wound and a dressing over the steri-strips.; During all this, your mind tussles with the realisation that needles and ‘discomfort’ could be playing a largish part in your life from then on. After it, you feel proud for being brave but also like you might start weeping and wailing at any moment. The only thing that comforted me was the thought that the gin club was absolutely going to love the drama of it all, darling.; Then I was called in to see Mr Farouhi. He said, rather quietly and sadly, that he thought my lump was cancerous. ‘I look at lumps all day long,’ he said. ‘So I know what cancerous looks like.’ He mentioned lumpectomies and mastectomies. The word mastectomy gave me chills. I was told to come back a week later for confirmation. ‘Bring someone with you,’ they advised.; Remember, this all happened within one week of having first found the lump. A lot to take in.; I drove home in a stew and entered a state of constant anguish. I spent the week researching online. Phoned friends who I knew had been through it. Didn’t want to tell Gwanny. Didn’t want her to be sad. ‘Should I tell Gwanny?’ I asked Bashi.; ‘Well….would you want me to tell you if I had cancer?’ offered Bash. She is clevs. I told Gwanny.; A week later, Fred was still away. Kind Claire came with me to the Results Clinic. We discussed it on the way. I said to her ‘Look, they told me not to spend the week hoping. So I haven’t. It’s obvious they think it’s cancer.’; So when they said it was, nothing moved inside me. I had already understood. I did space out though, so Claire wrote things down and asked questions on my behalf. One does go into a bit of shock. Mr Farouhi said the cancer was very probably caused by the radiation I had when young. He explained that with a lumpectomy one also needs radiation. He was therefore recommending a mastectomy as my only option because I had already had over the recommended life-time dose of radiation. The breast care nurse showed us line drawings of mastectomies and different types of reconstruction. She did say one reassuring thing. It was that all the possible surgeries are at least on the surface. It’s not as if you have to go deep into any body cavities.; Claire and I went for lunch at Brown’s. I did enjoy it, as pitta with mezedes and vino can always cheer me up, but found, of course, that I was heavily distracted.; That evening the gin club came round to commiserate. We wrung our hands together, googled pictures of mastectomies, checked out survival stats, and got pissed. Over the next few days, I contacted cousins, friends and friends of friends who have experienced breast cancer and I listened to their stories. I berated myself for not really having realised that they had a story until it became my story. Selfish bitch that I was. ‘It’s all about me!’ My feelings swung up and down and around and about like I was a loon.; Fred then came home from India: his arrival home is charted in the first blog post ‘My husband comes home.’; Thinking about it all now, six months later, I realise that it seems strange to say this, but I am glad that this happened to me. I have discovered a blogger, Florence, who writes about ‘the perks of having cancer.’ She has seriously managed to find zillions. I hope she won’t mind if I tell you my top seven ‘perks’:; 1. Miss Benyon sigh with admiration and joy.; 2. Dennis the Healer.; 3. The many kindnesses of wonderful family and friends near and far.; 4. Experiencing the joys of a brazilian with none of the pain.; 5. Discovering a whole social cyberwhirl through the blog.; 6. The fact my kids have finally learnt how to do the dishwasher, do the shopping, cook, tidy up, clean out the parrots, do the ponies, walk the dogs, pick up poos, sweep the floor, wash the clothes, de-flea the cats, clean out the car.; 7. The fact that the gin club is going global, which would not have happened without the cancer nor blog because our international profile would not have been sufficient. (OK, OK, cousin Kate in Paris just invited us to stay, but still….woohoo Europe here we come.)",0,1,0.1331334175084175
806,33,87,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"So, to pursue this mental tale: a bit later, Lisa, a breast care nurse that I know from the breast unit, brought me a heart-shaped pillow and a shoulder bag for the drains. She explained that my body will be trying to identify the implant which is under the steak from the back. It will try to put white blood cells in to kill it off as a foreign body but will soon realise it canʼt, so it might start trying to do the next best thing which would be to encase it in scar tissue. She was warning me that things like this can lead to the need for maintenance later. She also explained that the part of my back which was swung round has left two layers that are now stuck together as if with glue. She likened it to a ham sandwich having had the ham taken out of it and the two pieces of buttery bread being stuck together. She is brilliant at constructing helpful images.; Fredʼs cousin Suzanne dropped in. I was so touched. Also my friend from Debden days, also called Suzanne, came by as she had accompanied her son for an MRI. Thrilling and unexpected. You just have no clue whoʼs going to pop by for a quick reccy.; On Friday I received a text from Mad Lucy. It said: ʻThe gin club support squad are mobilised and ready for action. ETA, gin oʼclock.ʼ; They turned up, Lucy, Claire, Agent X and Mette, a rowdy rabble. ʻShushʻ I hissed, ʻweʼre in a bloody hospital. Youʼll get me evicted!ʼ Claireʼs cousin Becky from Manchester was with them. I had only ever met her on Facebook so we were delighted. She has done five chemos and has one left to go, but had her op before the chemo. She was recently hospitalised with an infection but is now against the odds looking fantastic with her blueygreen headscarf and translucent earrings. We both dumped our scarves because it was so hot.; The club had brought gin and ice and lemon and glasses. I had a burdock, dandelion and ginger drink instead. A nurse came in. ʻWeʼre having too much fun,ʼ I explained guiltily. (Sin is back. Poor Dennis will have to come again.) ʻIt is allowed,ʼ she smiled. ʻWeʼre ignoring the bellows of laughter coming out of this room.ʼ Thatʼs Agent Xʼs fault. Mad Lucy swears she can hear her laughing from the other end of their common street.; The club absolutely drooled over the new boob. They were as surprised as me that it looks so good. I told them all about Miss Benyon. Every time I say her name I give a little sigh of admiration and joy. Claire said I obviously fancy her and now that I have lesbian hair I could make advances. I said she would never have me as she has seen my fat, scars, baldness and probably lolling tongue. Claire said no, Miss Benyon could sculpt me into a perfect shape exactly as she wanted me. Ooh, we did ave a larf and a half.; Claire wants to write a blog solely about the exploits of the gin club but says she canʼt write for shit. I told her she should call it ʻThe Worst Blog in the World.ʼ She came up with ʻThe Worst Blogin the World. ʼ He he. It wonʼt be like my blog. No angels, only cynicism and despair. However, she did shave her head for me. Maybe only a true cynic would do that, having shed all clinging shreds of vanity. Hmm, a girl of contradictions. Will we ever truly know the darkness in her soul? Perhaps she is an angel but in a most sophisticated disguise.; Mad Lucy had brought me blackberry chocolate, kissing mints and balms. Mette brought me stacks of postcards from her art shop. Peeps will be receiving these soon – panic not,you have not been forgotten. Not sure how, but we ended up getting very merry and singing ʻI beliii-hiii-hiiieeeve in angels, something good in everything I see,ʼ before we remembered to shush. I managed to get rid of the bunch of loons.; At around nine at night a nurse came in and said she was very sorry but they badly needed my room for someone else. (More on this later!) Damn, I had a feeling the raucous party atmosphere of the gin club would cause my eviction. Claireʼs caterwauling might have been their clue that I am having an absolute ball and donʼt deserve my private suite. I had to move out there and then and lie on my bed in the corridor for two hours as punishment (only joking obv, they really were sorry) while they arranged for a space in a communal bay to be cleaned. I didnʼt mind. I eavesdropped on snippets of banter between nurses. Being on a ward is kind of noisy though. Snoring, groaning, comings and goings. Harder to sleep and the view is mostly blocked by a curtain. Never mind, I was spoilt for four days, canʼt complain.; So today I met Susan in the bed opposite. She was in a collision with a bus in her Smart Car seven weeks ago and was airlifted here, unconscious, from Kings Lynn. Canʼt remember a thing about it, not even where she was trying to get to. If she had gone to her local hospital she would have had her arm amputated, but here they saved it and gave her a skin graft from her thigh. She is shockingly lucky to be alive. She has not been home in seven weeks and misses her seventeen-month-old labradoodle, Ted. I suggested her husband bring the dog and take her down in a wheelchair to see him. Susan refused all vegetables and salad at lunch. I tried to make her have some but she wouldnʼt.; The pretty blond in the bed next to her has had surgery to remove excess skin stretched from previously being (her own words) ʻmorbidly obeseʼ. (BTdubs donʼt wuz she has said she doesnʼt mind if I put her in the blog.) She had a stomach bypass a while back which made her into ʻthe amazing shrinking mother.ʼ Sores from resultant flaps of skin forced her into the op. Her life is like Eastenders in more ways than ten. Jolly entertaining. Her beautiful daughters are called Shanelle and Chelsea (This last after the football club and the flower show, apparently). Her cat is called Tibby, but his full name is TubbyMctubmuffintub-burgerboy. Double-barreled poshness. It must be admitted that this extravagance rivals our Lucifer Archimedes Benjifluffles Fattipuss. This lady has become a bit of an instant addict on the morphine front, though, must be said, looking at her watch waiting for her next dose, but then her op was only on Thursday afternoon.; OMG have just been enlightened by Susan that the lady in this very spot before me was whisked off and given my room because some swabs had come back positive for something deeply infectious deserving instant isolation. FREAKOUT! Thatʼs why the cleaners were so strenuously wielding their disinfectant-laden mops at eleven at night. They even put up new curtains. At least Iʼve kept my own bed, table and cupboard and Iʼve been following the nursesʻ lead and washing my hands every five seconds. OMG do you think they wiped the light, the chair? Bloody Hell, donʼt come and visit me now, guys. Oh, TubbyMctubmuffintub-burgerboyʼs mum just told me she saw them wipe the light, and the chair. Panic over.; The kindest nurse of all, Josie, the one who gave me the foot bath, removed one back drain earlier today. It was the one that was itching a bit, so Iʼm chuffed. It felt revolting as it was tugged out from quite deep inside. Squeamish times, but one down, three to go.; Arulesh called from Harlow Hospital. Her son was rushed in two nights ago with a raging temperature. They were terrified he had contracted Dengue Fever in Sri Lanka. Arulesh has known people who died of this, so was panicked out of her mind as you can imagine. However, all seems to be well and fear is subsiding. Thank the angels.; Trouble does come at least in triplicate: Chloe has not been to visit as she has been in severe pain. She thought she had bruised her coccyx and asked Fred to drive her to the doctorʼs clinic. He refused as sheʼd been out on the piss living it up all night so he was blowed if he was going to bother as she wasnʼt even trying to get better. The next day she was in such agony that he relented. The Doc said the impact had caused an extremely painful internal infection. So she wasnʼt skiving, poor lass.; Fred texted me ʻHave just been squeezing puss out of Chloeʼs back.ʼ The mind boggles. I texted back ʻI think you will find that pus is spelt with one s.ʼ Now heʼs laughing wondering how you spell ʻpussyʼ as in ʻfilled with pus.ʼ It canʼt be pusy, nor pusey. Must be pussy. This has sparked a debate on the ward. Fred says ʻHa, you see, pussy and pussy are spelt the same.ʼ I say, ʻMaybe, but puss and pus are not.ʼ; The mind also strangles itself over who might be emptying the dishwasher at home, seeing as how Chloe was scheduled to be in charge of all that shiz. Iʼm just not going to think about it. Iʼm going to enjoy the fact I have lusciously entertaining new neighbours and the fact the NHS know how to make a mean cup of tea.; Ooh, Addenbrookeʼs Radio just came round. Theyʼre doing a request show from five today. Guess what I requested? No! Not I Believe in Angels, (although Iʼll phone in with that one too, as everyone here needs angels.) Seasons in the Sun of course. Because it doesnʼt do to forget neither our darkest anguish nor our childhood holidays. Will leave you now as Iʼm going to tune in.; Yay, they are playing it now!!! Now that the spring is in the air, little children everywhere….think of me and iʼll be there….the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time….the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone……boo hoo hoo, oh shit, Iʼm going to crash just like Miss Benyon (sigh of admiration and joy) predicted….with the flowers everywhere, I wish we could both be there…ooh wicked key change, ooh another one, orgasmic stuff….all our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun….; I rest my quill, for as Fred says, I could blog all day, but that is one way to get clots.",0,1,0.06218674668892694
808,33,89,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,Fred here. I am under instructions to say: Hester has come round. She is loving the drugs. She has a room with a view of poplar trees. She thanks everyone for their prayers and best wishes. (The booby looks great). It was a long day that simply flashed by. The NHS rock. Feel a million dollars.,0,1,0.3357142857142858
810,33,90,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"In the interests of ‘telling it as it is’, I must admit to a slight feeling of dread. Not panic at all. But definite dread. Only forty eight hours to go before heading off to the hospital. I have been feeling a bit like a condemned person heading off to the block or the gallows. This brilliant picture of Mary Queen of Scots at her execution says it all.; See how she holds her head high. And she looks straight ahead of her, ignoring that massive axe. I will be like this. Strong, resolute, wronged!; Haven’t even got the sports bras yet that they recommended I buy. Nor have I managed to throw away three quarters of my possessions like wot I wanted to. Have been typing and editing Dennis’ book though. And walking miles and miles while trying to hold on to my mind.; Over the last two weeks, up till now, my mental state remained reliably steady. I simply took the decision to trust the surgeons. To hand myself over to them. Mr Farouhi strikes one as calm, kind and clever. What more could you want from a surgeon? Miss Benyon is quick, clever and incisive. No problem there with decision-making, a huge asset in somebody who will be tunnelling in your armpit. You don’t want one of them faffers for sure. Just imagine one going ‘Ooh, should I cut off a bit of this rib? I’m so not sure. Mmm. Don’t know. Maybe, maybe not. And how far down should I slice this ol latissimus dorsi muscle? Six centimetres? Or eight? Ooh, can’t think! Tut, aren’t I naughty?’ Would make a wicked sketch. Get on it, Tabs! It really would also be preferable to have a surgeon with elevated thoughts, one well acquainted with Shakespeare. You don’t need someone poking around inside you going: ‘Yeah, the new Batman movie is well sick, innit? The baddie is like sick, and Batman is like even more sick. And it’s like three hours long.’ So I don’t think Alfie should be a surgeon. He’d probably sew you up with bits of popcorn left inside from throwing them in the air and failing to catch them in his mouth. It’s what he does with blueberries. They end up all over the kitchen floor. (Don’t tell Gwanny.) They’re expensive too. Drives me mad.; I have been in philosophical bent, questing, trawling the depths of my being. Calling upon any lost or hidden reserves. Have also been enjoying every minute being free of chemo. Loved the three-day beer festival at the Legion with the locals, rode a horse called Twister to a country pub, nay, even attended the Olympic dressage with Claire, cheered on Zara no less. Gosh though, isn’t it odd on that train from Stratford to Greenwich when you peer between the shiny buildings and spot enormous olde worlde SHIPS? Fascinating. It’s like: skyscraper….enormous shiny tower block….GREAT HULK OF A SHIP….mirrored edifice….MASSIVE SAILS AND MASTS….blinding bling construction….LOOMING GALLEON. Unreal.; Life is busy again. Four children returned to wreak their havoc upon Bishops Stortford. Tabs has shot off again to Edinburgh. Fred has set up his company, Tingeytime Ltd. He’s working flat out. I am secretary of the company. Lucky I can type. Don’t tell Fred but I am teaching the parrots to say ‘Tingeytime YEAH!’ We are also revising ‘Get a jooooob Fred,’ for when the money runs out.; I have to be at the hospital at 7am on Tuesday. Must not eat anything from midnight. I went for pre-op tests, blood-pressure, bloods, ECG etc. It wasn’t too scary. Just one nurse chatting to me in a tiny cubicle. She did mention the ‘discomfort’ quite a lot though. The phrase she used was ‘yes, you will probably be in quite a lot of discomfort.’ I wouldn’t have taken this too seriously except for the sad look in her eyes. She has accompanied many women through their ‘discomfort’. She also said that I would wake up with a catheter. Hate that. They are so uncomfortable. And I don’t like them fiddling around with me while I’ve been out. However, needs must. Worse to be desperate to go for a wee and not be able to get up.; The plastic surgeon sent me for photos. You have to stand there with your tits out. You feel very exposed and very much like you have done something wrong. Then I went for a cardiogram. It was not an ultrasound one like last time. No probing. Just someone sticking very sticky plasters attached to wires all over you. They tell you to relax, and get some graph print-outs of what your heart is doing.; So, back to the mental preparation. Firstly I have been reading poems, which take you to different levels of your mind, far away or deep inside you. I have been reading the anthology Being Alive. I actively appreciate the craft and share the fun the writers have had putting the words together. The thing is, the choice is so vast. Any word can come next so a writer has to possess serious sifting skills, decision-making powers. How do you choose which one? Even with my inferior casual bloggy prose, this still applies. I could choose my next word to be Bollock or plank or blunt. But they would jar. They would not further the narrative. Oh Bollock.; Secondly, I have been drinking Pure Synergy. This is a powdered green drink. It looks like it’s been dredged from the stinky underbelly of a London canal. You knock it back. It has sixty four ingredients. It makes you feel like all that Olympic swinging about on the parallel bars would be a piece of piss. Weight-lifting? Tchuh! I could hoick that thing onto my chest and heave it aloft no sweat. I could chuck that javelin miles. I could run and swim like a loon. I highly recommend this drink. It’s seventy three quid, but the jar lasts six months.; Thirdly, I have been going to yoga. It expands your mind right into the tips of your limbs. When you are in the poses, you feel relief. Relief from the whole of life. I have been doing Salutation to the Sun. It is a sequence of moves which you do with steady breaths out and in as your body opens and closes. Your lungs start to feel like powerful bellows. It has the added benefit of toning up your abdominal area fast. I want to tone it up, even at this late stage, as I don’t want the operating team to be going ‘worra fat cow!’ while I’m not in a fit state to formulate a smart riposte. Sincerely sorry to bore you with this pathetic insecurity, but I am telling it as it is, and maybe this is how a lot of people feel about their bodies.; My friend Tracy B popped round to wish me luck. She is out the other side, having had reconstructive surgery on the second of June. She showed me her very neat new boob. This has really helped. I must remember to do it for someone else before their op, assuming I get a neat one of course, and not a botched job. We were talking about friends who have had double mastectomies. I said that in the end my surgeon was recommending a single. This means there is still the possibility of having to go through all this again with the other boob. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘you’ve been through it once. You would go through it again, it wouldn’t be a problem.’ You know, she’s right. We are capable of so much. And I’d probably make a whole lot less fuss the second time round. Take it in my stride. None of this blogging Bollock.; Reminds me of when Alfie first joined the College, age 8. I went to a rugby match (he was in the Gs at that point, poor lad!) and then to the Match Tea. There was a tiny geezer sitting pale and trembling with his cracked arm on a pillow. ‘Gosh, what’s happened to him?’ I asked.; ‘We put up a jolly good fight, that’s what’s happened to him!’ enthused a mother, briskly. ‘Can’t let St Faith’s get away with it, you know. Got to lock horns!’; So I am going to be like a College Rugby Mum. Brisk, no nonsense, all that. Watching the Olympics has been an education in this. Those athletes have had to fight through pain and face defeat regularly. (My normal self does ask for what though? You could understand it if the aim was to escape a woolly mammoth. I’m not sure I get the competitive thing about simply wanting to be the fastest. But a lot of people seem to think it’s very important. So I will call up images of Jess and Farah when the going gets tough.); I suddenly wanted to send postcards to all the people who have sent cards to me. This was an urge beyond my control. The Stiven Family Postcards work in mysterious ways. And I don’t want to leave things outstanding in case I never come round from the op. Unlikely, I know, but possible. Gwanny came round with her bottomless tub of cards. We had fun choosing the most apt ones for Lissi, Hilly, Hilda, Jeanie, Sue, Meg and Ali, Bobby and Marlene, Fiona, Roo, Phoebe Meg, Georgina, the list goes on.; This one is for Annika, because the statue was found in Thessaly, and we spent our year in Thessaloniki together:; It is how I imagine myself waking up after the op if things have gone a bit wrong, to say the least.; I found a brilliant Freda Kahlo which reminds me so much of how the FEC made me feel. Needles everywhere, a ripped and exposed body, a broken column up the centre, tears jetting out and arid wastes behind. Essentially pretty fucked up. Thank the angels that’s over. I didn’t send it to anyone for fear of making them fall into a depression.; I’ve been reading a book called The Four Agreements. They are basically, oh God, I always forget what they are, dammit! The first one is …..shit, I’ve bloody forgotten. Oh yes, it’s Impeccability of the Word. It means, don’t lie, say is as it is. The second is Don’t Take it Personally. Very useful and you know, it is often about the other person’s crap, not about you. The third is, oh God, I’m going to forget again. Think. Oh, yes, it’s Don’t Make Assumptions. So important. I always assume other people are going to see the dogs’ water is getting low and refill it. But they never do. The fourth is Do Your Best. Even at little things like stroking the cat. If you follow all these you will apparently experience heaven on earth. I’m trying.; Comfort can be sought in so many things. Last night I had cider. Ooh, can’t say cider without a distinct West-Country accent creeping in. It’s well refreshing, though. Organic, Waitrose. Mmm. Today I had Old Jamaica chocolate. Didn’t know it still existed but found it on the Dairy Milk shelf.; I am gathering things to take into hospital: Rescue Remedy, Arnica, Hypericum, roll-on Energy Remedy, Burt’s Bees balm, Mike’s warrior, my Synergy drink, pyjamas and the soon-to-be-bought bras.; So please think of me on Tuesday morning. Fred is going to visit straight away on Tuesday afternoon to hold my hand while I’m moaning and groaning. He won’t mind or notice, as he’ll probably be reading his book, which is what he did whenever I was in labour, even when the heads were popping out, but truth is, he’s still the person I would most like to be there. Dennis is going to visit at some point, can’t wait. And so are the gin group! Same time as our usual meeting, five thirty on the Friday. They will bring gin apart from Mad Lucy who will bring vodka in her hip flask. I won’t have any gin *wink*. I’ll be on the hard drugs. (I have handily suspended my anti-drug fanaticism, due to anticipation of ‘the discomfort’, until one month hence.) Then I should be out, all being well, on the Saturday.; Chloe will do a quick blog to tell all bladdicts that I have come round ok.; Have been receiving unprecedented numbers of hugs from kindly friends. And of course, being me, I laugh any seriousness off, and sidestep it all with silly jokes, but they have been insistent. They hold my arm, look me in the eye and say, ‘No, really, I hope it goes well. I will be thinking of you.’; This helps so much, I can’t tell you. I am buoyed up with love. Tracy says she felt ‘carried’ by her friends. I feel that too, like the burden is being shared. I’m also thinking the surgeons probably have angels with them. If not, I’m hoping an angel will choose to go in with me. Maybe Ferg, or Anjani, or Mike. So, I’m really not nervous, just EXCITED. Bring it on!",0,1,0.03818810125060124
811,33,91,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Alfie and five of his mates, Alex, Andy, Brandon, Jack and Teddy have had their heads shaved. They look fantastic! (No, in truth, they look quite odd and much older!) Incredibly, they have raised almost four grand for Cancer Research. If you want to look at their Just Giving page, it is http://www.justgiving.com/LADS2K12 . Please don’t feel obliged to give anything; it’s not like they’ve run a marathon! However , as Tabby eloquently explains on her Facebook ‘If you know them, you will know how important this is, as they absolutely bum their hair.’ Here is a picture of me with Alex, Teddy, Jack and Alfie:; When they got to France, they went one step further and shaved their heads with shaving foam and razors. Alfie unfortunately cut into Alex’s head, not having had much experience of razors.; You can see the plasters on Alex’s head.; Fred accompanied me to see the Plastic People. We discussed his new project on the way. Exciting stuff based on a big idea, but I can’t tell you what it is because it’s a secret and if I tell you I will have to kill you. He’s setting up a company and getting cool peeps on board, so funsville!; We waited in a tiny room. I put on the small gown thing.; ‘We should write down some stuff while we wait,’ I suggested.; ‘Good idea. So, what have you learnt so far?’ asked Fred.; ‘Well, obv they can’t do the tummy op because of the damaged blood vessels…’ I began.; ‘No, no, not about all that,’ said Fred dismissively. ‘About my project.’; Er no. It was time to focus on boobs. I made him write down all the questions that have been surfacing recently. He then went off on a long meandering journey to find the loo. Typical. Just as he had left, Miss Benyon and a nurse came in. Miss Benyon is animated and direct. She impaled me with her eye, and claimed ‘I have read all your notes.’; ‘Good,’ I replied.; ‘The lymphoma you had when you were sixteen was wrapped around the mammary artery, and they actually removed part of the blood vessel that I would want to use if we were doing the tummy op. So, it’s a definite no now to that option.’; ‘Fine. I had already accepted that.’; ‘It is possible that the high levels of radiation you received will also have damaged the blood vessel in the back that I want to use, but we will only know when we go in.’; I have chosen reconstruction using tissue from the back. I like that all the skin of the boob is left. Only the stuffing will change. I have watched the op on youtube. The flesh is just shunted round under the skin. Even the small circular piece of skin from the back pops through to become the new nipple. All still attached to its own blood supply. A bit confusing for your body, and for the Angels trying to help, I would think, but really very clever.; After all this exciting gory stuff, Fred came back. Miss Benyon answered our questions. ‘You must do nothing for five weeks. She must do really nothing,’ she insisted, giving Fred a bit of a menacing look. Hehe, I like it. Maybe him popping off to the loo at the wrong time has given her the clue that it’s probable my newly carved-up self will be abandoned with multiple crises brewing requiring heaving, lifting and shunting. Insightful woman.; ‘Can we have a date?’ we asked.; ‘I don’t do dates,’ she said. ‘One of my people will ring you. Don’t worry.’; One of her people did ring me. I have a date! Tuesday the 7th August. Hooray. I need to be able to make plans.; Then on Thursday I went for a final oncology appointment. Waited two hours. Watched patient people being called in for bloods and appointments. Met a nice couple. She was very cheery and he was called Henry. He looked wiry and bright-eyed despite being on his third bout of cancer. He’s had the top half of his stomach removed, so he doesn’t feel hunger and has to remember to eat. Sometimes he can only drink Jersey milk which he claims kept him alive after ops. Having said all that, he’s doing marvellously well. ‘Living with mets isn’t that bad,’ he told me, ‘I’ve done it for twelve years.’; After Henry had been seen they both came back to find me in the waiting area. His wife clutched my hand and said ‘Good luck. I just know you’ll be fine.’ Sprightly Henry shook my hand. ‘Yes, really, best of luck’, he said. This made me feel happy and helped me wait patiently.; Finally I was called in to see a chap called Hugh Davies. He obviously had no clue who I was or what I had but did apologise for the wait. ‘You’ve been seeing Nandos have you?’ he asked. ‘Nandos is away.’; Haha, now I know his nickname. I am glad he’s escaped. He’s probably swimming in Greek seas. I told Hugh my whole sorry tale. He was useful for one thing. He said ‘Really, don’t worry about the lung nodules. Half of my patients have nodules. Your lungs’ surface area is that of a tennis court. Two 7mm nodules on a tennis court? Pfff. See what I mean.’; This lifted me a bit. Since then I have had twinges of excitement like wot I used to have. My life used to twang from twinge to twinge. You only realise they’ve been missing once they’re back.; The recent twinges are because my friends Beth and Bruno taught me how to make sushi. I just love rolling it, squishing it and eating it. Then we have Fred’s wicked idea and new company, and the fact that my children are scattered around Europe: Chloe is on Gavdhos, Tabby is in Lefkada, Alfie is in the Pyrennees and Bashi is near Perugia! I am chuffed that they are all off exploring the world. Another thrill is because Cousin Kate in Paris has invited the Gin Club to visit. Now that will be something to look forward to – the start of the Gin Club’s Grand Global Adventure. Kate says she doesn’t mind that Anonymous and Mad are bonkers, as she will be out at work! They do create trouble after dark, I should warn her.; I did not make it to the Cancer Centre this week, and anyway I don’t want to be greedy and use up all the healing slots, but I had a phone call from Dennis who said he would come round on Saturday morning. ‘But Dennis, it’s so far for you to come,’ I protested.; ‘I like your company,’ he assured me.; Dennis came, and healed. He put me into a deeply relaxed state where breathing slowed right down and the barking of the dogs and whistling of the parrots seemed to echo from another world.; I did the ponies, walked the dogs, then fell into a deep sleep all afternoon where again breathing was long and slow and deep. Then we met up with Janet and David at a Mexican place in Notting Hill. Enchiladas, Tostadas, Passionfruit Margaritas, and a very strange dish with hot charred peppers stuffed with queso on some black refried beans. Later, in the pub, I proudly showed off my new fuzz. Unfortunately Janet and Fred had quaffed large quantities of red by then and too truthfully pointed out that a) my new hair is grey, and b) it has really not grown very much since last time I showed them. OK, OK, you have deflated me quite enough thank you. I pointed out defiantly that my new hair is jolly thick. And soft. (And my friend Sarah said I was Sinead O’Connorish the other day.); Had the oddest feeling on the tube and train, that the chemo really has sterilised me, got rid of all my colonies of bacteria, cleaned me up. I looked at all those people with wild thick hair, stubbly underarms and God forbid, nostril thatch, and perceived them anew as untamed breeding grounds for thriving germ armies. I toyed with standing up to declaim, ‘You all need chemo! You should be cleaned! Strip that nasty hair away!’; How strange. Maybe I have that syndrome where you fall in love with your kidnapper. I was a Happy to be Hairy. Now I am a Born-again Smoothskin. I sense a good plot for a book rising. Just like in Day of the Triffids where only the blind or temporarily blind people survive, howsabout a big plague comes and kills everyone who’s not on chemo? Oh, Cancer is already halfway to doing that, thinking about it. You’d end up with a new race of humble, philosophical, depressed baldie-peeps.; I have woken up with the desire to throw things away again. Need Arulesh with her strict whisk-limiting capacities for that but she has scarpered. Will put it off til she returns. Wozzie and Claire are arriving from Ireland today. They love walking so we will escort them along our favourite well-trodden paths and then eat sushi. We have sushi rice, seaweed, avocado, green beans, mushrooms, cucumber and ginger, all ready.

812,33,92,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"OK! Stuff! Yeah! Bring it on!; Firstly, must tell you about the gin club outing. Took my vom bucket, just in case. I went in one door of the junk shop and Penel went in the other. By the time we met up we were both dragging beautiful old wooden chairs from the same set! Telepathy! We rummaged in three charity shops, with phenomenal success. It’s all White Stuff and Fatface in Saffy Walden. Penel found a beautiful patterned skirt but insulted almost everyone around her by exclaiming ‘Yes, but it’s so ENGLISH! UGH! I COULDN’T. SOOO ENGLISH!’ As if by living in France you become French or something. She bought it anyway. My mates are very persuasive.; We ended up in the King’s Arms having gin no less. Apart from Penel who had bitter because she misses good beer, poor thing, having to live in France. Then we drove home singing all the way. We chose the songs we would like at our funerals. Claire chose ‘Here Comes the Sun’, I like ‘There were Bells’ which was so good at Colin’s funeral, and ‘Seasons in the Sun’ of course, and Penel wants the French version of that. Mad Lucy would like ‘Star Man waiting in the stars’ and Agent-X-who-must-not-be-named because of her internet phobia wanted ‘Blackbird Singing in the Dead Elm Nigh’ and some mad tune none of us had heard of. We sang it anyway and went down Baroosh for cocktails seeing as how we were in the mood. We invited the men to come too. They had enormous fruity beer things and worked out how many clinks if everyone clinks. I had a mojito and then a rather healthy elderflower cocktail. We celebrated the chemo being OVER, FINISHED, GONE, DONE and the new hair being IN, BACK, THERE, BLACK. Hooray, hooray, yippedee doo dah.; Reminds me of a story Gwanny tells about her junior school lacrosse team cheering a gruff ‘HUP HUP HOOOOREEEE, HUP HUP HOOOOREEEE!’ and being taken aback by the other posher team chirping a ‘Pip pip Purrah! Pip pip Purrah! Pip pip Purrah!’; Four days after chemo I went for healing. Not a moment too soon as random retching was taking its toll. I think Dennis could see I was battered as he said he would come round on the Friday. He had spoken with Agent X too and had said he would heal her at my house. So, double healing. Absolute luxury. Thank you Dennis. Again as he left my feet to come up to my shoulder I could feel my feet still being held. Very odd. Also as he worked his way down my left side I felt the most wonderful sensation, like waves stroking my body, like I was being washed. It’s just exquisite. The relief! Afterwards we were sitting on the sofa talking and Dennis exclaimed suddenly at a bright flash of light in the room.; It’s the angels. You know, Dennis is seventy nine. You would never know. He looks about sixty. He says there is a man, a presence, in our big room. We always did think our house was haunted.; Since then I have felt better, certainly physically. However it don’t take much to upset the apple cart. (loving my metaphors today!) You know how you run into someone who is a bit abrupt maybe, and you suddenly understand exactly what ‘Bull in a China Shop’ means? Well, that happened to me this week. I told Gwanny about it on the phone.; ‘It’s like the bull in the china shop, Mum, and I’m the china shop.’; ‘Och, Grampa! She says she’s a china shop!’; I heard Grampa in the background saying ‘Och, noo! Oh, dear!’; ‘Tell him about the bull, Mum, otherwise it will make no sense.’; ‘Och, Grampa, there’s a bull, a bull, in the China Shop.’; I had to talk to Grampa myself to convey the metaphor properly. I’ve been jangled bad, that’s what it is. My aunt Lindesay laughed and said that she has always felt like a China Shop without even having any chemo. It must be nerve-wracking to be so sensitive. Normally I am a QuickFit Tyre Shop where a frolicking bull would be a welcome distraction.; I have been alone. My whole family are in Greece. So, just me and the animals. Time to stare into the mirror and contemplate baldness, ageing and being human. A chance really to take on board what has been happening to me. And to learn that if you order an indian takeaway for just one person, you don’t order the sag aloo, the tandoori king prawn, the bhindi bhaji, the biryani, the vegetable curry and the nan bread. Barney had to come round and help me eat it. But now he’s gone off to Greece too.; A few days ago, after an episode of dark contemplation, I found myself putting on false cheeriness for the animals. I didn’t want them to know I was sad, though if I do cry they all pile on top of me, it’s wonderful. If I go out, I return to find Huggi’s bed full of my jumpers and coats and my bag. Luckily for my mental state, every day I have had to go round Claire’s to have her inject me. She is quite good at this. Tabby trained her. She flicks the needle and everything. Doesn’t mind if I scream. In fact, Mattie reminds me to scream. And then they give me talk therapy, beer and romcoms to take home.; Yesterday I finally got to see the Plastic People. I waited for an hour and a half past my appointment time. They were most apologetic. Miss Benyan looks extremely clever. It took her one minute to explain that she would not recommend using flesh from the tummy for reconstruction, because the radiation I had to the chest area when I was sixteen will definitely have left damaged blood vessels there and for that particular op you need perfectly functioning blood vessels. ‘If you were my sister,’ she said, ‘I wouldn’t recommend it. It’s too risky.’; ‘Oh.’ I said. Pause. ‘Gosh, it would have been really helpful to have known that four months ago.’; Four months during which options (which it turns out never were options) sloshed their pollution around my head. Cruelty to middle-aged women, that’s what it is.; ‘How far through chemo are you?’ she asked.; ‘I’ve finished chemo,’ I replied.; ‘When did you finish?’; ‘Ten days ago.’; ‘Oh. Normally they send people to see us halfway through chemo, so we can book the op.’; Hmmm. I had a feeling someone somewhere had messed up. I did keep asking if I could see the plastic people. I did feel that time was ticking by. Here’s the rub: if the next available slot for my op is a long way off, they could ask me to have another chemo to keep the cancer at bay.; So: will I just nod cheerily and say ‘Oh, another chemo? Why not indeed? Feeling sick for nine days? I don’t mind. Anti-sickness which gives me depression? Not a problem. Going round Claire’s nine days running to be stabbed? Loving it. And I do so miss seeing my chemo fwends.’; Or will I lie down on the floor on my back, kick my legs and thcream and thcream and thcream until I am thick like the girl in Just William? And then pop my red face up to inform them that my blog is read in seventy five countries and do they want their reputation damaged and spread around the world?; ‘You could choose the Latissimus Dorsi option where we use flesh from your back,’ Miss Benyan continued. ‘In which case we use a blood vessel from the back and tunnel it through under the armpit so you would have a natural blood supply.’; Oh, God, oh God, oh God. QuickFit has gone and China Shop is back.; Should I just do a Carmel and have the boob lopped off with a jolly old straight scar and no stupid fake bulge? I don’t know anymore. I like my back. I don’t want people carving into it. But then would I get upset at dinner parties if Fred ogled cleavage? He is a man after all. I probably would. I would suffer dreadful boob envy. I could just decide never to go to another dinner party. Overrated things anyway.; ‘I don’t have much fat on my back,’ I protested.; Miss Benyan swivelled me round and made me look at my back in the mirror. ‘You do. Look at this layer of flesh.’; OK. So I have a fat back. Bovvered? Like, literally, bovvered?; I spoke to a nurse before leaving. She showed me pictures of the op. I said ‘Can you give me a date?’; ‘Next week we will have you in again so you have time to think of questions. Then we will give you a date,’ she said.; For the first time I am wondering how it would all have been if I had chosen to go to the Epping Breast Unit.; I wished I had taken Claire with me. She would have got a date for me. She would have decided it was time to set up the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Middle Aged Fat-Backed Women.; Since then I have been for dinner at Claire’s, Sue’s, Agent X’s, I’ve been on a fab outing to see Singing in the Rain with Cath, Ali, Lizzie, Gill and Lizzie’s Mum, I’ve had coffee in the Rosey Lea with Phoebe, I’ve been walking with Margaret. Despite all these blessings, I still feel freaked and wish I was swimming in the sea with my children. Claire just texted to ask ‘Are you feeding your good wolf?’; I replied ‘Good wolf died unfortunately. Only bad wolves.’ It’s really not that bad but I like to scare her and keep her on her toes.; She texted again: ‘I prescribe a dose of gin and friendship.’ We’re on for tonight. I’m thanking the Angels for friends.",0,1,0.10957731624100965
813,33,93,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Visited the Breast Unit on Monday. They were trying to give me a date for the op, but didn’t know when which plastic people were going on holiday. They think sometime during the first two weeks of August. They assured me that they only have experienced doctors in their department, even in August. Mr Farouhi, the surgeon, is very softly spoken. He was glad that chemo was going well. When I mentioned my Healer he didn’t say anything, just shook my hand and left.; Saw Ferdinandos on Thursday. He asked how the chemo was going. ‘Well, I had no symptoms at all with the last lot, but then I had been to a Spiritual Healer,’ I said. I do like to tease them.; He did not answer. He let it go. Obviously they both think it’s best not to encourage one.; Had my last chemo yesterday. My sister came with me. The woman next to me, Linda, had a great head scarf. It had words in varying sizes all over it: Bravery, Courage, Strength. I told her it was a great scarf. She said ‘Well, it’s good that it says what I’ve got.’ She was having Docetaxyl and Herceptin. She has to phone the pharmacy when she is on her way, as the Herceptin is so expensive (like £700 a pop) that they don’t want to be making it up if it’s to be wasted due to people not turning up. I told her about the Cancer Centre.; We had to wait for an hour and a half for the drugs to arrive from the pharmacy. The nurses were really on the ball this time. They slowed down the drip several times as my wrist and arm got painfully cold. They always say ‘It’s a darn shame we don’t have heat pads for your wrist but the microwave doesn’t work.’; I have been six times at three weekly intervals. You would think that somebody would have gone and bought a new microwave by now. Maybe it is not detailed in anybody’s job description. I should have twigged earlier and taken those heat pads that you crack to get heat.; By the time four hours were up I had had enough. Cried with relief on my way out. Had to hold my sister’s hand. She drove me home and made soup. We went to gin. Will never never miss gin, and last chemo is worth celebrating. (Only had one little gin promise.); Threw up in the night. Had to get up and let Huggi out three times as Fred refused. (Huggi gets a dodgy tummy if he manages to steal any food that is not his special dog food.); Husband’s level of cancer patient support has dwindled massively. It’s not like he has to get up for work in the morning. He did agree surprisingly willingly to go down to the cashpoint to put twenty quid on Chloe’s phone as she is in Greece and we want to be able to phone her. My sister said ‘Aah, you see, he does help out sometimes.’; I said, ‘Yes, it’s probably because on the way up the hill he will go into the pub to play Space Invaders for a couple of hours.’; She was saddened by my cynicism, but it turned out that I was right. It’s just as well Fred is going off to Greece again with Tabby, Alfie and Bashi. Maybe he will feel refreshed after that and won’t need the escapism of video games.; On my third midnight trip to the garden with the Dog and Vom Bucket (sounds like a dodgy fenland pub I once knew) I blew out the candles that Fred and Alfie had left flickering outside in the loggia. Honestly, they will burn the house down, the fools.; I washed off all the vom and cleaned my teeth. I got back into bed muttering darkly ‘I will put you in the blog. I will tell it as it is.’; I need to see Dennis. I only have to think of Dennis and I feel better. I only have to picture the Cancer Centre and I feel calmed. I have an appointment on Tuesday. Thank God and thank the angels.; Something else really really fabbily good: I have hair growing in! (on my head!) I have got FUZZ. Hot fuzz. Even Fred thinks this is Dennis’ doing. I showed everyone at gin. They exclaimed in delight. Also, it’s not even that grey. It’s pretty dark. Claire’s is really getting long now. She has even had it cut.; News Flash: We have our gin club outing today: junk shops and charity shops in Saffron Walden. He he, maybe I can aim to replace all the stuff my friends made me throw away. Life with only one whisk has been depressingly minimalist.",0,1,0.11273906153370437
815,33,95,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Chloe accompanied me to have Bloods at seven in the morning. She normally goes to bed about then so for the first two hours she was comatose. Still, better a sleeping companion than none. My neutrophils were fine, so chemo was scheduled for the first available slot. We waited in the Mary Wallace centre. I read a book about blood type diets and cancer. As a blood type O, I should eat zillions of broad beans apparently.; Sanjay was not available. I had a female chemo nurse. She did not introduce herself so I don’t know her name. She passed me four steroid pills.; ‘Last time I only had two of these,’ I said.; ‘They’re only 2mg,’ she replied. She did not go and check in response to my doubt.; It hurt when she put the needle in. She couldn’t get the needle into the vein and in trying, spiked a nerve. I leapt about 5 foot off the bed involuntarily.; She laughed. ‘Whoops! That’s the second person I’ve made jump today.’ She did not apologise.; Unfortunately, I tensed up badly. I need to have trust in my chemo nurse. Neither Chloe nor I felt that trust. Whereas last time Sanjay never took his eyes off the vein, this nurse never looked at it once. She chatted away mindlessly while the red epirubycin was going in. I attempted to chat but was cramped up with fear. I clutched my warrior in my right hand. When the fourth syringe went on, she disappeared. Another nurse had to help change over to the saline. The saline stopped and the first nurse was still nowhere to be seen. We waited and waited with the drip beeping annoyingly. We could see Sanjay, busy with other luckier patients, curling his lip with annoyance. He notices everything. Chloe went off to find our nurse. She was eating a chicken salad. She had not told us that she was going off for lunch, nor handed me over to anyone else.; We waited at the pharmacy for the steroids, anti-sickness, antibiotics and the syringes to boost neutrophils. Realised the nurse never told us how or when to inject these, so the pharmacy told us to go back to the Day Unit. Have to inject from day 7, in the thigh or tummy. In all, we were at the hospital from 8am till 3pm. Could think ‘Shit a day of my life.’ Could think, ‘Thank God I live in a place where I can receive the best treatment.’ Thought both.; I went to bed. Chloe did the ponies and dogs. Fred watched the football. I taught Ella. Dance of the Blessed Spirits, wicked tune. Went back to bed. Felt weird so I took the steroids, the new anti-sickness (taking the place of the Domperidone as it maybe had something to do with the depression) and the old anti-sickness. Too late! Fred brought me a bowl just in time.; Feel much better now I’ve thrown up. Got some Domperidone down me, as it really seems to be the only one that works. Don’t know what to do about the fact I’ve thrown up the steroids. Hard to know. Feel like I should ask permission before taking two more.; We had a look at the blog stats today. You will laugh at the list of countries participating in my boob lump story:",0,1,0.04221827913688379
816,33,96,24,3,2015,2015-03-24,"Went to have blood taken. No Ferdinandos today. A very clever-looking woman doctor called Dr Elizabeth Cox came in. She asked me how chemo was going. I told her about the frightening depression. She explained that FEC causes oestrogen levels to plummet and of course it’s oestrogen wot keeps you up, as we women know: PMT is caused by oestrogen levels falling before a period. A nurse popped her head round the door to pass my blood results in.; ‘Hmm,’ said the doctor, looking at them. ‘You are neutropenic.’; Ooh, sounded a bit rude. I felt like saying ‘I am not that! Are you disrespecting me? Are you calling me a pikey?’; To my affronted look she continued: ‘Some of the white blood cells which fight infection are called neutrophils. Your neutrophil count is very low. You don’t have enough of these for us to give you chemo tomorrow.’; I felt a mixture of relief and worry at the delay. ‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘It is quite common for the chemo to cause this. It might explain why you were feeling so low. Basically the FEC gave you a big knock.’; ‘Does that mean it also gave the cancer a big knock?’ I asked.; ‘Yes, absolutely, it does,’ she reassured me. ‘You can come back in on Monday morning. With any luck, by then the count will be higher and you can have chemo the same day.’; Hooray, the weekend I had written off is mine for the taking. She explained that cycle 6 (the last one!) will still happen as scheduled in three weeks time, all being well.; ‘Is there anything I can do, or eat, to help the neutrophil count improve?’ I asked.; ‘No,’ she replied. ‘There is nothing you can do.’; As you have already predicted I am sure, I didn’t believe this for a second. I will find ways to raise the count, ha ha, see, my fighting spirit is back!; ‘But when you have the next chemo, we will give you Neutrogen which will boost neutrophil production. You’ll have to inject it into your thigh each day for 6 days.’; Oh shizzle on my dizzle thank God I live with a diabetic. Tabby can inject me. Phew.; I thought I would get another perspective on the nodules. I asked where they were for starters. One is apparently in the lower left lung and the other in the mid right lung. Better to know thine enemy.; I asked if I should phone the Breast Unit people and talk to them about booking a slot for the op as one of my little worries has been that I’ll get to the end of chemo and they’ll say ‘Oh, sorry, the next available slot is in December.’ By which time the lump will have grown again and all this shrinkage effort will have been in vain.; ‘No, no,’ the doctor smiled. ‘We will do that for you. I’m booking you a meeting to work out a date and all the details.’; A nurse from Cancer Research UK came in as Dr Cox left. She asked if, when I have my op, they can have some of the removed breast tissue for research. They want to do two different studies looking at stem cells. I said of course they can use it. It’s not like I want to bury it in a box under a lavender bush, say a few words, have it cremated or anything. And the results of their research could help the doctors work out the best therapy for my cancer more accurately.; So, back home, with creation of white blood cells in mind, I have been making smoothies, using fruit that has a thick skin. When you are neutropenic you can’t fight invading germs so you don’t want to risk eating stuff that has earth or bacteria on it. So bananas, oranges, mangos and pawpaws are good. You want to avoid blue or unpasteurised cheeses and the like. I cooked some broccoli with lemon and black pepper, crispy kale in the oven, and Arulesh’s mum’s recipe of green beans with tomato and onion in garlic, chilli, fennel seeds, turmeric, cumin, curry powder and coconut milk. We baked butternut squash and stir-fried rice with scrambled Duchy eggs stirred in.; I have formulated a plan for next chemo. A simple strategy. Before Monday I am going to gather the sofas at the bottom of the big room and bring in lots of fire-wood. I’m going to make sure I have lots of lime and Volvic and ginger (and a bucket in case of the worst). I’m going to plug the phone in down there. (ooh fnarr fnarr sounds rude, but it’s not.) I’ll have a laptop, a pile of music and a flute. I’m going to get in some great films. We will light the fire, the dogs and cats will join me on the sofa under the blankie, pupils will pop in and play lovely tunes to me, and I will just stay there for a week and see what happens.; I am bearing in mind that the simplest strategies do not always work. My dad once decided to simplify Christmas. He found at a jaw-dropping bargain a rather handsome black umbrella and was so chuffed with it that he bought twenty five of them to give to neighbours and friends. He never suspected that they were a bad lot wot had fallen off the back of a lorry. He merrily handed them all out. Not til a week or so later did he venture out in the rain. At the first tiny gust of wind the umbrella flipped inside out and flashed its spokes lustily at the weather. ‘Never mind’ thought Dad, ‘this one’s probably a fluke. Chances are the others are all fine.’; Nope. We spotted the poor vicar struggling along Barton Road in lashing rain with what looked like a massive black flappy tulip. Mrs-Bliss-next-door’s umbrella’s spokes pinged clean off as she stepped out onto her front doorstep. One by one those umbrellas whoomped themselves inside out. We received dribs and drabs of news detailing that every single one of them had died a swift death on its first outing.; My brother Pete tells a funny story about one of Ferg’s failed plans. One day when we were away and had left the boys behind, Ferg, aged about seventeen, apparently came downstairs wearing one of Dad’s suits. Pete, a bit alarmed, asked ‘Why are you wearing a suit?’; Ferg said ‘I am going to the bank to borrow some money.’ (You kind of have to do the voice right: highly serious, heavily articulated, and formal, with a frown, if that helps.) He had decided that he needed to buy body-building equipment.; He came back an hour later with no money and no body-building equipment.; ‘What happened?’ asked Pete.; ‘It’s Saturday. The bank is not open,’ replied Ferg.; But anyway, my sofa/fire/film plan is a good plan. And I’m sticking to it. Means Fred will have to do the ponies. That’s OK, as he lost his job a week ago. (I know: it never rains but it pours.) Seriously though, if no job is forthcoming, we could sell up and live on a boat on the river Stort like Barney and Big Alf. We’d have to be tidy then.",0,1,0.04811179981634526
817,33,97,9,3,2015,2015-03-09,"Nellen posted a video on my wall about this woman who drank the juice of a whole cannabis plant every day and thus succeeded in ridding herself of terminal illnesses. You can watch compelling youtube vids showing that cannabinoids cause cancer cells to self-destruct.; It’s wonderful that this woman found her cure, and I am tempted to give it a go, but I can’t help but be wary of the mental effects. There came a point where I decided to steer clear of hallucinogens, partly because of my family history. I understand that mental health is to be protected. Thing is, once dodgy tracks are forged in your brain, they remain there, easy for thought processes to slip onto, grip onto.; My brother Ferg suffered from manic depression. He had episodes of it over ten years, from the age of 16 til 25. A horticultural course, psychiatric care and sheer determination helped him and he managed little by little with great effort to extricate himself from it. Aged 25 he had an unavoidable operation for a collapsed lung and fell into the most horrendous post-operative depression. He came home from Windsor in his Hillman Imp with all his things. As he passed the sign into Cambridge his windscreen cracked.; A few days later I was due to go off to Greece for a year to learn Greek. The night before the flight Fergus asked if I would come out to the pub, The Fort St George, to have a drink with his friend Andrew.; ‘Ferg!’ I exclaimed. ‘I’m leaving for Greece first thing tomorrow. I haven’t even packed yet. Of course I can’t go to the pub.’; This is the reason why, if you ever ask me to come to the pub with you, I am coming!; He came to the airport with my dad to see me off. I did realise that was odd but I was too self-obsessed to question it much. He wanted to say goodbye. He kissed me. Again, I should have known something was up. As I walked away from him, I was crying. Stupid, stupid. Should have questioned that! Not like me at all you see. Going to Greece was always a cause for elation and thrill, never sadness. My inner self with its infinite wisdom of course knew it was the last time I would see him.; Three days later he committed suicide.; It’s twenty five years later but we are still gutted. I flew home. I remember picking Great Granny up from the airport as she had been away, and the first thing she said was ‘We will never recover from this. Never.’; My mum had a stack of tenners in the drawer, and would take them out and shove them at us to buy food and drink. ‘Och, take the money, what’s money? It’s only paper,’ she said. We drank whisky. Friends piled in. We talked about Ferg solidly and cried and laughed crazily at stories people told about him. Luckily Mum’s friend Lissi brought us food, day after day. My dad went into his office, and the vine Fergus had grown for him from a seed had thirteen orange bells on it. It had never flowered before.; I regretted so many things. With a suicide everyone always feels like they could have prevented it. We yearned to turn back the clock. We learnt the real meaning and agony behind the word ‘Why?’ I learnt that grief is actual physical pain. I banged my head on the wall to stop it hurting. I had not really ‘got’ the whole love thing until then. I did not know that I loved my brother until it was too late to tell him or show him.; So, there was a life horribly shortened due to a chemical inbalance in the brain. This takes me back to my current point: we must be careful of our brains. Really, I mean, not take liberties, not play around with them. Nor take our stability for granted.; Apparently if it is juiced raw and not heated, the psychoactive stuff in the dope plant is not activated. I don’t know about that. I’m sure I had dope buns in Amsterdam once that made us think that avocados were so strange that they must be from outer space, and that water was THE ALIEN. Although that might have been those Welsh mushrooms we had on Granchester Meadows, thinking about it. We did go through phases of being pretty addled. Once we nearly went up to some unsuspecting passersby on the meadows to ask them what normal people do all day, as we had forgotten. Not the most helpful state to be in. Reminds me of the state of the old girls in the film Saving Grace. The scene in the shop, lol. Take a look.; Anyway, they probably won’t listen, and why should they, but my message to the youf is simply: don’t go there, or at least, not too often. Because the balance in our minds is precarious and oh so precious. It is really really handy to know where your body stops and where the rest of the universe starts. Being at one with the universe is overrated. And remember, just one piece of barbed wire and all its concentration camp connotations can start you off on a very nasty trip. Coiled ropes too are particularly bad due to their uncanny snake resemblance. And sticky chocolate toffees. Do not eat them while under the influence. In fact, tbh anything can set it off. And then you’ve lost it. It’s FML bigtime. No way back. Hours of hell. The fear that the real you will never return. The fear of sudden death and not having done half the things you wanted to do because you were too damn stoned.; It’s better to get to oneness with the universe through years and years of meditation, yoga and courage, not just be dumped there unceremoniously without a map. Or don’t bother with the years of meditation, just be content to stay close to the earth and accept that we are animals with basic needs for food, water, friendship, a bed, (ok, maybe a telly but deffo not a playstation): simple things. Be content with the prosaic but pretty creations of our own unstimulated minds or get on with the job of finding zinging but unchemical stimuli. Books are pretty good. The thing is, if you take drugs, then your normal mind becomes boring to you. You are tired of it. You crave that extra stimulation and energy. What you may not care about is that the extra energy is FAKE. And that you have to Pay It Back. It’s like getting a loan. Tempting, seductive and dodgy.; You may well ask, well, why did you take any drugs? Good question. Well, in our defence, it was the eighties. Whole houseloads of students I knew were doing big fat clay pipes full of pot first thing in the morning, so a few puffs in the evening didn’t seem too extreme. Also I think the bucket-loads of steroids when I was 16 had given me a taste for artificial energy. I longed to re-create in myself that bouncy effortless high where your synapses are firing away zip zip. It seemed to me that most young people of our generation were indulging. Smoky underground graffitied bars were alluring. It was as obvious as choosing Diagon Ally and Sirius over Privet Drive and Dudley. I felt a bit guilty about the health implications (having been cured of Lymphoma by the great effort of fantastically brainy surgeons) but didn’t see much harm in a few puffs, a few pints.; When you are out of your head, everything anyone says seems brilliant and hilarious. The more often you get out of your head though, the more the brilliant and hilarious things start to jar a bit, the more the laughing fits fizzle out on a contortion that almost hurts. Chirpy giggles turn to desperate spasms. You spend evenings talking friends down from bad trips. You start to realise you don’t enjoy it as much, and almost dread it.; Unfortunately, later in life, I saw the people who over-indulged either go mushy in the head, or really unexpectedly turn to religion, one translating the Bible into many languages in a monastery, another going from shagging three blokes a night to spending months in a mountain nunnery painting icons (true). One suddenly needed to deny his whole life and cut off all friends from his past, and some just became very square and scarily straight. Fred’s brother witnessed the more horrible side of the whole thing, with most if not all of his mates from his teenage years dying from drugs related suicide or overdose. So, you know, in the end you learn it’s not funny. It’s a big waste. Not worth the fun and games, the skinning up in fingerless gloves in the pale dawn light, the hilarity as people discover they have been smouldering the foot of their sleeping bag in the fire, the mindless giggling and meeting of minds. (*sigh* RIP good times?); No, not RIP. If you manage to abstain for a few weeks, you find that the giggling comes back, but it’s not quite so mindless. You have conversations and can remember bits of them, yay. You manage to go to plays, or films, or gigs. You experience more good times in the morning, and a few less in the middle of the night. OK, so I realise I am describing the process of getting older, yes, I know. Darn it, that’s what happened, we got old, shizzle on my dizzle, how did that happen?; But I’m telling you, the visuals today in healing with Dulcie were better than any trip. Her hands were cool; it was like peppermint in the brain. A lovely little mauve patch swam about beguilingly. Later I got a wide deep purple band. It was such a lush colour I wanted to get in it, bury myself in it. I even felt my mind detaching from my head: a black spikey mass pulling away top right from a bright orange area and then a feeling of such supreme comfort that my body was undetectable to me. It kind of dissolved. OMG, maybe I was at one with the universe. If so, I was wrong to say this feeling is overrated. It’s fab. But the healer gave it to me so calmly. A much less stressful experience than all that kerfuffle with rizlas, people hogging the joint, raindrops making your spliff go soggy and friends experiencing sudden scary blindness.; I forgot Dulcie was a medium and forgot to ask her if she could see any of my dead. Sometimes apparently she talks in the deep hoarse voice of her spirit guide. I would have found that fascinating, not scary. But Carole tells me the healers are not meant to do any of that strain of work at the centre.; Afterwards I felt so booming with vigour that I felt a bit guilty, that it was too self-indulgent. I told Dulcie this. ‘No,’ she said. ‘You do need this.’; ‘Other really ill people must need it more than me,’ I said.; She insisted again, ‘No, you should come again. You need it.’; The feeling that she maybe knows more about me than I do, from just one encounter, disturbed me for a second. But feeling rampantly flooded with fresh health dispelled this. I drove off singing Edelweiss with great deep breaths and raucousness out of the car window.; Ps. no photos as Fred has gone off to Greece with the camera, Bash, Alfie and their friends BB and Alex. Fred tried to take a photo of a frog up the mountain and slipped off a rock into the river. His phone drowned so I have no updates.",0,1,0.07273801490906756
818,33,98,2,1,2015,2015-01-02,"Well, so I was well and truly myself again. Hallelulia. Oh yeah, Gospel Mama, clap your hands and rejoice. (Gee, really hard word to spell, that Hallelulia. Am not convinced I have it right.) Back to my jolly old jokey-jokey self, ready for big lols. Or so I thought.; It so happened that I drove Tabby to Takeley for a drama lesson. For Takeley you have to get in the third from left lane at the big M11 roundabout. I accidentally got in one of the A120 Colchester lanes. I signalled right and tried to move over. Three cars honked at me. I swerved back into the Colchester lane. I was forced to go towards Stansted and round the roundabout and back. Normally, you understand, a) I wouldn’t get in the wrong lane at all, b) I would wave off the honkers with a ‘Oh get a life, y’ol codger,’ and have a laugh about how anal people are. But not now. The tears started to plop. ‘People just shouldn’t honk at people,’ I sobbed.; Tabby held my hand. ‘Horrible people,’ she said. ‘They shouldn’t honk at my mummy.’; I cried all the way there and for another half hour.; So, when Carole phoned up to say it was time to visit the Cancer Centre at Scotsdales for a spot of healing, I resisted, but realised before long that I was putty in her hands. She took me into the David Rayner building. ‘Just look around you, Hester,’ she said. ‘This place honestly works miracles.’; I looked. I didn’t really understand what she meant as it all seemed fairly normal. Quite a low ceiling. Smiley people chatting at tables. An animated art class going on in the corner. A lady serving tea and biscuits. I sat outside in dappled sun and chatted with Carole’s friends. They are serious survivors. They are very, very kind and mindfully welcoming. They say things in such a way as not to jar you, because they understand vulnerability. They really believe in and practise positive thinking. Some were told they had only months at best yet are still here twelve years later.; The centre co-ordinator, Ann, approached to say she could fit me in for healing with Dennis. I looked at Dennis. He seemed like a normal chap.; I had never been for healing before so had not one jot of an idea what to expect.; I lay down on a treatment table in a little room. I shut my eyes. I could hear Dennis taking a deep breath. He placed his hands on both of my shoulders. I felt a gentle bar of heat glowing between them. I could hear him moving around. He held my foot which felt really good. When he left my foot and came round up to my head I could still feel him holding my foot. Strange. Almost as if someone else had come into the room to help him with this enormous task that was my damaged body and spirit. He touched my right shoulder and I felt a whoosh go across my body towards my left hip. I realised my breathing had slowed down. Behind my eyelids a bright lime green colour started up. I could see one big eye, the colour of new leaves, pulsating, lined with yellow as if the sun was behind it. In the centre was a throbbing dark greyish blue area, like the pupil of the eye. I almost laughed as I wondered if it was my third eye opening up. I Spy with my Massive Eye, I chuckled to myself. It was enormous, much bigger than my normal eyes. But you can’t normally see your own eye. Shit, maybe it was someone else’s. I tried to go through the pupil and see out of the other side of it. No, that didn’t work.; From my shoulder the healer went down my arm with gentle slow touches til he reached my hand. He cupped the outside of my hand. When he took his hand away, my hand felt like it had a protective coating all round it. Like it had been laminated, or been given a shell. He did the same to the other shoulder, arm and hand. Both hands felt strong, curved, ready, protected. I revelled in the feeling. I was being strengthened. This was so lovely. I felt a profound urge to thank Dennis. I felt a strong need to tell my friend Rachel that maybe her ill friend could come for healing with Dennis. I felt honoured and privileged that this person whom I did not know was putting so much care and effort into making me better.; He placed his hands on my left hip and pushed slowly. He worked his way down the leg, did the other side, then held both feet. I felt warmth and contentment. I was alert and joyful. Plus the visuals at this point were intense, still lime green, with pulsating black suns outlined in white light.; He said something like, ‘OK, that’s all done now’.; I opened my eyes. ‘You have a real gift,’ I told him. ‘You really are so good at this.’; He was pleased. ‘I’m just channelling it,’ he replied. ‘Anyone can do it. Do you have children? Well, you have done it, whenever you cuddled them after they fell over.’; I thought of when I held Tabby’s hand when she was in the Trauma room. I had known that breathing love into her body through my hand gave her strength. It had certainly taken it out of me! I thought of Nanny Rene holding baby Chloe for hours, pouring love into her through her eyes and arms. I thought of all the hours I rocked and hugged my babies with a fierce protecting love. I remembered a concert where I suddenly understood that my Aunt Lindesay sitting at the piano had become a channel for the composer, Liszt, and that he was still alive, in the room, through the union of her interpretative skills and his work.; I thanked Dennis and came out of there beaming. The room no longer looked normal. It was glowing with promise and delight. Everybody seemed to be smiling. This happens in Greece quite often. You head out on a pirate ship round Cephalonia, Ithaka, Meganissi. You watch the way the boat cleaves the wine-dark sea. The captain comes round with his barrel of ouzo. (Not for me!) You dive in off the boat and swim into Papanikoli’s huge cave. The boat stops at a deserted beach for snorkeling and a barbeque with swordfish and salads. On the way back the wake of the boat hypnotises you with its foamy whorls. You lie back on mattresses on the deck squinting through sunlight at creaking masts and rigging above. Dolphins leap around the boat. Approaching Lefkada, you look around and realise that everyone on board has stopped talking. They are just smiling and smiling.; I sat back down outside. I told the survivors about the visuals. ‘Beginner’s luck’ they laughed, and told me it’s best to have healing three weeks in a row for maximum benefit.; Next week the healers are all booked up, but a very kind lady came round the table to tell me that I could have her appointment. ‘You need it more than me,’ she said.; ‘Are you sure?’ I asked. ‘Maybe you do need it.’; ‘No, no, I have had lots. I want you to have it,’ she insisted, and she went to the book and crossed out her name and put my name. On the website for the Cancer Centre it mentions ‘an almost tangible kindness.’ I have felt it. You can touch it.; So I am seeing Dulcie next week. Apparently she is a medium. Can’t wait. There is another healer there who has angels with her. Mad Lucy tells me this is not that uncommon. She knows several people who have angels with them.; Have felt really positive ever since the healing. I think about it and can re-experience the sense of calm I had, but can’t get the visuals. I have tried, even with a light shining on my shut eyes, but I only get a blank orangey-grey dull plain. No sign of a massive green eye.; The eye reminds me of when we used to play compound noun I-Spy in the car with the kids. One time little Alfie had us going with W-W. Did we ever try? Water Works. Wrist Watch. Windscreen Wipers. In the end we gave up. He said ‘It’s Wag Wort.’; Sure enough, the passing fields were full of yellow ragwort. How could we have missed that? Duh, stupid.; Bash was a bit too young to play. She would say ‘B-P’. We would guess for ages, then she would say, ‘No, it’s Cow.’ There wouldn’t even be a cow.; That reminds me of Tabby’s first day at Northgate school in Bishops Stortford. She came out and said ‘I have a new friend. She’s my reading partner.’; ‘That’s nice,’ I said. ‘What’s her name?’; ‘She’s called Orangerie,’ said Tabby confidently.; ‘Really?’ I asked. ‘Orangerie?’; ‘Yes, Orangerie,’ repeated Tabby.; God, Orangerie must have a very odd mother, I thought to myself. Who would call their kid Orangerie?; Before long, I met Anjani and her mother Arulesh, and discovered they were not that odd really.; It’s like when we had just moved to New York and the girls had heard us talking about excursions we could do. They woke us up jumping on the bed one day with this:; ‘Mummy, Daddy, can we go up the Plum Tyre Eight building?’; ‘The what?’ we said.; ‘The Plum Tyre Eight building,’ Chloe said.; ‘Wh..what is it?’ we asked faintly, feeling like we were in a surreal film.; ‘It’s de Plum…Tyre…Eight….building,’ repeated Tabby clearly, as if talking to two very thick foreigners.; Honestly, we so should have got it on vid and put it on Youtube (but there was no Youtube in them days). Oh, the laughs we do ave. They did get a trip up the Empire State building in the end, once we’d worked out what they were trying to say.",0,1,0.08083804376798008
819,33,99,31,12,2014,2014-12-31,"Ok, I’m out of it now. The feeling of doom has lifted after eight days. I am so grateful I feel like joining a gospel choir.; Wrote some bits the other day. Did not post as I did not want to scare my bladdicts. And people are so kind: if you post something a bit tragic, they all turn up with donuts and eclairs (Lesley), flowers (Jim), lemon drizzle cake (Karen), biccies (Vicky), messages galore, a fresh wave of snail mail containing an Inuit healing symbol sticker (thanks Luke!). Which is all jolly kind and lovely, but I am sorry that people had to respond to what must have seemed like a cry for help. And I have loads of help, I don’t need more help. The awful thing is, though, when you are in the thick of it, help cannot even help.; So anyway, now you can read it as you know I am safely through it. Phew. And I apologise to seasoned veterans of low moods, but you have to understand that for someone whose default setting has always been happy/delirious/giddy with good humour, my change in emotional health constituted a crisis.; ‘So I’m not gonna lie. It’s been awful. Feeling sick. Sick of food, sick of blog, sick of life. They go together.; I realise that whenever in life I have felt a bit crap, I could always make myself a nice boiled egg with salt and pepper and lovely chewy granary soldiers and a cup of tea. I have always enjoyed a wonderful appetite for food and life. Now food and even water can not help. Tea? Ugh. They do not comfort. They make you feel worse.; I expected this to lift. I am never down for long. Honestly, I am irrepressible and bounce. But it has not lifted. Friends have tried to help. Donuts and eclairs from Lesley. Belgique with Arulesh and Lesley. Ponies and breakfast with Debbie. Baroosh with one Tina and veggie burgers with the other Tina. Coffee with Juliet and Karen. Prezzo with Jaki. Green tea at Cath’s. Supper at Sabine’s. But all this did not get rid of it. Nothing can take away this shivery despair.; I keep seeing that even if my nodules happen to be OK, other people’s are not and will not be. We are all one suffering mass. The boundary between myself and others from present and past has disintegrated. How hopeless did Nanny Rene feel when cancer was getting her? How did Mike Ullmann feel when they told him he had only a few weeks? Fergus probably felt worse than this all the time, apart from when he was on a high. I’m so glad he at least had those highs.; This is a page from my book of plants which Fergus borrowed for his horticulture course. You can see his handwriting top right.; The close up of the handwriting looks like this:; The oncologist could have said I have twenty five large nodules in my lungs. What would I have done then? It’s random what they are going to say. We are not in control. I told Arulesh about this and she said ‘Hester, we are never in control. Of anything.’; I used to know this. I used to like it almost. The random nature of life was funny and threw up fun times. Now I’m just scared of it.; I have been moping about, crying. I have no control over that either. Tears just plop out of my eyes. Very strange. The cancer is not a joke anymore. The shock and energetic reaction to that has worn off. I am really in this thing now. I am re-mourning Ferg and other dead friends and relatives. The garden is bursting with Forget-me-nots. I look at them and creep back to the sofa with my blankie.; ………; I can’t get out of it. It’s not lifting. For some reason, this nodule thing has been a big blow. My psyche has been hit hard. And I’m dreading the next FEC already. I know why that clever woman doctor made me do T-FEC instead of FEC-T. FEC-T would have made me despair from the start.; ……….; I just wish I could get out of it. Will phone Xynergy Superfoods. Will go to Scotsdales Cancer Centre for therapy. Will phone Kate’s Yoga for Cancer woman. Need to redouble efforts. Yet I feel burnt out, like I can’t do any more. Even like it wouldn’t be that bad just to give up.’; See now why I did not want to post that? The Stiven Family Postcards alone would have broken the Postie’s back.; I suddenly realised maybe it wasn’t the nodules making me feel like this. Maybe it was a FEC side-effect. Most side-effects are physical. You expect physical, so you might miss mental.; Anyway, somehow I understood I was being stupid to put up with it. There are things you can do. I phoned the homeopath. (Actually, next time, please someone remind me to phone the homeopath.) I left a message on her machine: ‘Jane…. The Valley of the Shadow of Death is upon me.’; She phoned back quickly. ‘Hmm. I think you need some Arsenicum.’; ‘That makes sense,’ I replied. ‘I feel like I have been poisoned.’ Arsenicum is made of Arsenic. That nasty red stuff, Epirubicin, looked like a serious poison and the chemo nurse treated it like one. He didn’t take his eyes off it for a second.; ‘We’ll go in with a 1M,’ she suggested. ‘I’ll give you some 10M to take if it doesn’t do the job.’; Wow. 1M is already pretty strong, that is, very dilute. For the more mental levels you need a higher dilution. She could tell I had gone pretty mental, don’t know how lol.; I took the remedy on the way home. It’s easy as popping a tab. Under the tongue. Knew I had to go to bed when I got home. Felt deep inner recesses of the body start to unfold. Felt my mind kind of cave in on itself fractally until I was a long way in. Saw myself suspended in the dark void with a platinum grey object gleaming just in front of me. F*** knows what all that was about but felt like I was glimpsing something tres important.; Had another Arsenicum 1M before bed and slept all night. Woke up and gingerly waited for the gloom to descend. Cautiously expected tears to plop. So far they have not. Janet and David turned up saying they wanted to take over the kitchen and cook things. We chopped aubergine and courgettes and made guacamole with garlic, mango, coriander and chilli. Sat outside with a fire into the night. Janet understands everything, as she is a cancer survivor and has been there.; I am cautiously welcoming a return to life as I know it. Had breakfast of scrambled eggs from Ali’s hens. One was massive, brown and speckled. One was small, bluish, smooth. Janet added crushed tortilla chips and chilli. Mmm. With guacamole on the side. (for breakfast, I know, very odd. In Colorado they eat a lot of Mexican.); Went to the ponies with Janet. Brushed them and gave Princey his scratchy scratchies and necky rubs. He gets special treatment as he is 35 and probably on his last legs. Walked with Janet to my special beech tree which has a huge shady canopy and a pond. We picked wild flowers and cow parsley.; BTW on Friday I asked the vet about the nodules. She says nodules can be left behind after a simple chest infection and that there are many benign reasons for nodules.; Am still shaken, still feel a bit wobbly but I can see clearly now the rain has gone. Am feeling my way back into my voice, as it had completely deserted me.; I have learnt a new sum:; Nodules Shock + Red Poison + Sudden Changed Hormone Levels due to Chemo = Depression.; Took me a while to get, but it’s not hard, that maths.; Exciting News Flash: my friend and flute pupil Claire had her baby last Sunday: Agnes, 7lbs 5oz. We popped round to give her a squeaky giraffe and she is the most adorable, beautiful baby ever.",0,1,0.03653321595485774
827,38,10,1,2,2016,2016-02-01,"I see I did review a couple of these..... It's like high school all over again. I am assigned People ask me to review their book and write a report review. I love to read, and pretty much always agree that this is a good idea. What is better than supporting an author? In high school I geekily ended up reading the assigned book the first night. I was such a good student, I'm not quite sure how I graduated with an only 2.0 GPA. Anyway...those thick glasses came in handy, I was a reader. But somehow *cough ADD cough* I never did the report until the night before it was due, and then I'd be all crazy, writing until my hand cramped, staying up long past my parents went to bed, so busy scribbling I didn't have time to even to dot my i's with little hearts or smiley faces. (Yes, kids, back in those days we not only had to hand-write our papers, but we also had to draw our own emoticons. It was a primitive time). Now of course, I'm a mature adult. I get the book in the mail and read it immediately. And then I put it down to take a nap, as we adults must sleep a lot. The next day is chemo. On the third day, I decide to write about it but I just need to check facebook for a second......then instagram, then twitter, I don't want anybody left out. And, of course, I haven't played Zuma in a while so maybe just a few games. Wow, I'm tired, I better take a nap. (*see, adult) By then, ADD, compounded with chemo-brain is in full force and the entire thing slips my mind. Not only can't I remember that I had something to review, when I finally remember, the entire plot of the book has slipped my mind. Naturally, I have to flip through the book to refresh my memory, but where did I leave it? It isn't in my reading room, it isn't in my bed. It isn't anywhere! Did the dogs take it? I think those damn dogs have stolen them. I have to search under their beds and look behind their bones or under their basket of stuffed toys to try to find them. Yes, the dog ate my homework. Greyhound bookmarks And then because I have cancer and something hurts, and I can't walk around the house anymore, I think ""I'll do it later"" and then chemo brain takes over again, and I forget what I was doing. Until I remember again - and I go through this process over and over. In the meantime, these poor writers are waiting for me, just as I wait to hear a comment on a post. Eventually, they give up, sadly, and go about their lives of obscurity, all because I wouldn't review their book. It's very mean of me, to be honest. I'm a terrible person. It's amazing how few of them remind me of my forgetfulness. Perhaps they are sympathetic to my illness, or since many of them had chemo themselves, have completely forgotten about me. But one sharp writer recently (and kindly) asked, ""Hey, I didn't see your review of my book, did you ever post it?"" Um. I thought I did actually. Unlike many, I remembered her because I see her on facebook. I may have posted a review on facebook as I sometimes do. But you can't really go through old stuff on facebook and look easily. However, I told her it'd be on my blog, and a search of this blog shows I never did review it here. So, I need to be honorable and do what I said, so I began the search. And this time, the dogs hadn't stolen it. But when I found her book, guess what? There was an entire stack of cancer books underneath it. At this point, with a few exceptions, I don't remember what I was asked to read and what I read on my own, what I reviewed and didn't. Considering I have a PET scan tomorrow that could give me the worst possible news, I think I better get this off my conscience, don't you? So I am going to mention them all, with the exception of a couple I know I did review, or ones I think I bought myself. They aren't going to get a full-fledged review anymore but I can assure you that each one I enjoyed and all are worth reading. I feel miserable and guilty but what can I do? I'm just a chemo-addled, ADD, crazy, lazy woman with dogs who like to read. So here goes. Renee in Cancerland by Renee Sendelbach. Renee writes the blog, Team S, Living with Stage IV Cancer and is an amazing woman. This is a touching and brave book about her life with metastatic cancer, which is in her brain. If you are looking for a grammatically perfect book, this is not for you. There are some typos and errors in grammar, as would be expected for somebody whose cancer is in the brain. (And who am I to judge?) Don't take that to mean that she has nothing to say. She goes deep into the heart of what it is like to live with a devastating illness that she knows will take her life. She writes about her love for her husband and children, her hopes and fears. There are photos of herself and family, and she shares the life lessons she's learned, along with a bit of poetry and a lot of artwork sprinkled in. (She's a talented artist.) This is raw insight into the thoughts and experiences of a metastatic cancer patient, and I recommend it. I support her fully, and taking on a book when you have gone through the treatment she has - it's pretty much incredible. Kicking Cancer to the Curb, by Carole Miele. Despite the title, Carol has been living with metastatic cancer since 2010; hers is in the bone. Carole has been an advocate for cancer patients, likely because of her nursing profession. Her book is full of advice, such as what people should say to patients with mets, and what not to say. She also describes her experience of living with metastatic disease, including things like mental and spiritual changes. She shares defining moments in her life that shaped her thinking as she faced this catastrophic disease. There are poems and quotes that are meaningful to a cancer patient. Her goal in writing the book is to impart information, support and approaches she has learned to make the experiences of others less burdensome, and she was highly successful. If you have mets you will get support and advice here. Beauty After Breast Cancer by Katelyn Carey and Joseph Linaschke. It's hard to imagine a cancer coffee table book, but this is as close to one as you will get. Katelyn is a nurse who had DCIS. When she discovered she needed a mastectomy, she realized there were no realistic photos showing what she might look like. She's right, it is a complaint all patients have - we want to SEE what we may look like, and yet there is nothing available. Sure, plastic surgeons may have photos, but they only show their best case scenarios, and those photos are unrelatable - it is a woman standing straight forward, her eyes obliterated if you see her face at all, and a lifeless torso from front to side - they are the mug shots of mastectomy. There is no life in those photos and so nothing that we can see that gives us knowledge or hope. So Katelyn decided to gather women who have had breast surgery and take realistic photos of women living their lives, with the hopes that book ends up in physician's offices. In this book, women will not only see what breast surgery looks like, but learn that this surgery will not end their beauty. This book is full of women with single, double, partial mastectomies, with and without reconstruction - surgeries of all type. Each tell their cancer story alongside their photos. They are not models, they are regular woman who had cancer and who overcame this body changing experience. Not only do you get reality, you get it in a way that shows beauty does not leave just because cancer invaded your life. The professional and gorgeous photos of women is full of joy, and the attitude is that they may have lost a body part, but they didn't lose what is most important. Bravery is beauty, not breasts.™ This should be in every single breast surgeon's office. I will be donating my copy, as beautiful as it is, to my own breast surgeon. I always thought I should pop in and say hi to see if he remembers me. Old-timers here will remember Rockstar Raja! My Healthcare is Killing me! by Julie Klein. I thought this book was hilarious, and I really liked it - but to me, it didn't have much to do with the description. She said she had to confront indifferent and insensitive doctors, bureaucratic policies that prevented her from getting timely care and was in a healthcare maze. I expected her to not get treatment and have to deal with cruel physicians and be on the phone all the time fighting, and it didn't seem that she had a more difficult time than most of us have, in fact, it was - easier in many ways. As I read it though, I thought that she seemed to have pretty good insurance and her doctors seemed quite patient. It is interesting the different perspective we can have about the same thing, isn't it? Aside from that difference, I thought her well-written and funny descriptions of her anxiety and the problems she faced going through breast cancer were all too spot-on, and I'm jealous at how funny she actually is. Her characters are well drawn, her descriptions vivid and I found it charming. Definitely worth a read if you are newly diagnosed. Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, by Dr. Susan Love. I don't think this book needs much description - if you are reading my blog you have likely heard of Dr. Susan Love. This book is considered the ""bible"" of breast health. She came out with an update so that is what I have read. My complaint with this version is the same as my complaint with the last - there isn't much about metastatic cancer. It takes 509 pages before we get a chapter about mets (which ends 60 pages later) and that chapter is not only about mets, but includes regional relapse too. If memory serves, this is more space than last version, but still not very detailed. No matter, this is the comprehensive book explaining pretty much every aspect of breasts and breast cancer. This is the first book I think anybody diagnosed with cancer should get. There are checklists, definitions, and basic information about breast cancer that everybody should know. Don't let the size put you off, you don't have to read it cover to cover, just find the parts of interest. You will handle your cancer much better if you have this as a reference. You should know what the details mean. When Cancer Hits Home by Patrick Maguire, MD Not specifically about breast cancer, Dr. Maguire takes the most common cancers and gives an overview of each. He starts with a patient story, then describes Risks and Causes, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnosis, Staging, and Treatment. He seems to think that risk for cancers can be reduced by outside methods, something I'm not so sure about, but the descriptions and stories of each cancer will help anybody who may have cancer in their family and wants to monitor the details. Dr. Maquire has a degree in English, which means this is a well-written book. A good, general reference for cancer. Bald is Better with Earrings, by Andrea Hutton This is subtitled ""a Survivor's Guide to Getting Through Breast Cancer"" and it is chock full of tips for managing the symptoms that come with chemo, radiation and a mastectomy. There are tips on managing your port, your nails and your poor hair. It is an amusing and insightful how-to guide for getting through early-stage cancer treatment, one I highly recommend it. Death, by Todd May Confession: this one is written by my cousin, who is a professor of Philosophy at Clemson University. I have only met him once in my life and we haven't spoken in 40 years and he has no idea that I am sick so this is not pushing a family book. I wasn't asked to review it - I was given this book by my uncle and found that it was fascinating. He writes from the perspective of an atheist (guess it runs in the family) but does not diminish the role of religion in facing death. He writes about what it is like to be human beings who understand our mortality and know what it means and to go on living in spite of knowing our end. While it certainly reads like a professor wrote it, he brings up fascinating questions about the role death plays in our lives and our society. Pilates for Breast Cancer Survivors, by Naomi Aaronson and Ann Marie Turo. I must have said yes to this book when I was in remission and thought I could get healthy again. Since the book hadn't been opened, I likely got the news of my relapse around the time it arrived. I confess, I didn't read it in depth but I don't think it's necessary. We all know Pilates is good for you, and this book has exercises for breast cancer patients with modifications for the injuries we sustain, and even the surgeries we have (such as DIEP or TRAM). They also understand lymphedema and work around that. Despite the fact that I didn't read it or go through it in detail, I VERY MUCH recommend it. I had a terrible time after my mastectomy, and had I exercised or had a program like this, I might not be living with the shoulder pain that I have today, 6 years after that surgery. Everybody who has breast surgery MUST do an exercise program. Period. A Cancer Companion, by Ranjana Srivastava, MD Written by an oncologist, there is practical advice on what to expect after diagnosis, (including how to find an oncologist), what to expect before and after treatments both physically and emotionally. While she doesn't focus on any particular type of cancer, she does describes the basics that are the same for everybody: what hearing ""you have cancer"" can do to you, what an oncologist should say, what to expect during chemo, how appetite may be affected - even what to say to your kids. The book is written in a accessible, conversational way. It is definitely a good book - and advice from an oncologist is always good to have, don't you think? I hope I didn't leave any off. From now on, if I do a book review, I'll post it on facebook as it is a place I find quick and easy to do and then I won't get so far behind. My final recommendation is one that I just read on my own, called: When Breath Becomes Air by by Paul Kalanith This book is in an entirely different category. It is an unbelievably beautiful book, with gorgeous prose, written by a physician who died of cancer. Paul captured the thoughts and feelings that those of us experience in such a truthful, graceful, unsparing way that it left me in tears. We may be able to understand and accept that we are going to die but we still feel the ineffable sadness at the loss of our future and frankly, at the knowledge of our obliteration, and Paul worked through this struggle and shared it with us. It's a jewel of a book, this reflection on mortality. It will make you gasp with the beauty of his words and weep at the losses that cut so deep. We all die, and as a neurosurgeon Paul knew that better than most. Coming to grips with it at a young age is a struggle, as I well know. In the end, we look through our lives to see what our legacy will be. He left behind two beautiful things: his daughter and this book. I believe it will be read for years to come and become the definitive book on human mortality. It's simply beautiful. I cannot recommend it enough but buy tissues for when you read it and you are warned - it is a hard read for those of us who are also in his shoes. I really wish I could add, ""Breast Cancer? But Doctor, I Hate Pink"" to this list but the publisher/editor I had was not working out. She was a small, one person publisher, and I suspect that she didn't really have time to turn this blog into a book and after many months, still had not worked on it, giving me excuse after excuse. So if you are a publisher who does want to publish my blog....give me a heads-up. (I do not have the time or energy to self-publish, and I admire the women above who have!)",0,1,0.1506890193740844
828,38,11,1,12,2015,2015-12-01,"Tomorrow is my chemo day and my second infusion of Kadcyla/TDM-1. Tomorrow also marks six years since I've been going in. It is my treatment anniversary. December 2nd, 2009 was my first-ever chemotherapy infusion. I remember sitting in the treatment room for the first time, nervous about the chemo I was being given and wondering how my body would react, and feeling like it was all so strange. I got used to going in over time, it even felt familiar, like a second home. Yet of course, I looked forward to the end of therapy. As I finished my original treatment, the nurses gave me a certificate and they all congratulated me. I took a deep, happy breathe and walked out, thinking I would never have to go back and my butt would never touch a barcalounger again. I was grateful to be done. And just three months later, mets were suspected, confirmed in May - and I went right back to the infusion room and that ugly chair. What ""seemed"" endless at the beginning turned out to actually be endless. I have learned how to live with an incurable illness: with the fear, the pain, being sick, losing parts of my life bit by bit. I've learned that all that really matters is the people in your life, and I have learned that most people are incredibly kind. Still, there are many who cannot see past themselves. They are too needy to help you or hear you. Some ignore you and disappear. Some brush off what you say. Some tell you what to do or what not to do as if it is some sort of talisman that will protect them from your fate. Many will not extend the type of kindness to you that you need or ask for; and they are unable to understand the hard place you are in, they can only see themselves. They can't understand the difficulty in learning to face your own death - your obliteration - or understand that you are living with real suffering beyond what they may know. What feels like a lack of caring and dismissal hurts more than it would if you were healthy and not experiencing your impending death, because you know there is no time for change or understanding. It feels hopeless, and so rather than try to explain or continue on, we must let go for our own mental health. One wants to imagine that somebody will wake up and understand, but the reality is that they will not - even after you have died. Their own viewpoint is the only one they can see. Many people go through life that way, with blinders on, not only unable to see you, but unable to see anybody. But this makes the ones who do try to understand, who are generous and humble and kind, who try to learn, so much more special. And if you reading this, you fall into that category, and I'm grateful for you. When I originally started my blog and my facebook page, I did it because I wanted to let people know that it was possible to get through cancer treatment and to the other side. I had no doubt that is where I would be. I am a normal person, nobody special, had no amazing life, was a school secretary and a mom. If I can do cancer treatment, anybody can. So I described the tests, the mastectomy, chemo, biopsies - I wrote about what it was like from my perspective, to demystify cancer treatment for anybody who came along and wanted to know what it was like. When I -shockingly- found out that death would be my outcome, I decided to keep it up. We need to demystify death in this country too - we are so far away from it. So now I write from the point of view of somebody who will not survive cancer. And many people can accept that, and some - well, they cannot. I am still here, six years later. It is increasingly unlikely that I will be here in another six years. Even six months seems iffy these days, although I am early into my latest chemo and I can be lucky and have it shrink my tumors. I imagine I will find that out in a couple months. But now my life is harder, and full of pain. I don't want this blog to be a litany of complaints, but I also want it to be true. They say that when it is in your liver it isn't very painful, but mine is now across my abdomen and in the lungs. So there is certainly pain that I am having difficulty controlling. There is no doubt that the end feels much closer than it used to, but that may be the pain talking. I don't think dying of cancer is a very easy thing to do. Remember, what we Stage 4 metsters want most is understanding, so if you know one of us, the kindest thing you can do is just listen. Happy Anniversary to me. .",0,1,0.11567193675889324
829,38,12,28,1,2016,2016-01-28,"""When it comes to cancer, time matters."" C. Anthony Blau It's my belief that we are at the very start of cancer research. If you think about how much more we know than we did 50 years ago, sure, we have made great strides; some cancers that were formerly incurable now have treatments that allow people to live a normal lifespan. CML is one great example. But those breakthroughs are few and far between, and for people like me, who have languished for four years with metastatic disease, basically waiting to die - it is not enough. Other areas of our life are unrecognizable from before. 60 years ago, there were no computers, no internet, no cell phones, no satellite TV. Look what we have now. Yet, the way cancer research is conducted, despite the new tools, is not that much different than it used to be. That can and should be fixed, and I am writing about somebody who wants to be at the forefront. I have written a lot about the problem with the philanthropic end of breast cancer, and it is common knowledge that I believe that many charities don't give enough money to metastatic research. But I don't often write about the problems with research itself. I did talk about it when I was at SXSW 2015, and I have eagerly watched the process of ASCO's CancerLinQ. I became concerned about that idea though, when ASCO started putting value on cancer patient's lives. I truly feel they should be expenditure-neutral. Aside from them, I see nobody else trying to put patient data into the cloud to learn from it, and it has saddened that medical research seem to be stuck in a time warp. Wait, you haven't been following this? What do I mean? Who is doing research? Well, the research that will eventually turn into a treatment for you is done by very smart people in labs at cancer institutions, medical schools, government labs and pharmaceutical companies. They don't work together, just as individual businesses don't work together. They are each answering to their own stakeholder. Yes, I believe they all want to solve this terrible problem; these are human beings who have had mothers and sisters and fathers with cancer. I believe in altruism and I know a lot of people go into this field to solve the cancer mystery. But rules are rules. The way it works now, research may be repeated across the world. Grants are only funded if they fit existing theories about how cancer works - that means the genius who has a brilliant out-of-the-mainstream idea has little recourse in getting that idea heard. Any difference in cellular or genetic properties could be the breakthrough we need and could be turned into a treatment, but each individual only works in their own little area and cannot step out. A research doctor asking for a grant proposal knows that only 20% of ALL ideas are even funded and approvals require small, next level thinking - not the leaps we need. Steps are slow and incremental. Even when something has made the cut, going through the long process, getting it to the clinic - to you, the patient, is very slow. Imagination is no longer a valued commodity when it comes to research. Yes, safety is important but for those of us who are terminal, we might be willing to throw some safety out the door for an improved chance at life. In this era of Big Data, it no longer has to be this way. Big Data has the power to put information at every single researcher's fingertips, and enable the magical discovery that may advance the understanding of cancer. I'm not alone in thinking this way. Please watch this amazing video from Dr. C. Anthony Blau, Professor of Hematology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His area of interest is metastatic triple negative breast cancer. This video is ten minutes long and I really think you should take the time to watch, as he can explain to you much more than I can, in a better way. You will stand up and cheer at the end, I promise. I had the honor of speaking to him. He has developed a web-based tool called the Tumor Crowd Modeling Platform, This is designed to so that cancer patients can upload their molecular and lab data for comments by experts around the world. If you have had your tumor sequenced, you can uupload it to the cloud, and specialists, cancer researchers and experts from any discipline across the world can look through the data. Maybe somebody may see connections that cause a spark, and who knows? Maybe come up with the next Geevac or Herceptin. Or, maybe they'll find something that they they can recommend to just one you. That, in fact, has already happened. Dr. Blau told me that nobody has ever said no in answering a question about a mutation that was found that seemed different, no matter what institution they work for, what papers were published or about to be. Researchers get back to their roots and want to help. Dr. Blau asked me if I thought this was something cancer patients would be interested in, and my answer? Hell yes. There are some very difficult issues he has to surmount. Money. Finding people with the ability to get their tumor sequenced and have it uploaded. Money. The fear of patient identification. (Not my fear). Money. But this is the type of thinking that in 2016 we need. If I am wrong, you can post below. If I am right, you can post below.

830,38,13,3,2,2016,2016-02-03,"Top of the roller coaster - again The sweetest words in the English language include, ""I love you"" and ""You won the powerball, here is a check for 1.3 billion."" And, of course, ""Pathological Complete Response."" I have been lucky enough to hear two out of three of those phrases. After being in remission for a year, my PET scan of October showed ""moderately extensive metastatic disease."" Cancer was spreading all through my abdomen and spots were appearing in my lungs. I was resigned, because this is the way cancer goes, but damn. I just bought a car, I have a teenager who has a couple years left of college and my older son is getting married. My stepdaughter has the most beautiful child on earth and I am not done admiring him. I didn't think I was about to drop dead, but I was worried I could be on my last year of life. I pictured 2016 on my headstone. I had intense pain (which is how it got diagnosed) and couldn't eat. Living in the world of cancer advocacy, I know way too many women who heard about a spread and died a few weeks later; this disease can move fast. I feared the next woman mourned online could be me. October Scan After discovering this new spread, my doctor put me on TDM1, aka Kadcyla. After 4 infusions, we wanted to see how it was doing. Since my pain had dropped from an 8 to a 4, I was hopeful. I had a scan yesterday, and today, I heard those sweet, sweet words. I have a complete response to this chemo. Nothing that looks like cancer to a scanning machine is left in my body. Even the tiny spots in the lungs are gone. I have heard NED twice now. I am incredibly lucky. Many women with metastatic cancer do not get this kind of news - ever. I know a few who had a couple spots of bone mets that were stopped early and never progressed even years later, but most, like me, do chemo after chemo after chemo, cancer growing and retreating, until nothing works and then it's hospice time. Very few get to hear NED twice, at least, in my (admittedly limited) experience. I have an amazing medical team - a fantastic doctor. I can't say enough good things about everybody there. But so do others, there are many good doctors and caring nurses - for some reason, my body responds well to drugs that act on HER2. We need more of these drugs, and more for other cancers. I typically don't ask prognosis questions but I couldn't help squeaking out, ""How long do you think it will last?"" My doctor just looked at me quizzically, and I remembered, he doesn't have his crystal ball. I've been around this block, it could come back in 2 months or stay gone for years. That's why I normally don't ask. I smiled and said, ""Never mind."" I'll take it as it comes. That is what we with mets earn to do, and it is not a lesson that can be lost. Go ahead, knock me down. I dare you! In a way, as great as this news is, I feel like one of those punch ball ""bop"" dolls. Remember when you were a kid and had one? At first, you could punch and kick the shit out of them and they kept rising defiantly. Eventually, you'd punched them so much the air dissipated and they would lie tiredly on the floor for a second before they came up slowly - but they still rose; weaker but with determination. After some time, wrinkles appeared and half their body would remain flopped over, but the other half? It still arose. It was down but not totally out. Eventually, you'd put them in your toybox and close the lid. Emotionally, I am realizing - holy crap, I have to spend more years in treatment, still going to doctors, getting chemo, getting scans, managing pain, not healthy enough to work but wishing to do more, and never knowing the future. Chemo every three weeks, ad infinitum. I've heard the best news possible, but cancer isn't gone. I'm in treatment forever. My life is about continuing to be beaten and rising again. And then I think HOLY CRAP!!! I GET TO SPEND MORE TIME GOING TO TREATMENT!!! HOW LUCKY CAN I BE? Go ahead cancer, kick me. I'm still popping up, and it looks like I will be for a while. So my goal (again) is to pump some more air in, in the form of food and healthy lifestyle so I can pop up with a bit more energy. I am not hitting that toybox for a while. I asked my nurse if she'd seen anybody have my response after all the treatment I'd been through, and she said no. Everybody seemed elated at my news. My nurse took a walk down memory lane, remembering how sick I'd been a couple of years ago on Gemzar. My doctor laughed, ""Now you have a good blog post."" He's right. Statistics state that 22% of women diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer live five years. Median life expectancy is 2 years. It will be 5 years for me in May; the month my oldest son marries. There are no statistics for how many live 10 years probably because few do. I don't know why I am lucky enough to get to hear this news, again, when so many wonderful, lovely people don't get to hear it even once. But if I give any woman hope: that it can be them, that metastatic breast cancer is something that some of us live with for a while, maybe a long while, that dreams can still come true and goals reached - than I will keep going and posting and putting myself out there. I will do what I can to help metastatic women, help our voices be heard. It is not an easy life; it's a life with unique challenges, but it's a beautiful one. I know I needed to see people like me back when I was diagnosed, to know it was possible to live past what you see and hear online. So here I am. When I told my youngest son, he said, ""You are crazy good at fighting cancer."" Yes. Yes I am. The Sweetest Words",0,1,0.17617905102426132
831,38,14,11,1,2016,2016-01-11,"""Mom, are you going to make deviled eggs for the party? I haven't had those in a while."" I hadn't planned that particular menu item, but when your son is home from college and makes a request...well, it becomes reality - at least if this mother has anything to do with it. Damn kid tricked me into loving him and wanting to do things for him. He's 18, a sophomore in college, and 6 foot tall. All I can do for him now is make an egg. (And pay for college.) ""Sure."" I add eggs to my shopping list. We have an appetizer spread Christmas Eve. It's a tradition I started when I married my husband. Previously, the only thing that happened on Christmas Eve was a hopefully Silent Night. Tradition stated that the kids got to open one present in the evening - always new pajamas and a book to read in bed. This ""Mommy, can we open just one present, just one.....pleeeeeease?"" appeasement was supposed to help them sleep on that most exciting of nights. A good book and soft, comfy PJs with a stern warning to stay in bed was wrapped and ready for them each Christmas Eve. Change happens. Being a single mom and marrying a man with two daughters meant I needed to be flexible and get creative about holiday traditions. I knew their mother would want the girls for Christmas, so I tried to find way to make it easy and fun for everybody. I came up with the idea of a Christmas Eve party. I put out a spread, and we drink hot cider, eat a bunch of appetizers, and open gifts before the big day. Christmas Day was the day Santa came for little kids. Christmas Eve became family gift day. Two days of fun, what kid would complain about that? The tradition has stuck over the years, long after Santa moved on and the girls grew up. This year my stepdaughter's son - my beautiful grandchild - is 18 months old - almost old enough to understand something wonderful happens this day. I fear another change will happen soon as they live nearly 100 miles away. At some point, travel might become impossible. But at least for this year, our now firmly entrenched holiday traditions continue. Now is all that counts for any of us. Honoring my son's desire, I stood by the sink, peeling eggs, Christmas music Serial playing in the background. I had boiled just enough eggs to fill all sections of my vintage deviled egg plate. I cracked the next egg and started to peel it. I mindlessly chipped off a piece of shell and then another. I was just prying up a flake here and there with my fingernail. I kept trying, mostly engrossed in the podcast, the egg smooth in my hands, California water immorally flowing from the faucet as I washed off chip after chip. After ten minutes, I suddenly realized I was getting nowhere; the egg was still mostly shell. Chip, bang, flick - tiny piece by piece - that egg would not peel. You've all been there, I'm sure. I tried to get to that air pocket in the ends of the eggs, but nope, it didn't exist. I banged the egg on the counter and rolled it around to crack it fully, but nothing happened, it wouldn't peel. I couldn't find that weird skin in this egg that would allow the shell to slide off. Each time I grabbed a piece with my weak nails, the weaker skin tore. That shell was firmly glued on. Shoot. I'd done 7 eggs with no problem, but the 8th egg was one of ""those"" - the kind that are impossible to open, some sort of genetically mutated glue masquerading as egg. Usually when I come across one of those modest eggs who refused to become undressed, I usually give it up, rip off the white and expose the little green ball of yolk to just use for filling, but this time I needed a whole egg to complete the plate. So there I stood, chipping minuscule pieces off, slowly, like the baby chicken itself was trying to hatch with its tiny soft beak. At the 30 minute mark I said out loud, ""This is ridiculous!"" I cursed myself for only boiling as many as I needed. I realized that my timing for getting the food on the table was behind because of this one, stupid egg. Still, I kept at it. Chip. Chip. Millimeter by millimeter I picked off shell, finally ending up with a whole, perfect egg. Whew. My platter would be complete. My son would have his deviled eggs. A couple of months ago in October, my being able to stand up and make even something simple like a deviled egg seemed an impossibility. I was truly, fearfully sick. I was unable to eat and had lost weight; weight that I could not afford to lose, dipping into the 80s. I was having terrible pain in my abdomen - rolling on the floor pain - pain bad enough so that a normal person would have gone to the hospital. No pain med would help. It gnawed on me even in my sleep. After testing, new cancer was found throughout my abdomen and chest, and I started a new chemo, which made me sick - nauseated, tired, and which incredibly, increased my pain. I was truly feeling like this was the beginning of the end, and there would be no Christmas party, no appetizers, maybe not even a me. I hoped to do our normal Christmas, but I really felt like it wasn't going to happen. Not that I would be dead, but that I'd be in bed. In November I started TDM-1 aka Kadcyla. (All HER2 metastatic woman who have dealt with cancer for a while say that - ""TDM-1 aka Kadcyla"". Most of us watched the progress of this drug through the FDA approval system, so still think of it as the test name) My first infusion was awful, like movie chemo. I was on my hands and knees, vomiting. I had every side effect, from constipation to heartburn to neuropathy. Everything hurt. I felt better just in time to get my next infusion, which was easier on me, the nausea down to just a few days. Then, some of my cancery symptoms were gone. By my third infusion, December 23rd, surprisingly, I felt much better. Pain is now down to a livable level (although it is still more than anybody should have to deal with and that is another blog post) and sometimes, if I'm vewwy vewwy still, I don't hurt at all. I'm still tired but that can be managed, and the nausea, for the most part, is gone. Incredibly, I can eat again, without pain. I will have a scan in the next month or so to see what the treatment is doing, and I feel pretty positive about it. Can I once again be responding to a chemo? I cannot imagine I can feel this normal and still have cancer spreading and growing throughout my system, although by now I know anything can happen. Christmas lives, and so do I. The appetizer party continues. Like all who have metastatic cancer, my mind can be consumed with ""lasts."" As my time on earth dwindles, as I know it is, I wonder more about what will happen when I am gone. What traditions will live on? It may be my last holiday - but will it be the last gathering for my family too? Just as I was the one who decided on the Christmas Eve party, I am also the one who is in charge of all gatherings. Every celebration is spent here: Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, my husband's birthday. The planning, the cooking, the invitations, the timing, the gift purchasing, the entertaining - all decisions, it's all up to me, even these days. My husband now goes to the store for me, and helps clean, but still, for the most part, I am the planner, and fortunately, I have been able to keep it up. What happens when I'm gone? Will my husband continue having family over for Christmas Eve appetizers? For Easter? A barbecue on his birthday? Will he do the planning and work involved, or will he become a guest, invited to one house or another? Will the various sides of our family still gather together or will they all go separate ways as more children enter the mix and travelling gets more difficult? What changes will happen without me being the host, I wonder? I've worked hard for our home to be the touchstone, the place where relationships are renewed and we all catch up, and I wanted it to be the place where we watch the kids grow. Will that happen still? Or, when I am gone, will differences chip away at the family until it is no more? Maybe that would that have happened anyway. It's natural for people to move on and start new traditions, as I did so long ago. It takes work to keep a family together, to keep traditions going. I love family celebrations, enough to spend 30 minutes picking at an egg. Does the rest of my family? I'll never know.",0,1,0.06911787043365988

I am trying to keep to a schedule and upload one every aka Mets Monday. If I don't give myself a deadline, I don't do things. They are silly and unprofessional, but I am just learning. It's slightly irritating that I'm struggling to figure out how to make something that my kid, and pretty much every kid, knows how to do instinctually by age 9. How do these young people just know this stuff, anyway? My son once created a stop-motion video of a puzzle game putting itself together, and he did it quickly and perfectly - pretty much the first time he ever made a video. He just shrugged when I was amazed. It would take me weeks to figure that out, and I can't even blame chemo-brain here. As much as I want to blame every mental mistake or bit of slowness on chemo-brain, there are times I have to admit that I'm just suffering from being in my 50s.

834,38,3,7,2,2016,2016-02-07,"There has been conversation on twitter from women with metastatic breast cancer, upset because they believe the Federal Government's ""cancer moonshot"" ignores women with our disease. This puzzled me. When I read the bullet points of what the Feds hope to do I don't see how metastatic cancer patients cannot benefit. This Moonshot is, of course, meant to be inclusive of all cancers, but in my view, Metastatic cancer is implied all over the place, including breast. That's the problems with twitter, we couldn't explain each other's position or ideas in 140 charactors. So I will share mine here. How does the moonshot help metastatic breast cancer patients? First, you must read the goals as listed by the White House. They are laudable goals, and if I had any confidence in government, I'd be really excited. However, we have been fighting a ""war on cancer"" since Nixon's days, and the the truth is, I am not a believer in the government's ability to fix the problem of cancer (or any problem, really.) However, for purposes of explaining that their plans are intended to help metastatic patients, let's take them at face value and examine what they want to do Let's take the bullet points one by one: Prevention and Cancer Vaccine Development. The complaint is about the word ""prevention."" I don't have a problem with working to prevent cancer but it is true, working on prevention is unlikely to help a metastatic breast cancer patient. However, there is nothing wrong with prevention as a goal, as long as it's not the only goal. Fortunately, it isn't. Remember, bullet point one doesn't only say Prevention, it also says Vaccine Development. which has already proven to be of benefit to metastatic patients. Vaccines for cancer are in its infancy, but there have already been vaccines that have been developed to help metastatic people and those with the worst, most aggressive cancers. There have been small studies that show vaccines have helped people with deadly brain tumors, two conducted by Duke University. One studied tetanus, one studied a re-engineered polio vaccine in patients with glioblastoma with excellent results. (That one was shown on 60 minutes, and passed around the cancer community). Vaccines are not for prevention only. There are several types of vaccines being looked at to help the most advanced forms of cancer. Tumor cell vaccines are made from actual cancer cells that have been removed from the patient during surgery (metastatic as well) and are being studied in breast cancer (as well as glioblastoma, prostate cancer and others.) One is in trial now for breast cancer patients who are stage four, called NeuVax, for HER2+ women. GVAX, a therapeutic vaccine made from breast cancer cell lines irradiated and engineered to express the immune molecule GM-CSF, is being tested in a phase II trial in patients with stage 4 breast cancer that does not overexpress HER2. There are more being studied for metastatic people. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say Early Cancer Detection I agree that putting money into early cancer detection will not help a metastatic cancer patient. Since we do not yet know what causes mets, early detection doesn't seem to be the answer to stopping it. Most of us with metastatic breast cancer, indeed, were caught early stage. But if, in the early detection science, we learn how cancer metastasizes, that could be of value. If they are only going to focus on finding cancer (mammograms) rather than understanding it, this section will be a waste. But we must remember that the moonshot is not only for breast cancer, and some types of cancer are quite difficult to find at an early stage, such as Ovarian. Finding ovarian cancer early does seem to lead to much easier treatments and a potential cure. Liquid biopsies fit under this umbrella, and they may truly find cancer early enough to lead to a cure. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Cancer Immunotherapy and Combination Therapy: Immunotherapy is what has kept me alive. I would have been dead two years ago without it. Immunotherapy is Herceptin, Perjeta, TDM-1 (Kadcyla), all of which have helped me as a metastatic cancer patient. CDX-011 is being studied for triple negative cancer. There is immunotherapy for many cancers - Rutuxan for Leukemia and Lymphoma. And breakthroughs move to different cancers: Herceptin has used in stomach and lung cancers, and who knows how more it may help? We must have many more therapies that help a patient's own immune system to fight cancer. More targeted therapies too, like Gleevac. Most metsters are on combination therapy - herceptin/perjeta, or ibrance and faslodex. Studying which combos can be more effective can only help metsters. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say Genomic Analysis of Tumor and Surrounding Cells. This is critical for understanding cancer and especially metastasis. Once we do gene sequencing and can analyze and compare genetic mutations, we can find out which cancers will spread, which may never spread, maybe stop them from spreading, stop them from spreading more. The possibilities are endless. We may learn the deep mysteries of cancer by focusing on genomic analysis which is critical for not only metsters, but every single person with cancer. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Enhanced Data Sharing, As I shared recently, Big Data, along with genomic sequencing, is going to be the answer to cancer. Every cancer may be like a snowflake, with mine different than others with HER2+. Why have I responded to Perjecta and Kadcyla so well, and others haven't? If we could sequence my genes, and the genes of others like me, and not like me, and find that one difference that helps me respond, we learn something incredibly important. We could unlock the the mechanism of metastasis with a searchable database of cancer mutations. And if genius cancer researcher Dr. X at Duke has an idea, and genius biologist like Dr. Y at Caltech have an idea, and a genius geneticist Dr. Z at MIT have an idea, and they can access this database and see something from their own unique perspective, perhaps they can come up with new and better treatments, or a cure for all stages of cancer. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Oncology Center of Excellence. Okay, this is just another government agency which will likely come up with a lot of bureaucratic junk that slows everything down. Sorry, but that's what happens. Unless they let doctors and researchers do their thing, which is unlikely. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Pediatric Cancer They plan to spend more on pediatric cancers, which I am not complaining about. And they will be studying metastatic pediatric patients certainly. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Vice President’s Exceptional Opportunities in Cancer Research Fund: They say, ""To launch the National Cancer Moonshot, scientists, cancer physicians, advocates, philanthropic organizations, and representatives of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry will need to work together to focus on major new innovations in the understanding of and treatment for cancer."" Sounds nice but once again, too many cooks in the kitchen, too many people with competing interests. This could be a disaster. My personal opinion is only cancer researchers, scientists, physicians and biotech should work on this. Start adding advocates and philanthropic organizations and it starts to get balkanized and you start to get people worried about their own cancer and their own interests. And, you get people who read this and don't see ""metastatic breast cancer"" mentioned and because of the lack of three little words start being unable to see the forest for the trees. Give scientists money and let them do their thing. However, they go on to say: ""The work that the Vice President will be undertaking will ensure just that – bringing together all parties, breaking down silos, and sharing data to generate new ideas and new breakthroughs."" They are so right. The silos of each individual cancer/philanthopy organization/research institution has always problematic. When we don't work together, when we don't see commonalities, we can't solve the problem. If we can truly break down silos and share information about CANCER, in general, find out what is similar and what is different in every way it appears - we can make huge progress. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say In this world of cancer, we advocates also need to break down the silos of our own particular disease state and start realizing a win for one is a win for all. The word ""metastatic"" doesn't have to be there if the entire design of the program will help benefit metastatic patients, breast as well as others. Let's not miss the big picture. If this works as envisioned, we could solve cancer in my lifetime, the way we have basically solved AIDS. But we must see the big picture and support scientists and the ultimate goal of this moonshot instead of attacking it for minor things Unfortunately, since the 1960s, our country doesn't have a very good track record of letting things like this unfold the way they were designed, and every advocate is going to get in there and want a piece of it, and special treatment for their own disease. They will tear it down so much it's just another government agency that does nothing. Not that I'm cynical or anything.",0,1,0.13505650745146547
835,38,4,1,11,2015,2015-11-01,"Hearing I was going to have to go back on a harsh chemo made me nervous. I'm not in good shape at all. When I started all this funny business years ago, I had the strength to manage it. Now, I wonder how much more I can do. During my period of remission, I did try to regain my health. I took the exercise class from Triumph Fitness and spent 3 months improving my balance, my strength, and my energy. (Put Triumph on your donation list, they do great work.) I purchased a smoothie blender from Amazon, got some powdered protein and yogurt and tried to get some calories in. (""Try"" being the operative word.) I didn't quite get to healthy, but I did get to better. At some point though, this disease began crawling through my insides, making progress difficult. Now that I will be starting another chemo, my 8th, I feel a new urgency to get my wrecked body stronger. Chemo, my friends, is harder the longer you are on it. Those long-ago first six rounds seem like the healthy days gone by compared to what it is to start your 300th infusion. I know I need to take some walks, get some natural sunlight, and not let myself deteriorate too much. It's too easy to sit in a chair and turn on the TV, especially when one is in pain. They don't seem to make any new episodes of Hoarders anyway. Darn. When LifeTrak contacted me to ask if I would review one of their exercise watches, I was intrigued. The timing was perfect, how did they know? My first thought was ""can I even wear a watch?"" My wrist is only 5 inches around. Thoughtfully, their bands have holes to the very end, so I agreed to test it. It fit, and I have been wearing it ever since. True, it's not a beautiful chunky bracelet on me; it's a big honking piece of gadgetry that takes over my entire wrist and half my arm. While a large watch looks stylish on many women, not so much on me, and yet I like it so much I'm keeping it on. They let me select any watch I wanted, so after looking at them all, I selected one that would track the amount of light I get, the Fitness Tracker Brite 450. Why that one? Those of you with cancer have likely heard the idea that Vitamin D deficiency is being considered as a risk factor in various types of cancer, including breast. While that cat is out of the bag, having a fitness monitor that could track the amount of light I receive would be very helpful for me since I am lacking Vitamin D. Whether D affects cancer relapse is unknown, but it cannot hurt you to get Vitamin D naturally, and maybe in the future we'll discover that it could help prevent a recurrence. I have always been a bit of a light nut, owning a 10,000 Lux light box for energy and a sunrise light to help me wake. It's true that light affects other aspects of our health, including metabolism and mood. This watch not only tracks ambient light, it tracks blue light, which can interfere with your sleeping pattern. (This is why it's suggested you not do screen time before sleep.) So it jumped right out at me as being something I could use. Although I have a deep deficiency in Vitamin D levels and must supplement, I still think it's important to get natural light and allow it to synthesize on your skin. Interestingly, there is an increase in the number of children who are presenting with a lack of Vitamin D, likely due to overuse of sunscreen, poor diets, and sedentary lifestyles. There is no doubt that getting sunlight is a critical part of our health. Light aside, the watch also tracks your sleep, your heart rate, and your physical activity (expressed in calories). It is a step counter, of course, but you can set it for different activity levels. (Mine is set the lowest.) Tracking your heart-rate is as simple as a push of the button. It syncs easily to your phone (in my case, an iPhone) and gives you a nice layout of your data, and it works with the iPhone Health app. Awesomely, you also get phone notifications - telling you if there is a text message, somebody pins something of yours, a phone call - whatever notifications you have set just pops up on your watch screen. I set it up easily - like most watches, you do it with a combination of button pushes. It starts by asking your age, your weight, and then you set your goals. How many steps a day, how much morning and evening light you want to get, how much sleep, etc. It will alarm you and remind you through the day to do the things you suggested. Download the LifeTrak app for your phone, sync it and there you go. You get information like this: Well, hopefully, you will get better information than I do. By clicking on these you can go deeper into each screen to track progress, and you can see weekly and monthly data. When you look at the app, it gives you health tips. My very first one said I was more likely to die of heart disease than breast cancer. No kidding! That made me laugh. I love the intelligent wake up. You set the alarm for the time you want to wake up, and the period in which you want it to start. For example, I have mine set for 20 minutes before I actually want to wake up. Then the watch uses your own historical data and your movements to wake you up anytime starting within that 20 minute period. It tries to alert you when you are not in a deep sleep, which makes waking up so much easier. I haven't experienced any problems and I've been wearing it steadily for two weeks. The only negative is that it is very dim. The backlight doesn't brighten it enough. You really need to be in good lighting to see it well. But that little problem actually helps me with my goal - go outside! Get near a window! The only other problem was I told my oldest son I'd give it to him if I didn't need it after I'd had it long enough to review it. And now he doesn't get it. You can purchase the LifeTrak exercise watch at their store or on Amazon. I really didn't think I'd care for it as much as I do. It does help keep track of our fitness levels and the light thing is crucial to me. I advise those who are recovering from cancer treatment come up with some sort of plan for the future. Most people are understandably afraid of relapse, and while it is a possibility, worrying about it before it happens takes away from living your life now. Many use cancer as a wake-up call for moving into a healthier lifestyle, and you can too. You know better than most how important health is, and how suddenly it can be taken. Once the intensity of treatment ends and you are easing yourself back into normality, a health plan is crucial, and I think a fitness monitor such as the LifeTrak watch can play an important role in keeping your goals in the forefront and seeing improvement. And, because I don't review items without being able to give one to you - one of my fabulous readers is going to win one! The holidays are coming, and this is a good way to help you or somebody in your family get a good start back to fitness or continue with fitness goals. The winner will be getting the exact model I have - the LifeTrack Brite 450 with a black band (grey inside). Good for both male or female. To enter, click and follow the instructions. I'm sorry, but this contest is only open to US residents. Good luck!",0,1,0.21347885328101143
836,38,5,23,11,2015,2015-11-23,"In some people, cancer causes ""loss of appetite."" Only it's not really a mere loss of appetite; there is no good medical description for what really happens. I know because I'm experiencing it. From a site about this topic: ""..the inability to eat and the associated weight loss often causes conflicts within relationships. In fact, nutrition and nutritional status have a central position in the concept of health and wellbeing for many patients and care givers, and weight loss and inadequate nutritional intake can lead to anxiety and a feeling of hopelessness. Available data suggest that patients and their families view poor appetite as the most distressing symptom they encounter during cancer treatment."" And what happens is that family members, not knowing what else to do, nag us to eat. Cancer patients aren't alone in this ""loss of appetite."" Liver disease, HIV, heart failure, kidney disease and others can cause it, either temporarily or permanently. But since I write about cancer, I have to say that it is very common in people with advanced cancer, especially those of us who have it in our GI area. No, not everybody has it, but plenty do. There is a formal name for this: ""anorexia-cachexia syndrome."" It's why you picture a dying cancer patient as wraith-like; like Steve Jobs. Let's just say that at a certain point in the disease, most of us are not really worried about keeping our figures. I know that it is very disturbing for family to watch their loved one wither away, especially when you think that it's because they don't eat. You are puzzled when they turn down food or only eat a few bites and won't can't do anymore. You may even get angry. ""Don't you know you have to eat?"" you say, exasperated. You may believe that they are being ornery, or don't realize how little their food intake is, or are just not hungry and should eat anyway. ""If they will just eat,"" you think ""maybe they could get better."" So you nag. You believe that it is within the sick person's control - mind over matter. Force it down. Just eat, dammit! I understand this thinking all too well. My mother died of cirrhosis of the liver and she barely ate for the last years of her life. She was about 70 pounds at her death, and she was normally in the 130s. Naturally, this caused incredible distress for my father. My parents were never big eaters, but after they retired and moved to Nevada, they did enjoy going out to lunch every day and eating a sandwich or steak. They rotated restaurants; my dad, the big flirt, always chatting up the waitresses. At some point, my mother stopped ordering food. (Although not wine.) Because it was their only meal of the day, she began losing weight. And more weight. At that time, she didn't have a diagnosis of anything wrong, so nobody understood what was happening or why. In frustration, my Dad asked me to come and cook for them, thinking home-cooked meals might tempt her. Being a dutiful daughter, I took a week off work (this was ironically just a couple weeks before I was diagnosed with cancer.) I spent time cooking all of my mother's favorite meals, freezing leftovers so at least my Dad would have something to eat. I knew it would do no good for my mother - but I, too, believed it was because she was stubborn. I thought she lost her appetite because of her drinking but could eat if she wanted to. Knowing she wouldn't listen to her daughter, I didn't spend any time trying to talk her into it. But my dad was hopeful my cooking would help, and during her afternoon naps, he would tell me about his worry. The rest of my family spent time literally begging her to eat. He and the rest of the family told her how much her body needed food, encouraged her to ""take one bite,"" and all the rest of the things she, as a smart woman, already knew. Her only response to these many entreaties was to shrug, light a cigarette and pour a scotch. Now we know she was sick from end-stage liver disease. And now, sick from end-stage cancer, I see the other side of this food story. The only difference for me is I don't get any calories from alcohol. My mother didn't have the capability of explaining what was going on with her - but I do. And not only do family members need to hear it, medical professionals do too. First, you must understand that while they call it is a ""loss of appetite,"" it is much bigger than that. You may be able to eat when you aren't hungry - we can't. This problem of being unable to eat is not a matter of will-power, nor is it in our control. It is a symptom, a complication of our disease, same as a runny nose caused by a cold. Pleading with us to eat is like begging somebody with a cold to stop their nose from running. The patient wants it to stop too - but it cannot happen, they have no control. They aren't being stubborn or willful because they cannot command their body to stop making mucus. They literally, physically, cannot. This is the same thing. While the reasons for this syndrome are not well-understood, scientists do know that it is a metabolic problem. There is even a name for it - cancer anorexia cachexia. I'm not going to be able to explain this well, but you can search for it if interested. Very simply, tumors release destructive proteins which tell cells to produce an inflammatory reaction which can cause a loss of appetite.These proteins can also cause muscle atrophy and can be the cause of altered taste changes, among many other problems. It's a whole metabolic cascade response caused by end-stage cancer: ""..anorexia describes loss of appetite and/or an aversion to food. The term “cachexia” refers to a loss of body mass, including lean body mass and fat, in the setting of a disease state, in this case cancer. - See more at: http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management/anorexia-and-cachexia#sthash.Hw0aa190.dpuf "" ""Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment”. [Fearon, Lancet Oncol 2011]"" It is physical, and it isn't a problem somebody can mentally talk themselves out of. Not even me. I do have a loss of appetite although that phrase does not encompass all that I experience. Appetite isn't the same as hunger. I wouldn't say I never feel hungry because there are times when I am hungry, although not the way I used to be. People think I should smoke weed, or get some prescription drug that will increase my appetite, but being hungry is really not the problem; it's what happens after I'm hungry that is the problem. Eating is the problem. I have no desire for food, even if I get hungry. In fact, food is repulsive to me. Just the idea of eating makes me uncomfortable. I used to be a foodie, and cooking was a hobby. I enjoyed watching TV shows about food and trying new recipes. My husband and I thought when we were retired we'd eat out regularly, trying new restaurants, travelling to places like Chez Panisse. My town has a good food scene. I used to know when restaurants opened, and I intended to sample it all. Now, food is revolting. Even when I do feel hungry, the idea of eating grosses me out. As my husband shared, he does the cooking now, and he frequently asks me what I want to eat, because of course, he wants me to like what he cooks. But the answer is nothing! I don't want to eat, it is unpleasant to even think about it. Angering even. Food is no longer desirable. It's an intense annoyance. The things I used to like don't taste good to me anymore, and not only that, the texture seems weird. I used to love eggs - I could eat eggs every day. Loved them fried, scrambled, poached, hard/soft boiled, on salads and pasta, you name it. Now they taste sour. And the texture is nasty. A scrambled egg seems to have a gritty texture, like it's filled with sand. An egg over-easy, the way I loved them, is like oil. I can't even remember what I liked about them. Anything creamy seems oily to me which is why I can't tolerate those Boost type drinks. I physically react to food that I no longer like - just a few swallows and my throat closes and I wretch from disgust. Giving me food is like putting a plate of crickets in front of me and expecting me to eat it. I think of the crunchy legs in my teeth and shiver. Just....no. There are still foods I like. Fresh fruit. Oddly, I like sweets now, candy, like a little kid. My husband buys whoppers for me. I can't eat an entire candy bar but a couple whoppers give me the sweet I want without hurting my stomach too much. Hurting: I feel very full, very fast. I eat three grapes (or whoppers) and I feel like I ate a Thanksgiving meal. Fruit hurts for a lesser amount of time, which is why I like it. If I eat a regular meal, say a piece of chicken, potatoes and vegetable, it's like I ate a full Thanksgiving meal - twice - and added four pieces of pie. My stomach hurts from the cancer anyway and adding this fullness to it becomes overwhelming. Feeling full has always been uncomfortable for me; it's probably why I've always been thin. But now being full is more than uncomfortable. It's pain, real pain, true pain, not happy ""Oh I overate, groan pain."" I feel like I've been punched in the stomach and my meal consisted of knives stabbing me from the inside. It feels like my stomach is full of rocks, and I'm weighed down, and each movement causes pain. And it can take 8-10 hours to digest and go away. Because it's hard to stand for a long time, and my feelings about food have turned unpleasant, my husband does all the cooking. I do eat a meal at dinner. Not a big meal, but a meal. My husband needs to eat and by dinnertime, that's when I also try to eat. But when my body says to stop eating, I have to or I get sick and feel pain. Not nauseated sick, just painful, repellent sick. I'll wretch if I overdo it. I had a big meal the other night - a babyback rib and a 1/4 cups of greens. To me, these days, that is a lot of food. I'd be shocked if I ate 500 calories a day. And then, after dinner, the pain comes and can hurt for hours. Still, I get as much in as I can. That IS forcing myself because my desire and inclination is to never eat again. But I know it's not much. My body simply rejects food and it's beyond my control. I weigh 89 pounds now. That really isn't as terrible as you might think, because my normal weight hovers at around 100. I think I was 104 when diagnosed. My highest weight ever not pregnant was 107 so I'm really not as thin as it sounds. But just 2 months ago, I was 95 and it had been steady at 96-97 for a year, so we are going in the wrong direction. I don't eat much but it's the same amount I ate 3 months ago. So the cancer is clearly changing my metabolism. I am starting to look pretty skeletony. My hip bones show, my rear end is completely gone and my jeans, a Size 00, hang on me. Being this thin is uncomfortable - sitting hurts, sleeping can hurt, bones clang against bones. I sit reading with my knees up and my silly husband likes to come up and kiss my knee. I'm afraid he's going to get a cut. I am trying to describe this for those of you who are living or caring for somebody with end stage cancer (or other disease) and who is starting to experience this problem. I want you to understand that it isn't their fault. And it isn't YOUR fault. You can't make somebody eat, and here is what you must understand - they can't make themselves eat. It's distressing for all involved. I know it is hard for you to watch. You want so badly for us to get healthy and survive longer and we know that. Remember, it is hard for us too. We want all that too, and have the added burden of knowing our loved ones don't understand, and think we aren't trying hard enough. No cancer patient should feel upset at themselves or feel like they are disappointing others for having a disease. And this is a symptom of a disease. When you nag us about eating, you make us know we are hurting you. We feel guilty that we can't do something that seems so easy. Many cancer patients do not even understand this is part of the disease process and not in our control, so we are upset at ourselves, and think we are doing cancer wrong. So if you are living with an anorexic cancer patient - and you understand now that suggesting/nagging/begging us to eat won't be effective - does that mean you can do nothing? No. I have suggestions. This is getting long, so I will write a part II about what is, in my opinion only, the best thing to do for us.",0,-1,-0.016451948867203116
837,38,6,29,11,2015,2015-11-29,"So, your loved one has advanced cancer, is not eating, and you want to help. First, please read part one. You must understand that what you think is a loss of appetite is more than that - it's a true physical inability to eat. It's a symptom and a complication of disease and not something we control with willpower. No matter how much you beg and cajole, eating regular, normal meals is a medical impossibility and will only cause more stress. You might as well be begging somebody with a broken femur to get up and run a marathon. I also want to make clear that I am not talking about the common loss of appetite that happens in an early stage cancer patient due to chemo, surgery, or as a medication side effect. Depression and some medications can also cause a lack of appetite in early stage cancer patients, and so appropriate diagnosis and medications may help. Any lack of appetite should be discussed with a doctor. I am talking about something very different. I am talking about what happens to an end-stage, terminal cancer patient - anorexia-cachexia. This is a wasting condition where muscle is lost, metabolism is revved up yet food desire disappears, and it happens because of their disease, not because of treatment. Those who have cancer anorexia-cachexia experience it even when we are off treatment. Mine started before I started the new chemo, when the cancer (unbeknownst to me) began spreading again but when I was on the same therapy I'd been on for 2 years. So what can you, as a caretaker, do to help? I will tell you what has worked for my home, and you can adapt this for yourself. Communication: Don't ask the patient to make food decisions. I do not want to be asked what I feel like eating, because the answer is nothing. My husband used to say ""What do you want for breakfast?"" or ""Do you want eggs or pancakes?"" ""Do you want soup for dinner?"" I truly cannot answer that question because I don't want anything. And not only do I not want it - it makes me angry to think about. Angry, frustrated, annoyed....You might as well ask me, ""Do you want to be stabbed in the lung or the liver?"" Neither! I truly cannot make food decisions at this point. I told my husband that he is not allowed to talk to me about food. Bring me food or don't, cook or don't, but leave me out of it. I won't acknowledge that question and he has stopped. All decisions about food are his. I think I eat a tiny bit more since he stopped asking me and just started giving it to me. Shop: Put yourself in the role of decision maker. For husbands, or at least for mine, this may be something they aren't used to. I shopped and I cooked. Now I am beyond shopping for food. I used to go to Whole Foods and buy all the things I'd love in the hopes I could eat, yet it would rot in the fridge. Now, I don't even want to see it, my stomach roils just thinking about food. So, take it upon yourself to shop for your loved one. Try to keep the things you know she'll eat on hand, and keep the things you hope she'll eat around too. Don't worry so much about nutrition as much as intake. If all I can eat is cake or 3 musketeers mini-bars, well, make sure I have cake or candy in the house. Don't substitute what you believe is healthy - it's not going to be healthy if we can't tolerate eating it. Take Control of Food for your Loved One: Bring foods every few hours. While I won't make a food decision, I also don't want to be on my own with food intake because frankly, I wouldn't eat. At all. I know mentally I have to eat but cannot tolerate the thought or the pain that comes later, and most food sounds disgusting now - so I need help. Despite the fact that everything but candy sounds awful, if something is put in front of me at dinner, I sometimes eat it. I have no appetite and won't ask for it, but if a cup of hot soup, or a cup of tea and cookie is placed in front of me on a cold day, I might sip it. Maybe just a sip ... but it's something. If a tiny plate of fruit and cheese is placed in front of me at lunch, I might nibble at it. (Tiny being a few grapes and a tablespoon of cheese). I certainly won't get it myself and if you ask me if I want it, the answer is an unequivocal no. If it magically appears without questions or expectations, maybe I'd try. Maybe I wouldn't. But it is better than talking about it, which I am certain to not respond to. Size Counts. Food hurts, we don't want to see it. Don't put a big bowl or plate of anything in front of me. It hurts to even look at it. Keep it small. Light and airy. I don't know why looking at a big plate of food bothers me but it does. Notice taste changes. Cachexia can cause things to taste weird. Keep our new likes in mind. If I can't stand garlic anymore, don't put it in anything we share, even if you like it and even if you know I used to love it. Now, it's different. I can no longer tolerate onions, garlic, or any kind of intense flavor but used to put them in everything. I still like salty food. I like popcorn with no butter. And sugar is something I never cared about but now like. Taste changes can make things we enjoyed formerly undesirable. So pay attention and make sure those things we now like are on hand. Choices: Provide tasty foods. My husband is a truly terrible cook. (Sorry hon.) I finally tried a food subscription service, where meals are delivered with recipes. It's expensive and I hate that I have to pay for that with a kid in college - but that said, I eat a bit of it. There are several of these services. They give you choices of meals weekly and deliver them to your home. The right amounts are sent with recipes, and my husband just has to put the meals together. They are creative and flavorful, and I like them. That doesn't mean I can eat a full meal, but when I taste something that is good, I can usually eat a few bites. When it was him cooking on his own, I had no incentive at all to eat. Taste still counts, even if we like fewer and fewer things. Diet: The time to worry about nutrition is over. Nutrition is important when you are an early stage cancer patient regaining your health. Everyone should eat well. But when we are this sick, and hardly able to eat, getting calories in is more important than a balanced diet. My oncologist says any calorie is a good one. Your ideas about perfect nutrition have to go out the window at this late stage. That doesn't mean you shouldn't give a cancer patient nutritious foods, but only if they will eat it. Give little balanced nutritious meals through the day and see what the patient eats. If it's pretzels and grapes, that is better than nothing. Nagging: Don't. We know. We really do. If you get the urge to nag, do something instead. Put small amounts of food in front of a cancer patient without asking a couple times a day - and take it away whether it's eaten or not, and say nothing. Ignore your feelings of upset, time/money wasted or rejection if it isn't eaten. What's the ultimate goal? Your feelings, or helping a cancer patient with a symptom? Know you tried. You showed your love. It's better than nagging. If you want to help, this is what help looks like. If you don't, that is fine, understandable really - nobody really wants to be responsible for another adult's food intake. Just don't put it back on us, which is what nagging does. Remember, you can't force us to eat. You can't talk us into it. All you can do is tempt us and make it easier. If we can't do it, you did your best. Not only did you try to help us, you did it leaving our dignity intact. You can remember that with pride. Understanding. Truly learn this isn't within our control. Imagine, if you were forced to eat something disgusting and got punched in the stomach with every bite which then caused hours of pain - eventually you wouldn't want to eat either, even if you had an appetite. When you have no desire for food and a food revulsion, when your body doesn't want food any more and with each bite there is real pain - it doesn't take long to learn to stop. Try to understand how hard it is for us. Try to understand that it is out of our control, and that it is our bodies doing this and not our minds. Bottom line: If one of the symptoms of having a disease is a runny nose, hand us a tissue, don't try to convince us to make our nose stop running. Do remember, it's nobody's fault. You can't talk us out of pain, you can only bring us a pill. You can't make us not tired, you can only let us rest. You also can't make us able to eat, you can only provide foods and leave the rest to us. We want comfort, love and acceptance, especially at the end, not fights about food.

Like everything with cancer, there is a continuum. I've already experienced it for longer than 3 months. Most people do stop eating as part of the dying process no matter what disease they have, and it is a sign that time is short. But others can go this way for a while, my mother did for about 2 years (she did, of course, get quite a lot of calories from alcohol). I don't think I'm within 3 months of death although my next scan will be telling. It is becoming clear that this disease is going to win for sure and I will not be one of those who gets ten years.

838,38,7,29,2,2016,2016-02-29,"This month, I have been fortunate enough to have had visits from my oldest dearest friend, as well as my sister. Many of you canceristas and metsters are lucky enough to have loved ones who visit. But tell me, do they always behave the way the way you wish they would? Of course their intentions might be good, but their thoughtlessness sometimes shows. Insensitive behavior happens most often when we don't appear sick. When we look normal, people forget our illness, especially those of us with cancer, which so many equate with hair loss. If you aren't bedridden and bald, you can't be unwell, right? Wrong. Sick, even real, debilitating sick, can be quiet, invisible and subtle. In coming up with a way to keep my vivacious friend busy and do an activity together, I came up with this video. Not only was it a fun activity for friends to do, it will hopefully remind those who visit a chronically ill person what to remember during their time together. No matter the illness, the best way to be supportive is to take your cue from the sick person, and don't put pressure on them ...about anything. There are many more ""what not to do"" items that we missed, and we wanted the video short, so please feel free to add your peeve in the comments, or on facebook. As you can see, we both missed our calling as actors. I really do think a designer should consider sending me an Oscar-worthy dress, shoes and jewelry, don't you?

839,38,8,14,11,2015,2015-11-14,"November is National Family Caregivers' Month. My husband is the one who does most of what we know as ""caregiving."" Recently, I asked him, ""what is it like? What does being a caregiver mean to you?"" Our plans for life and dreams for the future have certainly ...changed. Things we thought we'd be doing, we will never get to do. Tasks that I did happily and without thinking have fallen to him. I don't think he thought of himself as a caregiver, and I do my best to not have my disease physically impact my family more than it must, but of course, somebody has to take up the slack. I wondered what he thought about it. I was delighted to see that he wrote down what he had been thinking for the blog. And then, of course, it made me sad. Below is what he said. True Companions “The Caregiver” Pre C Ann and I were married relatively late in life; I was 47 and she was 36. We each had children, and were a family of five right away. We bought a house and moved in together five months before our wedding, which we held in our backyard, surrounded by family and friends. We were very happy. With a backyard wedding, you can do things the way you want, and one of the things I've always liked to do is put together sets of music. They would be called “Playlists” today, but we just called them “tapes”. The first song on the tape was used as a backyard wedding march. It was a song called “True Companion” by Marc Cohn, and was a song we both liked very much. Its opening verse is about a young couple beginning their lives together. My daughter started the playback when Ann and her father started to walk, and ended it when she arrived where I was standing, at the completion of that verse. But there is more to “True Companion” than that verse. It goes on to talk about the companions as they grow older. When the years have done irreparable harm I can see us walking arm in arm. Just like that couple on the corner do Girl, I will always be in love with you. I thought about how that might go for us. Being more than 10 years older than Ann, and given that women, on average, live four years longer than men, I knew that there was a distinct possibility that Ann would outlive me, and I did all my financial planning to make sure I would leave Ann in a good living situation when my end came. Oh, sure, I'm a healthy guy, and my parents lived into their mid-80s, but 14 years is a big spot. Two-plus years later it became even more critical when our youngest son was born. But, emotionally, I just knew that we would get to those golden years when it was just us, and we could do the things we had always wanted to do as Senior Citizens. “What the heck is that?” Most of you have read Ann's early blog posts, so I thought I'd borrow her opening question. But first, a little background on me. I rarely show emotions, especially negative ones. My maternal grandparents were English immigrants and, through my mother, “stiff upper lip” was part of my makeup. I also consider myself a problem solver. So, rating people on the Kirk/Spock Continuum, I am way Spock. Those of you more to the Kirk side will have different reactions than the ones I'll be describing here. Anyway, when Ann came out of the bathroom and showed me the lump she had discovered in her breast, my thoughts went to what else it could be besides cancer. Not denial, really, just trying to identify other, less ominous, possibilities. Like a benign cyst, for instance. I'd had those. Ann is one of those people who wants to do everything herself, especially medical appointments. And the appointment to find out what the lump was was no exception. I was at lunch, walking through Capitol Park, when she called me with the results. In a calmer tone than you might expect she told me that her lump was cancer and she had a referral to a surgeon. I tried to remain calm as well, and told her that I would be going with her to see the surgeon. She didn't object. The appointment with “Rockstar Raja” went well. He said that Ann's tumor was Stage 2 and that the combination of a mastectomy and follow up chemo was likely to result in a cure. That made me feel a little better. He also referred Ann to a plastic surgeon to work on her reconstruction, which surprised me a little. Both surgeons would do surgery at the same time; Dr. Raja first, and then the plastic surgeon. “No oncologist?”, I asked. No, he said, those come later. Surgery #1 The mastectomy and initial plastic surgical procedures went well, and Dr. Raja reported that the margins were clear. So my immediate reaction was one of relief. The cancer was in the bio-waste bin and chemo would be a precaution, to make sure it didn't reappear. Looking back, that was terribly naive, but I'm a “glass half full” kind of guy, and that's what I thought. You catch it early you live, right? A digression: I am writing this because several people have asked me what it is like to be a “caregiver” for my wife. I have a hard time with that question, because I don't really consider myself a caregiver. My wife has physical problems, and I need to help her with them. A very Spock way to think, I suppose, but that's me. Ann is a very strong woman emotionally (as you can tell from reading her blog), but there would be times when I needed to do more in the way of emotional support, and I usually was a couple of counts late on those. I wish I had been better. After the mastectomy Ann had trouble moving, and lifting and driving were out of the question. So I took her everywhere she needed to go, which were mainly medical appointments, since she really didn't want to go anywhere else. Post Op care was mostly provided by the plastic surgeon, and I learned how to deal with emptying the drain bag that goes with surgeries involving the lymphatic system. I took her to meet the oncologist, and to the first few chemo sessions. But as soon as Ann was able to drive I quit going to those, at her request. Surgery #2 Ann had very simple, and clear, requirements for her breast reconstruction: she wanted to look good in clothes. But the process turned out to be much more problematic than the mastectomy had been. Although we didn't know it at the time, the plastic surgeon was dealing with his own health issues. He scheduled the first procedure, and then canceled it at the last minute. I took Ann to the hospital, and she even “gowned up” before the nurse came in after a long wait and told us that the surgery had been canceled. Something about the hospital not having the right kind of stuff on hand. So Ann put her clothes back on and we left. Emotion on that particular day,shared by both Ann and I, was anger, with a side of frustration. As those of you who have been through it already know, breast reconstruction is not the same as a Boob Job. Both involve the same body part (sort of), and both are done by plastic surgeons, but the requirements, issues, and results are very different. In Ann's case, one of the results was a frozen shoulder. She was unable to raise her arm more than a foot or so from her side. It made things like getting dressed difficult and painful. It was also semi-permanent. While it has improved some over the ensuing years, her shoulder is still not right. It sent a very important message to us – even if you beat cancer, you will never truly be the same after its treatment. Mets Ann didn't beat cancer after all. She was left with more than a missing breast and a frozen shoulder; she was left with cancer. Cancer treatment, in addition to causing a number of health issues, like hair loss, slipping blood counts, and a host of other conditions, doesn't go on forever in most early stage patients. Most eventually become “No Evidence of Disease” (NED). At that point, treatment stops, and breath holding starts. While you are happy to be out of treatment, and on the road to good (or at least pretty good) health, there is a background concern that the cancer may come back. And, within a few months, it did. We were first surprised, and then devastated. We'd seen the movie on the development of Herceptin, and it seemed like it would lead to a cure. But it didn't. I didn't go with Ann to see the oncologist when he discussed the new scan results with her. He told her that the cancer had spread to her liver. But he put a positive spin on it; the cancer was only in her liver, and there were only two tumors. He ordered up new chemo and the treatment process was on again. Likely for good this time. The average survival for a Stage 4 patient with Ann's kind of cancer is two years. And the Two Years to Live clock had started. Surgery #3 Ann likes her oncologist very much, and she has enough trust in him to be able to take bad news with an “OK, now what do we do?” attitude. He was aware of a surgeon in San Francisco who was doing liver resections on Stage 4 cancer patients with good results, including long periods of remission. (Nobody says “cure” for a Metster; a long period of remission is as good as it gets.) He referred us to that surgeon, who agreed to see Ann as a possible surgical candidate. So off to San Francisco we went. The trip is only about 90 miles, but involves some of the worst traffic this side of downtown LA. Hard to remain positive when you are inching toward the Bay Bridge. Anyway, when we got in to see the surgeon he said he needed more scans before agreeing to do the surgery. (SF scans are apparently better than Sac scans. Who knew?) After the scans, and another trip (or two; I don't remember) to San Francisco, he agreed to do the surgery, at UC San Francisco. He would remove half of Ann's liver, containing the larger of her two tumors, and then try to remove just the tumor from the other side. At various times, our sons, daughter, Ann's sister, and I were all in SF doing whatever we could to send positive vibes, for both the surgery and the post-op recovery period. The surgery mostly went well, but the smaller tumor was too deeply embedded in her liver and couldn't be removed, so he ablated (burned) it. The Two Years to Live clock had been reset. Abdominal surgery is rough, and we had another 90 mile trip to navigate. We propped up Ann with pillows the best we could, and started out. I've never been so aware of my driving in my life, as a tried to avoid anything that might make the car bounce. I must have done pretty well, because Ann slept most of the way. C. Diff The recovery from the liver resection was going well, and things were getting back to the new normal (not to be confused with the old normal). We even held Thanksgiving at our house, as usual. But what I didn't know was that Ann had begun to have diarrhea. It got worse, and she told me what was going on, sending me to the store for Imodium. And then it got much worse, to the point where on the evening of Black Friday, she said it was time to go to the ER. When the ER doctors heard about the recent liver resection and hospital stay they had a pretty good idea about what it was – a serious bacterial infection, C. Diff. Tests showed they were right, and they admitted Ann to the hospital, and straight to the ICU, with full protective clothing for everyone involved. Ann not only had C-Diff, she had sepsis. Visits to the ICU by people who didn't have to be there were discouraged and, with a son at home, I mostly stayed away, visiting the ICU only once. After a couple of days in the ICU, they moved her into a regular room, but still with all the Hazmat conditions. I was told to thoroughly clean everywhere she had been at home, because the C. Diff bacteria can live for an extended period of time outside the body, and is not only dangerous to the person with the infection, but to everyone who has come in contact with the places she had been. So I washed all the linen and towels in hot water and bleach, and cleaned the two bathrooms she had used with bleach as well. I also bought disposable hand towels, to reduce the risk of infection even further. I am not, by nature, a germophobe, and generally consider clutter to be a bigger problem than dirt, but not this time. This was serious, not only to Ann but to our son and me. Early tests showed only partial success in beating back the infection. She was still at risk of having the infection spread again throughout her body, almost certainly killing her. To keep that from happening, the alternative would be to remove her colon, a procedure with a 80% mortality rate. Fortunately, her test numbers improved with treatment and she got to keep her colon, and I got to keep my wife. But it was a very scary few days. As it turns out, the scaryness for me was just beginning. They discharged Ann from the hospital mid-day Friday, a week after we went to the ER. She wasn't cured, by any means, but the treatment, a very powerful antibiotic, was working and could be continued at home. They gave her a prescription for the antibiotic and, after bringing Ann home and getting her comfortable, I took it to our regular pharmacy. And that's when things got scary for me. The pharmacy didn't have the medicine in stock, and wouldn't be able to get any until Monday at the earliest. Monday seemed to me to be so far in the future that it would never come. And, for Ann, it might not have. An incompletely cured infection is worse than an untreated one, and I had a very real fear that my wife would be dead, or having her colon removed, by Monday. The pharmacy called others in our area, with the same result – nothing until at least Monday. So I called the hospital to see if they could give us enough to get Ann through the weekend. They said that they couldn't. Ann had left the hospital with some open but unused product, enough for one more dose. But that was it; they were not allowed to dispense drugs to outpatients. (Whose stupid rule was that?! ) They did give me a suggestion,though – to call pharmacies associated with other hospitals, figuring they would be the best bet to have some. So I did that, with my first call to the pharmacy associated with the downtown hospital where Ann had her first surgery. They had some, and said I could get it right away. Whew! A little while later, a co-worker asked me how Ann was doing. I said she was improving daily, and then shared some other thoughts with her. I said that with metastatic cancer you knew that, barring some other calamity, you would die from cancer. But it wouldn't be today, or this month, or, quite possibly, this year. So you could establish a regular way of doing things for the near future. But with C. Diff the situation was different. It was entirely possible, almost likely, that you would die today. Or tomorrow. It is a very different, and overwhelming situation. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Meals Up to this point, this rambling narrative has been in chronological order, and will return to that in the next section. But, since the original question was about being a caregiver, I want to work this in. In our Pre C, life Ann did pretty much all the cooking, and continued doing that whenever she felt up to it. I did some BBQ in the summer, but even then Ann did the rest of the meal. When she didn't feel well I would “cook”things like Hamburger Helper or other easy to fix meals. But at this point, her appetite was near normal, and she grew tired of what I was preparing very quickly. She asked me to get a cookbook and see if I could put something better on the table. So, absent even things like knife skills, I started down the road of being the chief meal preparer. Today, I do pretty much all the cooking. The need to have good food on the table has become even more critical lately, as Ann has lost her ability to enjoy most food. A cancer-induced anorexia, if you will. So it's up to me to get her to eat, and not lose any more weight. I do my best. Remission; Retirement Eventually, a scan showed that the remaining tumor after the liver resection, the one that had been ablated, had become active again. Ann's oncologist recommended a radiation treatment called the “Gamma Knife”, along with some new drugs in her once every 3 weeks infusions. She agreed to the plan and had the Gamma Knife procedure. The Two Years to Live clock was, once again, reset. But it got better. The treatment had worked so well that a subsequent scan showed that Ann was, for the first time in a long time, NED. Remission! The Two Years to Live clock was on hold! At first, it seemed hard to believe. But as the months rolled by, this NED thing had become the new normal. If only Ann had felt better. Even without active cancer, Ann really didn't feel well, a major disappointment. Meanwhile, my situation at work was changing. When our son was born, the Math major in me quickly figured out that I would need to work until 70 to get him through college. As I said before, I'm a healthy guy who actually enjoyed his job, so setting my sights on 70 wasn't that hard. For one thing, it would improve my retirement income. The State Of California retirement system gives a number of options for how to take your money in retirement, but they mainly come down to getting a larger amount until you die, or a smaller amount until you and your wife both die. As I said in the opening section, for me the choice was easy, given our age difference. But the choice didn't need to be made until retirement, and when Ann was diagnosed Stage 4 my retirement date, in 2017, seemed impossibly far away for her. But I didn't make it to 2017. In 2012, upon the retirement of my boss, I was named Acting CIO at my department. Those assignments are supposed to last no more than a year, but mine drug on for 20 months, until they finally hired a new permanent CIO, returning me to my old job, in May 2013. I was fine with that. My new boss? Not so much. For whatever reason, she clearly wanted me gone. And, since I was in an “at will” position, she could demote me at any time, with only 20 days notice. I had almost a year of vacation time on the books, and to keep it from losing value I would have to have taken it as a lump sum payment within the 20 days. More income (good), but more taxes (bad). Or I could accept a demotion and use the vacation over the next few years, until my preferred retirement date of 2017. But then I, once again, did the math. With 30 years of service, my retirement benefit would be 75% of my salary. Seems like a big cut. But then I realized that a lot of deductions, like Social Security and Retirement Contributions stop when I retired. So I did some calculations base on Take Home pay, and found that it would only be reduced by $400 a month in retirement. Not too bad. Then I calculated what my take home pay would be if I stayed working but was demoted. It would drop by $1000 a month. Even if I liked my job, which by then I didn't, I wasn't going to pay the State $600 a month for the privilege of working. This was in November 2013. I told my boss that I was going to start “vacationing out”, and retire in September 2014. I was officially unworking, although getting paid as if I were still working. When September 2014 rolled around Ann was still NED. Remission was feeling more and more like the “real normal”, and Ann was, once again, 10+ years younger than me. So the decision was easy; take the reduced amount and provide for my family after I'm gone. Now As Ann and I both knew, but were reluctant to acknowledge, Remission in a Stage 4 cancer patient is temporary, as much as we wish it weren't. A new scan showed that the cancer was once again active, and no longer confined to her liver. The Two Years to Live clock was once again in motion. She has started a new chemo regimen, but it is too early to tell how effective it will be. Also, given that she is in constant pain and the new chemo is making her sick, it's hard to be optimistic. But there may well be more remission in her future, and we can't completely dwell on the present. Just deal with it, and see what comes next. When Ann was first diagnosed Stage 4, she set her sights on seeing our son graduate from high school. She did that. The next big event will be our older son's wedding, six months from now. The oncologist has said she'll make that one, too, and she is helping with the planning and worrying about what to wear, just like any mother of the groom would do. She's not done wanting to live, and I'm in no way tired of my role as caregiver, whatever that means. So we still live in the present. There's no rush in thinking farther ahead than that.",0,1,0.11908514104942672

858,46,1,7,12,2010,2010-12-07,"Today Elizabeth Edwards died from metastatic breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 2004, the day after John Kerry & John Edwards failed to win the 2004 Presidential election. The tumor (which she discovered herself) was the size of a half dollar. It was detected early and the prognosis was good because it had not spread to her body but was contained to her breast. She did a lumpectomy, along with chemotherapy and radiation. In 2006, over a year after her diagnosis, her oncologist said, ""that I had a lot going on in my life . . . but cancer was not one of them"" (taken from The Daily Kos). Then in March 2007, Edwards discovered that her cancer had spread to her ribs, hip, and possibly her lungs. Her oncologist, Dr. Lisa Carey, confirmed that there was no cure for her cancer but that it could be treated and she could live a very full life for the next few years. But that her cancer was terminal. (Here is the link with the original press conference that the Edwards' did at UNC Chapel Hill: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/us/08edwards.html?hp). When I heard that Elizabeth Edwards had passed away this evening I cried. I'd like to be able to tell you that it was purely out of empathy and sympathy -- that my tears were for her young children, as well as her older daughter, her extended family and friends, and even for her estranged husband. But I cried not only in sadness for another woman felled by cancer, but because this particular woman, who lived in Chapel Hill, who had the same disease I have, who shared the same oncologist that I have (yes, Dr. Lisa Carey, is also my oncologist), and who had a similar prognosis, initially, to my prognosis--could be me. There is a 14% chance that what happened to Elizabeth Edwards will happen to me. There is a 14% chance that I will be going to see my oncologist for a follow-up appointment 2 years from now and she will be concerned about a symptom that I am exhibiting and in follow-up tests will tell me that the cancer has returned and it is in my bones or a major organ. There is a 14% chance that just like Elizabeth Edwards, I will be living with stage IV metastatic cancer, trying to figure out how to live with a diagnosis of terminal cancer--how to live with the certain knowledge that my natural life span will be drastically cut short. And there is a 14% chance that like Elizabeth Edwards I will not be here in six years. That I will die from the cancer in my body. I'm scared. Not to the point where I feel paralyzed. And not to the point where I am going to spiral into depression. But in the here and now--on the night that Elizabeth Edwards has died, I'm scared. And I cried not only because a very public woman who had breast cancer died, a woman who lived less than 10 miles down the road from me, but because when I heard that Elizabeth Edwards had died today, I realized that that could be me. We have the same disease with a similar prognosis, were treated in the same facility by the same oncologist. How could I not feel freaked out and wonder if that will be me one day? Which is why I can't say I'm a survivor. I know I've written about this in past posts, but I think Edwards death reminds me that I live with a certain amount of uncertainty. I want to be part of that 86%. I live every day with most of me believing that I will be part of that 86%. But then there are days, like today, where a shadow is cast, and I am reminded that there are the 14% of people who don't survive this disease. The last thing I'll say, though, is that as selfish as part of my tears were, I do mourn Elizabeth Edwards death. Because I think a lot of what she said and did regarding her cancer diagnosis was exemplary and provide me with a model for how I want to approach my own future. In countless interviews after her 2007 cancer relapse, she reiterated that everybody has to die; in her case, she now knows what she's going to die from. She also said that what she wants to show people isn't a woman dying from cancer but a person living with cancer. And that this is the biggest message she has for people with cancer--not to focus on the dying but on the living. And so in honor of Elizabeth Edwards, I'm going to focus on living my life as well as I can. I hope you will too.",0,1,0.09921672998203608
859,46,10,14,1,2011,2011-01-14,"OK, here's a truth. I'm tired. I don't know if I'm more or less tired than I was during chemo and post-surgery. Probably less tired. At least physically it's easier for me to move around. But I *feel* fatigued. On many levels. I think I've downplayed my exhaustion for a few reasons. Primarily I think that I have a hard time accepting that being tired and not having a lot of energy or energy in reserve, which I think is the more accurate description for my condition right now, is part of my new reality. And I think I've been reluctant to accept this because I have been concentrating on being BETTER--on healing and resuming my regular routine and a sense of normalcy. But the truth is, I'm tired a lot. I just don't have the energy that I used to have. And what I mean by this is my life pre-chemo/surgery. My life pre-cancer diagnosis. And my fatigue and exhaustion aren't just physical--it's also mental and emotional. It's a new inability to handle stress in the same way. And a recognition that I need to be as gentle with myself as possible. To really cut myself slack. To not demand too much of myself. In short, I need to learn my limits--my physical limits but also my mental/emotional limits. And this is a hard thing for me to do. I'm normally a very high energy person. And I'm a multitasker who is a perfectionist and who burns the candles at both ends (and sometimes in the middle). I have extraordinarily high (overly high) expectations for myself (and for those close to me, unfortunate at times, I realize) and in general I feel like I should deliver on those expectations. But I can't right now. Pushing myself, something I'm used to doing, is just not an option. I don't have it in me. Case in point: after teaching back-to-back classes yesterday, I canceled my office hours and collapsed on the couch at home, pretty much not getting up until I collapsed in bed (where I promptly fell asleep the minute my head touched my pillow). Normally teaching back-to-back classes and holding office hours would leave me tired, but not ""bone-dead-I'm-going-to-pass-out"" tired. This is my new reality. And it reminds me that teaching takes energy. Emotional and mental energy, in addition to physical energy. I think I forget this because I enjoy teaching and because I've been doing it for so long now that it almost seems like it is second nature to me. But it's work--it takes work to be a good teacher. And I'm not sure how organized or coherent or lively I was yesterday. I know I forgot to share some basic information with my students about their assignments--leading me to follow-up on email. I know that I felt scattered and a bit dis-organized during the first hour of teaching, perhaps a consequence of being out of the classroom for so long. And I know that I was surprised by all of this. Which I shouldn't be. I shouldn't be surprised that teaching is going to be different for me this semester. That my body is different. I am different. And I should be gentle with myself. To not demand too much of myself, especially in these first few weeks back in the classroom. And yet...I'm disappointed. Disappointed in my body for not having more energy. In myself for not being more organized and accomplishing more. Disappointed that I am still healing--that I'm not healed (past tense). It's silly, I know. Healing is something that can't be rushed. And I know that if I were someone else, I would tell me to be more patient and to be gentle and that what I went through was a big deal and I have to learn to limit myself and it's not a failing or an indictment on my character or sense of self. Why do we often become our hardest critics? And is this just because I'm an academic who deconstructs and critiques others for a living? (sigh) Maybe I just need a mantra to get through the next few weeks and months. Be gentle Jen...be gentle Jen. Hopefully I can learn to take my own advice. [Update/Aside: If you saw the post below, you'll see that Matthew and I adopted a new dog, Bella. Unfortunately, we had to return her to her foster mother last week Monday when we realized that Bella had some very aggressive tendencies. Specifically, she tried to attack Bruno 3 times and was also aggressive with our friend's dog, Squirrel. It was a hard decision, but at the end of the day, we feel we made the right choice because we couldn't live with the tension and with the uncertainty of her attacking Bruno. And it's also part of learning my own limits--it wasn't the right time to get another dog because teaching is just about all I can handle right now.]",0,1,0.035263779176150305
860,46,11,2,1,2011,2011-01-02,"It's now the second day of the new year, 2011, and I typically don't do new year's resolutions (seems like a set up for failed expectations) but leaving behind one year for the next does seem to be a chance to look back and reflect, as well as to look ahead with hopes and aspirations. I know I haven't been writing much on this blog--truth be told, the last entry about why I chose not to do reconstruction seemed to be a place for me to pause in terms of my processing about cancer and chemo and surgery. Maybe I also needed a break from writing--which is funny since one could argue that all I've had since May 2010 is a break from writing and working (aside from blog writing that is, well, and some light editing and conference planning activity that I've been doing for the Association for Asian American Studies). When I think about 2010, the last year of the first decade of the 21st century, I realize that it will be marked by my illness and cancer--that I will have spent more days of that year living with the knowledge that I have/had cancer than days not knowing--or to put it another way, that most of 2010 was occupied with being in and out of various doctor's offices (or more accurately, waiting rooms). It'd be easy to say that 2010 was a horrible year and I'm glad it's over. But 2010 will also mark the year I turned 40, and most especially (and most significantly) the year I got married to Matthew. It will also mark the year I turned in my tenure file. And most recently, the year that Matthew and I expanded our family to include Bella--the newest addition to the Grady-Ho household: [We've been debating about a second dog for a while now, but after we returned from our pre-Christmas vacation to Charleston--we decided to look in earnest and we found her through a rescue organization that takes dogs from rural shelters and fosters them in Wake Forest. So far Bruno is tolerating (just barely) his more energetic younger sister--we're hoping that in time, they'll really grow closer] So there have been some important milestone and moments in 2010 that I'll look back on in fondness. And some of them, I must confess, have also been around my cancer diagnosis. Now, I still hold firm to the fact that if I had to do it over again, I would NEVER WANT TO HAVE CANCER OR GO THROUGH CHEMO AND SURGERY. But...I'd be lying if I didn't say that post-cancer diagnosis, I have been nearly overwhelmed and deeply moved by the love and kindness of people in my life. From near strangers to my oldest and closest family members, there have been random acts of kindness and love and support from people that have really humbled me. In particular, all the people who dropped off food--the food gifts were incredible and are most memorable, to me, as both a symbolic and material way for people to express their support/concern/affection. Of course, there are moments that I will never want to relive. That awful feeling in the pit of my stomach upon hearing the initial diagnosis. The worry and concern, the anxiety and fear I could see on people's faces or hear in their voices when I shared my diagnosis. The entire experience of chemotherapy and surgery. The realization that I would more than likely lose ovarian function and be unable to get pregnant. The loss of my hair (which is, thankfully, growing back very quickly). So 2010 was an awful year, health wise (and I should add, not just for myself but for my dear Aunt Teri-Ann and dear friend Jeff Cross--and there are other friends who have had health issues this year and who have had their own surgeries and experiences in doctors' waiting rooms & offices). Which means that in looking forward, what I most hope for 2011 is good health. For myself, for all my loved ones, for all of you. What 2011 will actually bring is anyone's guess. I will be back in the classroom on January 11--which makes it the first time in a year that I'll be teaching undergrads (I only taught a single grad seminar Spring 2010, so this is one of the longest absences I've had from teaching undergrads). I'm still working on my book manuscript on racial ambiguity (I have 40 very rough pages on Tiger Woods that I'm not proud of ... yet, and I need to work on a chapter about transracial/transnational adoptees). I'm the conference co-chair for the annual meeting of the Association for Asian American Studies (yep, I've been doing conference stuff for the last few months while recuperating from surgery). And then there's my tenure file...I still need to be observed in the classroom--and then my department will vote on me (in late February I believe) and then I await news from the college and provost committees (keep your fingers crossed ladies and gentlemen). I've got a lot on my plate professionally. Am I better? Yes. By which I mean, I've got my hair back (yay!), I'm no longer feeling so fatigued (although I still have bouts of exhaustion and my energy level is still not 100%--after walking Bella for 40 minutes the other day I came home and collapsed. Walking for 40 minutes should NOT drain me normally...I'm not sure how I'm going to train for this 4 mile race in April if this persists). I still have some tightness in my arms and chest post-surgery, but in general I have full range of motion. And most of all, psychologically and emotionally I feel strong. But I want to clarify one thing about that last statement. While I do feel like my cancer is in the past--part of the memories of 2010 I will carry with me, I don't feel like I'm necessarily ""over"" it--I don't necessarily know if I'll ever feel the way I did pre-April 2010, mentally and emotionally that is (well, even physically since there's no way to get my original breasts back or to take away these physical scars). I have been marked by this disease, for better or worse, and I will carry those psychic scars with me, just as I wear the physical scars. They are part of my life now, and I am learning to live with them. I'm not sure how much blogging I'll be doing in this space. I suspect that I'll still write posts from time to time. There is one about my gender identity, in particular, that I'd like to explore. But for those of you who were mostly checking in to see how I was doing, you probably won't be hearing much on the health front--you hopefully won't be hearing anything significant on the cancer or N.E.D. front EVER (that'd be wonderful, wouldn't it?). So this may be the last entry you decide to read, which is fine by me. I am grateful that people wanted to know what was going on with me and checked into the blog at all. So Happy New Year! Lets hope that 2011 is good to us all, body and soul. [Me & Bruno at Folly's Beach, SC -- see, my hair IS growing back!]",0,1,0.12478647718401813
862,46,13,11,12,2010,2010-12-11,"On December 13, it will be 8 weeks since I had my bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery and 4 weeks since the last drain was removed from my right side. It will also be 12 weeks since my last round of chemo and approximately 6 months since I was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2010. How am I doing? This is the question I am most asked from friends and colleagues and acquaintances when I see them after a few days/weeks/months. It was the #1 question I got when I went to my department's holiday party last week. And my answer, genuine and consistent, is that I'm good, or to be grammatically correct, I'm well. I'm doing just fine. I'm still a bit tight in my chest--yoga and the physical therapy exercises definitely help--and I'm definitely still tired/fatigued as a result of the healing that my body is still undergoing. Case in point: after being on my feet for 3 hours on Wed. at the holiday party (and I attended the IAH party before the English dept party, so it was really TWO holiday parties I went to on Wednesday) I spent the next 2 days either in-bed or on the couch because I WAS SO TIRED I COULD NOT MOVE--QUITE LITERALLY, I WAS CRASHED OUT AND CLEARLY MY BODY WAS SAYING STOP, YOU NEED TO REST. But really, perhaps what people want to know is ""What is it like not to have breasts? How are you coping psychologically and emotionally?"" So this is the post that talks about missing my missing breasts, and why I chose NOT to do reconstructive surgery. Because I do miss my breasts. Or let me put it this way, I miss MY breasts. It's not just the abstract concept of having a breast or the gendered nature of feeling feminine by being a woman with breasts, or even noticing that my clothes don't quite fit the same way (which is definitely true) but first and foremost, I miss MY breasts--the breasts I was born with, that grew with me as I grew, that I lived with throughout my teen years and learned to take pleasure in, sexually, as I grew into my adult sexuality. And that last point--what my breasts mean to me sexually--is why I did not choose reconstruction. The truth is, prior to my cancer diagnosis, I didn't think a lot about my breasts. I liked them because they were part of my body and, in general, they've worked well for me. They weren't so big that they became cumbersome to me, and they weren't so small that I couldn't fill out a dress nicely. They were, in the words of that immortal children's tale, ""just right."" But I have to say, that I found my nipples, outside of sexual pleasure, a bit inconvenient. In U.S. society we frown on women's nipples (maybe men's nipples too, but it's more acceptable to see them). Women need to cover up their nipples--anyone who has ever seen the machinations to which starlets will go to reveal all parts of their boob except for their nipple will understand what I mean. It would be considered unprofessional for a woman at work to wear a blouse and NOT wear a bra, especially if it was a white shirt or a tight blouse. And I always found wearing bras to be inconvenient for the most part. My way out, during winter months, was the camisole top. I mention all of the above to give you a picture of how I pretty much treated, aesthetically, my breasts. How I feel about my breasts in terms of my sexual life is a different matter. And I know that saying all of this may be odd or make others feel uncomfortable, but the bottom line for me is that my breasts, my nipples, were most important to my sexual identity and sexual life. So when I learned that breast reconstruction would allow me to aesthetically look the way I used to look but would not let me FEEL the way I used to feel, that pretty much sealed the deal for me. Because as I noted above, what I want are MY breasts--I want to feel MY breasts--I don't want to just look down and see that I have breasts or be reassured that my clothes will fit exactly as they had before. First and foremost, reconstruction would feel like a cosmetic choice for me; it would hide the loss of my breasts but would not speak to my emotional loss at their absence. Let me just pause here and say that I know that my view and perspective is a pretty minority view and perspective. Anecdotally, in a very small sample of women who have had double-mastectomy surgery (like about a dozen) only one woman, my maternal aunt, elected not to have reconstructive surgery--and most of my female friends and family told me that if they were in my position, they would definitely want reconstructive surgery--that having breasts are VERY IMPORTANT to their sense of identity--to their sense of normalcy--to their sense of just being women. I do understand this. Completely. I judge no one for their choice in wanting reconstructive surgery. Especially the desire to feel normal again--to feel like you are yourself again. To not want to worry about how your clothes feel or about looking so different--of feeling self conscious while undressing in a locker room or dressing room or even in the privacy of your bedroom and bathroom. I understand the desire to want to feel whole again--and especially with what plastic surgeons are doing nowadays with nipple tattoos--and the improvements in silicon inserts--breast implants and reconstructive surgery gives women who have had mastectomies breasts that are just like their former ones or ideal breasts that they always wanted. And while, for the most part, my family and friends have been very respectful and supportive of my choices, whether they personally would choose the same route or not, what I've been surprised at is the reaction and assumptions from acquaintances and virtual strangers--that everyone assumes that I will change my mind--that the only reason I'm not choosing reconstruction is that all of this is too overwhelming for me and I will change my mind when more time has passed and I have healed. There have been nurses who have assumed I will be doing reconstruction while going through chemotherapy. Strangers have told Matthew that I may say I don't want reconstructive surgery but as a woman I will, of course, change my mind and get reconstructive surgery, I just simply don't know my own mind right now. Friends of friends have told me that I can now have larger breasts or the ideal breasts I've always wanted. Even extended family tell me not to be stubborn and to be open to getting breast reconstruction in the future, assuming that due to my contrary nature that I will secretly want reconstructive surgery a year from now but will be too proud to get it because I've been so vehement about not wanting reconstructive surgery. Is there a possibility I will change my mind? Yes, of course. I think I'd seem too truculent at this point if I say no. But if I were a betting woman, I would not count on me changing my mind. There has never been a point, prior to my cancer diagnosis, during my decision making about whether to do a lumpectomy of both breasts or the bi-lateral mastectomy, during chemotherapy, and leading up to my surgery when I ever thought that I wanted to do reconstruction. There is nothing about reconstruction that is appealing to me. It is not a judgment on anyone's decision to do reconstruction--it is my own level of comfort, my own relationship to my breasts, my own sense of what I miss about my missing breasts, that leads me to this certainty. I miss my missing breasts. I miss having part of the body that I was born with. I miss the absence of my breasts. But having new breasts--ones that aren't part of me, that don't give me any sensation or pleasure--would not take away from my sadness over missing my breasts. In fact, what I feel in my gut is that choosing reconstruction, for me, would be very wrong. It would feel wrong--it would feel false--it would not make me feel whole. On the contrary, it would remind me more starkly than the scars I currently carry with me, of what I have lost. And perhaps, most of all, what I realized before my surgery, in looking at the images I was lucky enough to find on-line of a woman who also chose not to do reconstruction (click here to see her Flickr stream), was that I would be OK. I would be OK without breasts. I would learn to live without my breasts, and it will be weird (it is weird) but at the end of the day, it will also be OK--and that most importantly of all, my decision to not do reconstruction is the right decision for me. [Addendum: I should say that my decision was reinforced by a pamphlet that my wonderful surgeon, Keith Amos, gave to me. It is distributed by a non-profit organization here in Raleigh, Myself: Together Again (click here on the link). It's a wonderful booklet that, in image and text, chronicles a young woman's bi-lateral mastectomy surgery and reconstructive surgery. It shows the scars, her port, the drains, the plastic surgeon's marks, the expanders, and finally what she looks like with her nipple tattoos and the silicon implants in. For anyone considering either breast augmentation or breast reconstruction, this is an important booklet to look at. I was glad to page through it, because my visceral reaction on seeing it was reassurance that I had made the right decision--reconstruction is not for me]",0,1,0.15466387148205335
863,46,14,15,4,2013,2013-04-15,"Three years ago today I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I remember being slightly nervous/anxious all morning and the early afternoon. And I remember chiding myself for feeling so anxious--that the results would be negative and I'd feel silly, later, for spending so much time fretting about nothing. Except that I was wrong. It wasn't nothing--it was stage 2 breast cancer in my left breast and DCIS in my right. April 15 is tax day, but it's always going to be ""the day I found out I had cancer."" How could it not? But this morning I also learned that a childhood friend, Tina, passed away yesterday. She had also had breast cancer--diagnosed much earlier than mine. I can't recall the specifics of her own diagnosis--we were friends from music camp when we were teenagers, had drifted apart, but had briefly come together from time to time when our paths crossed--when I came back to California while living in Boston (where Tina was doing a PhD in French literature at UC Berkeley and I was doing my own PhD at Boston University) and then when I was visiting Paris, where she had relocated with her husband. When she found out about my diagnosis through a mutual friend, she sent me a really lovely message--supportive and generous and funny, which sums up many of the wonderful qualities of Tina. She was also driven, smart, and beautiful. The most lasting memory I'll have of Tina is sipping a kir royale in the Latin Quarter of Paris while listening to a jazz quartet. It sounds like a cliche--one of those Parisian moments that happens in movies. And walking, afterwards, along the Seine with Tina and her husband Renaud, I felt like I was in a movie--that it was a perfect night because of where I was and who I was with. The last time I saw Tina was when she hugged me good-bye at the entrance to the metro by Notre Dame--I have a picture of the two of us, at night, with Notre Dame lit up in the background. I feel sad. And, I suppose there's also the odd coincidence of learning about her death today. When I found out, last week, that she had come back to SF to seek treatment and that she was, essentially, dying, I felt freaked out--and knew it was a matter of days. But it doesn't really make a difference knowing that someone is going to be passing soon. I suppose it might take some of the blunt shock away, and maybe it helps people prepare themselves. But it still feels shocking. Even knowing that it is going to happen--that it's inevitable--it still surprised me. There's a built in mechanism that many of us have--a denial mechanism that says we're going to live forever. Sure we'll get older and maybe we'll have injuries or illnesses, but modern medicine is a wonderful thing and you hear stories all the time about the 90 year old who ran a marathon, the 80 year old who climbed Everest, the 94 year old who went back to college and finally got that degree. And you think you'll just keep living your life until... My cancer diagnosis was like having that mechanism disabled. It was a reminder that people do die. I will die. You will die. The people we love will die. It's a mortality wake up call. And in the three years since that diagnosis, I've been able to get that mechanism to work again--I've been able, from time to time, to think that maybe I really will live forever--maybe I'll finally decide to go sky diving when I'm in my 70s. Maybe I'll have a second career as a French chef when I'm in my 80s. I've been able to think that maybe my cancer really is gone--that as the clock ticks up to my 5 year mark, maybe I'll really be able to say I'm cured. But maybe not. Maybe the mechanism, that denial mechanism, is actually permanently broken in me, like a non-digital clock that tells time correctly only twice a day--maybe that's what it's like for me and the rest of the time I know. I know I'm going to die. I just don't know when or how. That's probably one of the scars I have that won't go away. Because I wonder. When I have a weird pain in my abdomen, I wonder if a tumor is growing in my uterus or ovaries. Because when I find myself more tired than usual, I wonder if it's just being middle-aged or if it's a sign that the cancer has come back. Because when I learn that another person has died of breast cancer like my friend Tina, it's a reminder that people still die from this disease. RIP Tina. I'm glad you aren't in pain anymore. I'm sorry for everyone you left behind who will have a Tina sized hole in their hearts. I'm grateful to have known you and to have my last memory of you be a picture perfect Parisian memory that is happy. Thank you.",0,1,0.13740930431071274
864,46,15,20,4,2011,2011-04-20,"It has been a year (over a year actually) since I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. The anniversary happened last Friday--April 15 (tax day). It is also the day after Matthew's birthday, so this year we spent Friday waiting for the Best Buy Geek Squad to come by because as a surprise for Matthew and in celebration of his 30th birthday (yes, he's a young'un) I got him a complete home theater system--as in a 46"" plasma flat screen t.v. and a rotating wall mount that comes out 20 inches from the wall and a blu ray player that has wifi capability (yay for streaming Netflix and Pandora) and a copy of Inception. So Friday was spent waiting for the Best Buy guys. Because they give you this range (in our case it was 8-12pm) but then Elvis, our Geek tech, said he couldn't find the t.v., so by the time they got here (11:30am) and sussed out our place, and actually did the installation (which included cutting into the dry wall, going into the crawlspace underneath our house to route the cable to the new side of the living room where we were mounting the television) it was 3:30pm. And because I was battling the tail end of the adenovirus, it meant that I was pretty wiped out by the afternoon, so my plan of commemorating the day with a trip to the tattoo parlor to get a lotus tattoo put on my right ankle just didn't happen because I had a rip roaring headache and decided I should just lie down and nap (which I did in-between watching Netflix films in true couch potato style by lying down and barely moving from one spot). So why am I sharing all of the mundane facts about my year cancer anniversary diagnosis? Because I have been thinking about how to honor and commemorate the day. And the plan, as modest as it was, was for me to get the t.v. installed in the morning and then go to the tattoo parlor in the afternoon. But the tattoo parlor was busy until 7pm and I was too tired, and truly, the best laid plans you can make for yourself can just end up falling by the wayside. Which is OK. At least this is what I tell myself. The plans I have made for myself have often not come through--and certainly the caner diagnosis happening a year ago put on hold or indefinitely postponed many different plans that Matthew and I had for our lives together. Like our honeymoon (which we are taking this August) and our plans to start a family (which we are hoping to take the first of many steps taken over many months by attending an info session this summer about open adoption). There's more that I've wanted to write in this space--about feeling better once I recognized that I was depressed, in large part because the recognition itself is therapeutic but also because I have an amazing therapist, Phyllis, who I can't say enough positive things about. And the warmer weather has also helped my mood--as has the increase, the slow increase, in my energy level--which got a boost by going to NYC over spring break and hanging out with my cousins Wayne and Craig. I also wanted to write about Relay for Life--which happened 2 weeks ago without me walking the survivor's opening lap because I was felled by the adenovirus, but truthfully I wasn't sure I was up for being clapped at while walking around the track (more on that later), and finally, I wanted to write about my decision to try to write, in a more formal and organized way, some of my story--about what it has been like for me to have this diagnosis. Anyway, this isn't a very coherent post, I know. But it was a year ago today, April 20, 2010, that I wrote my first entry in this blog. And because I like symmetry and because I did want to mark the year anniversary of my diagnosis in some way, I thought it was high time that I broke my blogging silence and acknowledged that I've had a roller coaster of a year. I can't say that it's all been awful. I mean the awful stuff has been awful--I wouldn't wish chemo on my worst enemy, my hair falling out was horrific, my recovery from surgery was painful, and being faced with the potential reality that my life span may be cut short meant moments of fear, anxiety, and terror. But this past year also was the year I married Matthew and had a weekend full of family and friends and love and laughter and great food. And I turned in my tenure file in August and received the great news that the vote in my department was unanimous in February, and just this past Monday I received a phone call from my chair that the second hurdle was over (the College committee) and my file was on its way to the Provost's committee--which is essentially the 3rd and final hurdle. So there has been pleasure as well as pain, and light as well as darkness. Which is pretty much what life is. Which means I don't think I really did learn any new or profound wisdom after being diagnosed with cancer. I think I just re-learned the things that I already knew--that life is unpredictable and you can make all the plans you want, but sometimes things happen and you just have to roll with them. Sometimes it's OK to just lie on the sofa watching Netflix films and napping. I tend to burn the candle at both ends so it's a good reminder and metaphor for me--that the world will not stop spinning on its axis if I'm not constantly in motion and if the plans I make don't actually happen. I wish I had something more profound to share on my year anniversary, but maybe that's about as profound as I get. Or maybe it's appropriate because sometimes the profundity of a situation isn't going to just happen because I want to mark the anniversary of an event.",0,1,0.12440571811053741
865,46,16,16,8,2012,2012-08-16,"Last week, on August 9, 2012, renowned humorist and This American Life contributor, David Rakoff died. He died, essentially, because a tumor had developed in his left shoulder--a cancerous tumor that was brought about by the radiation treatment he underwent in his 20s when he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. I was in the shower listening to NPR when they announced his death. And I cried. I didn't know David Rakoff personally, but I did feel like I ""knew"" him through his writing (he's the author of 3 books and a 4th that will be published posthumously). I also knew him through his radio pieces for This American Life--most recently a bit he did playing Dr Seuss. I admired his writing and his radio essays, but I cried because I was scared. For me. I had written previously about cancer making you selfish--or rather, making me selfish. I think this is sort've natural. I also don't want to paint myself into being a terrible monster. I am genuinely sad about Rakoff's passing. Just as I was genuinely sad when Elizabeth Edwards passed away a year and a half ago. Just as I was and still am genuinely sad over the death of my favorite aunt from leukemia. But I am also scared. Not in a way where I am paralyzed or I think about my mortality constantly. But I definitely know that hearing about David Rakoff's cancer coming back a second time and then hearing the news about his death makes me feel scared. It makes me wonder if that's going to happen to me. My fear doesn't last very long--enough to cry in the shower mourning David Rakoff and feeling anxious about my future. And then I dry myself off and go about my day. But I wanted to write about fear because I think it's something we have a hard time acknowledging--those of us who have a cancer diagnosis or who have a loved one with a cancer diagnosis. And recently I was reminded about the need we have to keep positive while reading this piece in the New York Times, part of their ""Life, Interrupted"" series which chronicles the thoughts and feeling of Suleika Jaouad. Quoting Barbara Ehrenreich's critique of the bright-siding of cancer, Jaouad, after admitting that she has tried to keep a positive attitude towards everything she has been dealing with related to her cancer, writes: At what point is positivity a form of denial? Does positivity at all costs have a cost? I’m not a negative person, and I’m certainly not trying to set up a school for negative thinking, but today I’m giving myself permission to step out of the spin zone of positivity — to stare down fear, anxiety and dread without the guilt that I might be giving up or not fighting hard enough. And reading her essay reminded me of what I had forgotten because I am no longer living with it on a daily basis: Cancer is hard. It's not about being positive or negative. It's about cancer being a difficult disease to navigate. And it's difficult on so many levels--because chemotherapy is horrible and the side effects can be crippling. But most of all, because it's scary. It's scary to think that you are putting your body through all of these treatments--of getting poked and prodded and having parts of yourself cut open and cut off. And we do this because we want to have the best outcome possible--we want the cancer to go away, and we want to live. So it's sad and scary to hear about people who did all these things, like David Rakoff, and who, none-the-less, dies from cancer related complications. Not a cherry post, I know. But I think it's OK to admit that I'm scared. Just a little bit. I think it's important, in fact, to acknowledge that I went through something horribly difficult and life altering. And that the scars that I wear are not simply on my chest.",0,-1,-0.07328939275660586
866,46,17,7,10,2011,2011-10-07,"So yesterday I saw the film 50/50. I had blogged about it earlier and had been eager to watch it because it seemed at least in the trailers, to be a frank and funny look at what it is like to get a cancer diagnosis and go through treatment. What I wasn’t prepared for was that it was also very heartfelt. Many cancer films often, intentionally or not, traffic in sentimentality—there is the stirring music, the sick patient lying stoicly in the hospital room, the tragic revelation of disease or death. There wasn’t anything sentimental about this film. It was one of the things I had been hoping for—an unsentimental look at cancer. But that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t hard—that it wasn’t emotionally stirring. Because in its direct approach and in the portrayal of this man’s experience going to chemo and having surgery, it so vividly mirrored my own experience—the kind of prosaic nature of what it’s like to sit in a chemo chair for 4 hours, the kinds of conversations you strike up with folks in neighboring chairs. The fear that you try not to show or even acknowledge to yourself let alone to others, and yet that does surface, as it will surface, when you are wondering whether the treatment is working. Whether you will survive this surgery. And it was the scene of the surgery in particular that really caught me off guard. I’m not going to give anything away (and the fact that he has surgery is also not something that anyone who is going to watch a cancer film is going to be surprised at either hopefully) but I did want to explain what it was that hit me in the gut. It was his vulnerability. And I don’t necessarily mean what the actor portrayed (although I do think that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job in this scene of portraying vulnerability)—I guess what I mean is the simple image of seeing him in a gown on a gurney about to be wheeled into surgery, saying good-bye to his mother and talking to the anesthesiologist about not being sure whether they’d give you enough drugs so that you wouldn’t wake up in the middle of the procedure or that they would give you too much so that you wouldn’t wake up in recovery. Apparently these were the exact questions I asked before my own surgery. I don’t remember—the whole thing was a blur. But when we were driving back from the film yesterday Matthew reminded me that I asked my own anesthesiologist these very questions. And he admitted that he cried in this scene because it was so real—because just a year ago, that had been me, with Matthew and my Mom—saying good-bye to me before being wheeled in to have my double-mastectomy surgery. The weird thing is, I don’t remember being nervous. I’m pretty sure that they slipped in some anti-anxiety meds in my i.v. line (smart thing), so what I recall isn’t panic or fear but just a sense of calm. I remember feeling like it would all be OK, I’d take a nap and then I’d wake up and… I suppose it’s the “and” that I didn’t know how to wrap my mind around. And in some ways still don’t. Which is why seeing that character being wheeled into surgery just hit me in the gut. Because he said all the things I had been thinking and feeling and a year later, still carry with me. The grief of a cancer diagnosis—of my cancer diagnosis—hasn’t resolved. I wonder whether it will.",0,1,0.0888541666666667
867,46,18,18,10,2011,2011-10-18,"One year ago today, October 18, I underwent a bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery as part of my breast cancer treatment. I went to the hospital in the morning with my husband and mother, where the radiology clinic injected my breasts with dye (which really hurt!) to trace the dye to my sentinel lymph nodes (which they removed along with my breasts to ensure that the cancer hadn't migrated to my lymph system). And then I waited for about two hours (maybe it was even three) before being taken into the pre-surgery room. I was hooked up to an i.v. My personal items were put in a bag (including my glasses, which I'm blind without). I hugged my Mom and Matthew good-bye. And then I was wheeled into the surgery, where the last thing I remembered was the anesthesiologist telling me that he would count to three and I should be asleep, and I think I made it to one... And then there was the very disorienting experience of waking up in the recovery room. I felt very groggy and confused. I could hear the voice of an elderly man who was crying and demanding to be let out and the angry voice of a nurse telling him that he just finished surgery and he needed to calm down. When I could finally open my eyes and signal to a nurse, I felt a pain in my throat (they had to intubate me during the surgery) and I was incredibly thirsty. And I wanted to know where Matthew and my mother were. The nurse found Matthew, they wheeled me to my private room (with my mother meeting me en-route), and they told me how to work the pain meds (which I immediately did click). This all happened a year ago. Literally. It's now 6:05pm and I got out of surgery at about this time a year ago. And it seems so odd that I went through this experience. A friend just yesterday asked if I felt disconnected from the experience--as if this all happened to someone else. And that's not how I feel at all--I definitely felt it, I definitely lived it. And now? Now...I'm trying to figure out what it's like to have gone through this. Not in a way that will give me closure--there isn't real closure for me about this. I'm trying to find a language and a way to tell this story, I suppose (this is the professional/academic part of me coming out--the side of me that thinks in terms of narrative). I'm trying to make sense of this experience--of trying to sort out my feelings about all of this--what I went through in the past and how I'm dealing with this now. One of the things that I've been trying to sort out is, just how bad was it? I think there are multiple reasons I ask this. One is that it's partly my nature--I pride myself in being the person who tries to suck it up and push through and not whine about how hard things are. Did going through chemotherapy suck? Was losing my breasts hard? Yes and yes. But I'm alive. And compared to others--those who are facing metastic cancer, breast or otherwise, I seem to be doing pretty well. And compared to relatives who have died from cancer (an uncle to colon cancer, an aunt to leukemia), my treatment was not that bad and my prognosis is definitely good. And truthfully, I don't know that when I was going through everything that I felt like I was suffering. Yes, chemotherapy is toxic--it's a hard treatment to endure. I lost my hair. My taste buds changed. I developed neuropathy in my fingers. I was constantly fatigued. And recovering from surgery was hard. I still feel twinges of pain from the scars where my drains came out of my body. But I don't know that I felt like I was struggling. Maybe because I had A LOT of support. Maybe because I had a lot of information. Maybe because I had wonderful examples of women who survived and are now thriving, who had once been diagnosed with breast cancer. So there's a part of me that feels like what I went through, while hard, wasn't THAT hard--that I didn't experience it as a constant trauma. And yet. I feel traumatized. Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes. [and yes, I just plagiarized from Walt Whitman--although is it plagiarism when you admit the source?] And that's the rub. On the one hand, I feel that what I went through was manageable and not that bad and that as someone who lived through this experience, the important thing is that I LIVED through it--and I did so relatively intact and without experiencing any seriously horrible side-effects--and I had HUGE HUGE support. But on the other hand...I'm forever altered. I am literally deformed. De-formed. I have grief for my breasts and the sense of what if...what if it comes back...what if I am one of the women who develops metastic breast cancer... So it's been a year since my surgery. And to commemorate this year anniversary, I decided to alter my body through a piece of permanent body art--a tattoo: [view of tattoo on the inside of my left ankle] [close-up of lotus tattoo] I chose a lotus because of its symbolism of renewal--of beauty born from the muck and mud--and of its Buddhist symbolism of enlightenment and progress.

869,46,2,23,11,2010,2010-11-23,"As those of you following my blog (and thank you for this!) know, last week Tuesday I had my last drain removed, and I was ecstatic! I mean, all day I just felt euphoric--the difference was both literal/physical and emotional/psychological. I was looking forward to all the things I could start to do, again, of increasing my physical therapy routine so that I could be on a golf course mid-December. And then. I woke up Thursday with a fever. I had a head cold that I was battling on but I didn't think much of a little head cold--I figured the sore throat would go away soon and then all would be well--nothing could stop me! Well, something has. Because it is day #6 of me waking up with a mild fever--and yesterday (morning #5) I finally went to see my doctor who confirmed that I have an adenovirus--and my symptoms (low grade fever of around 100-101.7, body aches/pains, sore throat, lots of phlegm) can persist for 2 weeks and I'm, potentially, contagious through but most especially for someone like me who is recovering from surgery and the effects of chemo, my immune system is working really hard and so the risk for secondary infections (like pneumonia) is high, so my doctor has prescribed bed rest for another week! And she has especially admonished me to avoid crowd and children. Which means I'll be spending Thanksgiving with Bruno (I'm sending Matthew to his folks, even though he has vounteered to stay home and take care of me, but honestly, all I'm doing is sleeping and watching movies and reading novels. I'm not very good company right now). It makes me very sad not to be able to join Jane & John for Thanksgiving--it has been my tradition since moving to Chapel Hill to spend turkey day at the Danielwicz-McGowan homestead--and I was especially looking forward to this year since Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday (who doesn't love a holiday devoted to eating and family--OK, racial politics with American Indians are problematic--I get that). The even sadder thing about my condition is that I have no appetite. So truth be told, I don't even feel like eating right now. Which was one big tip off to me that I really needed to see the doctor--me not feel like eating? Definitely something is wrong. And of course since bad news or bad things happen in groups (often in 3's), yesterday was also the day that my laptop monitor decided to go on the fritz. I can ""sort've"" see the screen, but not really--enough for me to hook up my external hard drive and back up all the files that I need, but not enough to be able to read anything that I could open. So it's off to the Apple store for my poor little laptop (which is 4 years old--I've had it as long as I've been with Matthew). So that's what's new in my world. It seems ironic (and I do think I'm using this correctly, unlike Ms. Morisettte) that right when I get my drain out and am finally mobile again, I literally am not getting out of bed because I just lack the energy and interest in doing anything other than sleeping. And of course it's just very unjust to lose my appetite right before Thanksgiving (sigh). But I suppose I shouldn't be moaning and groaning too much. I mean, I may not currently have my ""health"" so to speak, but I am definitely on the road to recovery (hence the awkward title post). And I'm REALLY looking forward to the day when I get all my mobility back, when my hair grows back, and when I start to *feel* like I did before.

872,46,22,2,9,2011,2011-09-02,"Let me tell you about my Aunt Teri. When I was growing up, I had 2 Aunts named Teresa--with different middle names. So as a way to distinguish them, I called the youngest one, Shaoliang, which my father said meant ""little aunt"" in Mandarin. It, apparently, also sounds close to ""little sheep"" and so I used to draw a picture of a little sheep when I would write letters to her. My Aunt Teri was one of those people who created community wherever she lived--and she and my Uncle moved around to various places throughout their lives. But she really had a knack of cultivating friendships of a breadth and depth that is unusual--in other words, she has both a very large and intimate circle of friends from every place she has ever lived. When I recently confessed to her that I was nervous at the thought of being a parent (Matthew and I are looking into adoption--which will be the subject of a future post, I'm sure--what it's like to be a breast cancer survivor going through the domestic adoption process) and when I asked her whether she had ever been nervous, she told me that she had always known that she wanted to be a mother--that it was one of the things she was most proud of--and that she knew that it was what she was meant to do--be a Mom--be someone who could give unconditional love to children. My Aunt Teri was a stubborn person--a trait common on both sides of my family. She had stores of compassion but also stores of stuborness--she was not a pushover but could assert herself in a caring yet forceful way. There were times when she would not take no for an answer. She knew how to fight for what she wanted--for what she felt was right--for what was important. This morning my Aunt Teri passed away after complications due to her marrow transplant, which was a result of being diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in February 2010 (2 months before my own breast cancer diagnosis). I got the call right before my 10am class--and I had to shut the door on my emotions in order to get through class (something I've learned to be good at--compartementalizing that is, because I got the news about my cancer diagnosis half an hour before a grad seminar a year and a half ago). Although I've teared up throughout the day--and gotten choked up--I haven't yet had a proper cry. As I told one cousin, I feel emotionally constipated--I can feel something sitting inside my chest, wanting to be let out. And I trust that when the moment is right, my emotions will come spilling out. When I got my breast cancer diagnosis, my aunt was one of the first people to call and reach out to me. She shared helpful hints and suggestions about going through chemo and things to eat. We talked about our similar experiences--and the differences in our cancer treatment and care. We were connected in this intimate manner, which I know is something neither of us wanted to have happen. This is the fourth relative I've had die of cancer--the first on my father's side. It all feels surreal--the number of family I've had who have died of various cancers. My Aunt Teri was one of my favorite people. She was someone I confided in and trusted. She is someone I love wholeheartedly and who will always live in my heart. And I will always miss her. Always.

873,46,23,31,8,2011,2011-08-31,"So first of all, an apology. Both for the long lapse between blog posts (I knew it had been a while, but June 5??? That's a REALLY long time) and for not explaining that I'd be taking a break from blogging. Of course, the truth is, I didn't realize that I was taking a break from blogging. Maybe more specifically, taking a break from thinking about cancer. My cancer. My post-cancer life. Being N.E.D. (no evidence of disease). But a while ago, when someone asked me if I was still blogging on this site, I said that I wanted to take a break from thinking of myself as someone with cancer or someone who had had cancer. But I should have said this all in a brief post--especially because looking at the last post, where I'm about to see whether I have a cyst or malignancy on my uterus, it leaves people wondering a bit. So the first thing I'll say is that my ultrasound was clear. All is good. And my follow-up appointment with my surgeon was also good (I think that happened a few days after I wrote the last post). I'm taking Tamoxifen, and aside from a few hot flashes, mostly at night (2-3 episodes), I don't seem to be having any side effects. I am, by all physical evidence at least, the vision of health. I've been exercising and lost a few of the pounds I gained in the spring semester when I was too weary to do anything beyond teach and sleep. My mental health is good--or at least I'm no longer experiencing a low level depression. And there doesn't seem to be any signs of cancer in my body that they can detect through blood work of physical examination--and my body seems to be holding up pretty well so far, meaning I'm having no other health issues and feel fine. So I'm a healthy person. I look like a healthy person. I feel like a healthy person. Yet there is that little question in the back of my mind--am I? Or perhaps more accurately, ""for how long?"" Because truthfully, even if I never have a recurrence, as my body ages I will probably have some kind of health issue where I experience a period of not being well--of being disabled--of being ill. We all will. It's a sobering thought. And the fact that I think this way is probably a sign both of what I've recently experienced with cancer/chemo/surgery as well as a sign that I'm getting older and recognizing that my 41 year old body is not my 21 year old body and will one day be a 61 year old body with different types of challenges (joints, I'm told, become a problem as we age). In other words, these are the musings of a middle-age person not of a young, vibrant 20-something or teen or even 30 something person--at least not someone who hasn't been through or witnessed intimately the deterioration of someone else's body or their own for a period of time. Anyway, I thought about whether I wanted to take this blog down, but I think that there are still things I'm exploring and figuring out about living my life post-cancer. And there are certainly things about cancer in the world that I think are worth commenting on--like this piece in The New York Times about the language of cancer--especially all those ""fighting"" words we associate with the disease. And there's the presentation I gave at the annual meeting of the Association of Asian American Studies--one that talked about my experiences with getting breast cancer and the lack of Asian American models and stories out there. It was the most intimate presentation I have ever given--and while I was nervous when I first started to read my paper, by the end I had found my stride and really felt comfortable talking about what I'd been through, both from a personal as well as intellectual point-of-view. So I'm not done blogging here. I may not be updating on a regular basis--there will probably be weeks between posts. But if you are curious about what life is like for one particular former stage 2 breast cancer patient, please continue to tune in.",0,1,0.14147478930087623
874,46,24,5,6,2011,2011-06-05,"About 3 months ago, I had an appointment with my Ob-Gyn. Now this may be TMI (isn't this whole blog TMI???) but the reason I went in was that my period had come back WITH A VENGANCE. I suppose after not having a period for nearly 9 months it's not unexpected to have the floodgates open, so to speak. But it freaked me out--especially because 9 months prior to my cancer diagnosis I had had surgery to remove some fibroids that had caused serious bleeding issues to the point where they had to infuse me with 3 bags of blood prior to my surgery to get my hematacrit & hemoglobin levels to the point where they could do surgery (yep, I was that bad off--if I was alive a century ago I'd be dead by now -- and not from the cancer but from the fibroids). Anyway, during the ultrasound of my uterus a spot was found on my ovaries. It could have been simply a residual spot from having recently had my period. Or it could be a benign cyst. Or a malignant tumor. When I met with my gynecologist, he wanted to see me in another month and repeat the ultrasound because given my recent cancer history, he thought it was better to be on the safe side. And the good news is that when they repeated the exam, the spot had disappeared. Was I worried? Not terribly. I suppose I figured the law of averages would kick in--like, I couldn't possibly be diagnosed with ovarian cancer less than a year after being diagnosed with breast cancer, right? And I tend not to worry until I need to worry--at least not consciously worry. But the truth is, I am afraid of recurrence. How could I not be? The tamoxifen treatment that I'm on has certain side effects and risks associated with it--namely the risk of developing a fatal type of uterine cancer. The percentage of women who develop this type of uterine cancer while on the tamoxifen treatment is very small--certainly statistically smaller than the advantages to being on tamoxifen for 5 years. So I take this daily pill and hope for the best. Yet it freaks me out to think that my body, in reaction to this hormone therapy that is supposed to prevent the original breast cancer tumor cells from spreading to other parts of my body may, in fact, be creating new types of cancer cells in my uterus. And when I say it freaks me out, it's not like I want to get a hysterectomy or that I worry about it every day. But when I read this report in The New York Times last night, I was first of all very glad to hear that tamoxifen and other treatments that they give to women after a breast cancer diagnosis are now being used to prevent breast cancer from every occurring--that these drugs are being used as a preventative, prophylactic measure. However, it was a jolt to read that among the serious side effects of tamoxifen are blood clots--and of course the National Cancer Institute has a Question & Answer page that lists, clearly, what the negative side effects are--and right there are blood clots, strokes, uterine cancer, and cataracts. How can I police my body for these issues? Should I wonder every time I feel a tingling in my arm? A cramp in my abdomen? A blurring in my eyes? I don't want to turn into a hypocondriac. And quite frankly, uterine cancer can be very hard to detect early since we don't have access to our uterus--I can't really see or feel it, except once a month, and then that's in the form of cramping--it's not like I can check around for a tumor by reaching inside my body and feeling around. I did get a baseline reading on my eyes from the wonderful folks at Carrboro Family Vision and the amazing Dr. Jason Chow. So far my eyes look like the eyes of a healthy 41 year old woman (meaning, I probably need bi-focals in 4 years, but that's part and parcel with aging). I guess I'm musing about these things because I think, in part, I have to live my life the way I lived my life prior to getting my cancer diagnosis--meaning, I can't worry about every little ache and pain. I can't worry about whether the cancer is going to come back on a daily basis. It might--and my follow-up appointments with my surgeon and oncologist and my regular physical with my primary care physician and appointments with my gynecologist, should be maintained to make sure that I'm doing OK. But I think I have to try to live with the fear of recurrence without letting that fear take over my life.",0,1,0.1109361471861472
876,46,26,16,5,2011,2011-05-16,"I know I haven't been writing on a regular basis in this blog. The semester really kicked my ass, energy wise. And then realizing that I was dealing with low-grade depression also left me for a loop (thank goodness for a great psychotherapist--I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Phyllis Hicks!). And of course the end of semester is always just a busy time--meeting with students, grading papers, tying up loose ends. But perhaps I also haven't been writing because I've been taking a break from thinking about cancer or thinking about my cancer in particular. And I realize that I've been a bit allergic to thinking about myself as a cancer survivor or someone with cancer. It's not, exactly, that I want to pass as a healthy person (and by writing that, I don't mean to suggest that I'm not healthy right now, but as someone only a year past diagnosis and less than a year past chemo and surgery, I'm not exactly sure that ""healthy"" is what comes to mind when I think about my body) or to deny the experience that I had this past year with chemo and surgery--and the uncertainty that any cancer diagnosis brings. But I think I wanted to think of myself as ""normal"" again--or at least as not a cancer patient anymore. Yet two weeks ago I was thrust in the belly of the beast so to speak--because I flew to Milwaukee to see a favorite aunt of mine (I'll call her ""T"" to protect her privacy and that of my uncle ""B""). Aunt T was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia last February. My original plan was to fly out to see her over the summer, but then 2 months later I received my own cancer diagnosis, so 2 weeks ago was the soonest I could fly out to spend any substantive time with her. Unfortunately that time was spent in the Bone Marrow Transplant ward, where she returned to after her successful haploidentical transplant (in her case a stem cell transplant from 2 different sources) due to infections she had developed, which also led to her malnutrition issues, which then led to edema (swelling). I had originally planned to visit her and to help with her homecare post-transplant surgery, but instead I found myself visiting her every day for the week that I was there, observing proper protocol for someone who is in an isolation room--meaning, I scrubbed my hands thoroughly and put on a paper gown before entering her room, and I scrubbed my hands thoroughly after I left. [Note: these procedures were more to protect other bone marrow transplant patients from catching one of the infections that she developed rather than protecting her from anything I was bringing in, although I'm sure that must have helped] The good news (because I should cut to the good news) is that my aunt is improving and the even better news is that the transplant seems to be working--her body is producing white and red blood cells--remission may well be part of her future. But good news aside, it is sobering to visit anyone in a bone marrow transplant unit, regardless of the prognosis. It was a chance for me to see, very up close and personal, what happens to us when our bodies fail us--particularly when we receive a cancer diagnosis so extreme that it requires what seems to me to be a radical procedure--to erase one's immune system and source of blood and replace it with someone else's (or multiple someone else's in my aunt's case). Any transplant has risks and dangers involved--a bone marrow transplant is no different, and, indeed, is in many ways more risky, I think, because of the concern of the cancer coming back despite the pain and agony (physical but especially emotional and psychological) of the transplant. I was worried before leaving for Milwaukee that I would feel freaked out--that seeing my aunt in the hospital and visiting her, particularly, in the BMT ward, would hit too close to home--would make me feel my own vulnerability regarding a cancer diagnosis too keenly. I was worried that I might freeze up around her--that I would be awkward and werid--would not know the right thing to say or do. I suppose in many ways I felt the way that others feel when confronted with a loved one who is sick or has cancer. I suppose in many ways I felt the way that many healthy people hearing about my breast cancer diagnosis felt--that they didn't know what to say or do and worried they might say the wrong thing. And while the first two days were hard for me, emotionally, I quickly recognized that as hard as it might have been to see my aunt in her current state, it was much harder to BE my aunt. And being with her for a week was illuminating to me about how much she wants to live--how much she wants to fight her disease (her motto is ""kicking butt"" with respect to her cancer--perhaps we are both angry Asian American women when it comes to this disease). It was illuminating, to me, to see my aunt in her condition because I realized that at some point, this might be me or it might be someone else I love. And what I mean by that is, in spending time with my aunt in the BMT ward, I recognized the fragility and vulnerability of the human body. I know I've written about this before, but my cancer diagnosis has had me thinking more and more about my own mortality and about what the end of my life will be like. It is uncertain--all of our lives are uncertain in that respect--but I feel after this recent experience with my aunt that I have a greater appreciation for what happens when our bodies start to fail us, regardless of the reason why and regardless of whether it's temporary (which I hope it is in my aunt's case) or permanent (as it will be eventually for all of us).",0,1,0.1459793607752791
878,46,4,11,2,2011,2011-02-11,"Yesterday was a first for me--I used my identity as a ""cancer"" patient (or former cancer patient or cancer survivor--so hard to know which phrase is most apropos for me) to illustrate a point I was making in my Asian American lit and theory course. Right now we're reading NYU Law School professor Kenji Yoshino's Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights (click here for the link to the book's website). One of my students asked for a clarification of the key concept of Yoshino's book, namely how covering differs from passing. Now, I'm very comfortable with using myself or elements from my life, especially in terms of my ethnicity, race, and gender, to help illuminate aspects of what I'm teaching--particularly when it's in a class on Asian American subjects. So it wasn't unusual for me to draw from my personal identity to clarify a theoretical concept related to race or identitarian issues. But it was DEFINITELY a first for me to draw from my most recent experiences with cancer. And this is what I said. If, during the middle of my chemotherapy treatments--the period in which I clearly lost my hair due to this treatment--I wore a wig and found myself at a dinner party with a group of people and I never brought up my cancer diagnosis or on-going chemotherapy treatment--if, in fact, when complimented on my new hairstyle, if I simply said thank you or didn't elaborate on the fact that I was wearing a wig, then I would be passing--I would be deliberately hiding my cancer diagnosis and masking the visible effects of my cancer treatment. I would be ""passing"" as a healthy person rather than as a cancer patient. However, if I was open about my cancer diagnosis and my chemotherapy treatment, and the fact that I had lost my hair but then still wore a wig to this dinner party--either to not make others feel uncomfortable from the visible difference I present as a cancer patient or to make myself more comfortable to not be so visibly marked by my cancer--then I'd be ""covering""--there is no denial about the fact that I have cancer, but I would also not draw any attention to my status as a cancer patient. After I gave this example the students nodded their heads, and I moved on with the next phase of my lesson. But it was an odd feeling, realizing that I had just used my cancer as a way to illustrate an intellectual issue in the classroom--that I had so publicly performed my cancer identity for my students. Because what was odd wasn't the insertion of the personal with the professional--as I noted before, I've often used aspects of my identity in making or illustrating a point in the classroom. What was odd was realizing that I had integrated, seemingly seamlessly, the identity of a cancer patient/cancer survivor to the point where I COULD use it as an example in the classroom. Is this an intellectual leap, for me, to accept and recognize the place of cancer in my life--to my sense of self? Is it now a part of my indelible identity in the same way that I think of my gender and race and ethnicity as immutable (even while, of course, recognizing that intellectually I know that these are also social constructs--can I ever turn off the academic in me)?

880,46,6,1,1,2013,2013-01-01,"So this seems about par for the course--a new blog post every 3-4 months. Of course I had often thought about writing and posting in this space. I'm never sure if there's anyone still reading this blog, but I thought that it's still useful to have it up for the older posts, the ones that are happening in ""real time"" in terms of my initial breast cancer diagnosis, treatment decisions, chemo, surgery, and recovery. If you want to read any of those posts, you can look on the right and see the key blog posts I've highlighted that gives you a sense of my story so far. But this is a new year. Specifically, it's the first day of 2013. The doomsday folks who misread the Mayan calendar were wrong--life didn't end on 12/12/12. We also managed to avoid going over a fiscal cliff (well, perhaps--the House still has to approve the deal). We are all still alive. Although I suppose this is a point where I could wax on in philosophical fashion about how much longer I or anyone else has on this planet. For better or worse, what my cancer diagnosis and everything that followed from it has meant is that I'm more aware of my mortality--more aware that I am alive, for now, but whether it will be the recurrence of my cancer, a new cancer (tamoxifen makes me at risk for uterine cancer, and the chemo made me at risk for ovarian cancer) or just the vagaries of life (random acts of violence, accidents, illnesses--wow, this is turning into a rather somber new year's blog post). Yet that's not what I want to write about, not today. What I want to write about, the ""looking back"" part, is a post I've said I was going to write for over two years: What it's like not to have breasts. [Aside: for anyone new to this blog, I had bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery in mid-October, 2010 without reconstructive surgery. For more on my reasons not to do reconstruction, click here for this older blog post] I must say that the answer I would have given you in January 2011 would be different than January 2012 and now, January 2013. In the weeks and months after my bi-lateral mastectomy surgery, I was very low. Perhaps not a full throttled depression, but there were so many things to juggle, mentally and emotionally, related to my breast cancer and related to my life in general. The first time I took a shower after I was out of the hospital, I just sobbed. I cried every time I took a shower and had to change and saw the bandages, the drains, the empty space where my breasts had been. And the first time that Matthew and I had sex, I sobbed, and he just held me and told me it was going to be OK. That's been the hardest part. Perhaps that's an overly intimate thing to share, but it's true--it's what I had suspected all along when I was trying to decide whether to do the mastectomy surgery or just the lumpectomy with follow-up radiation. I knew that losing my breasts meant losing sexual pleasure. And while I could have had replacement breasts that would ""look"" like my old breasts (or newer, better breasts), the sexual stimulation and pleasure would be gone (you can't have nipple stimulation with a fake nipple and silicon breasts). And there's the clothing issue. I gave away several dresses and blouses that really didn't fit anymore--that didn't look good without my breasts--or because I was too self conscious with the low cleavage showing my scar tissue. So shopping has been a new challenge. Never a fan of the cowl neck line previously, I now have 3 different cowl neck sweaters/dresses because for some reason this look works for breastless women. It's been over 2 years since my surgery. The scars have healed (although I still don't have much sensation in my chest area or underneath my arms--apparently when they remove your lymph nodes and your breasts and cut through these nerves, they can take a long time to wake up, if they ever do--my surgeon says not to worry about it, so I don't). And I've healed. I don't walk around thinking about myself as someone with breast cancer. Then again, I never forget it. Like with any non-visible but potent identity, it's something I'm always aware of but don't think about all the time. So the word I would use, now, to talk about not having breasts? Normal. This is my new normal. And not having breasts feels normal to me. I can name a few milestones. The first time I changed in a woman's locker room at a spa. I was extraordinarily self conscious--this was pretty early on, February 2011. I wanted to treat myself to a few spa treatments because my skin was wrecked after chemo (chapped, dry, dehydrated) and because I wanted to treat myself after going through that whole experience. I was the only person in the locker room, but I worried that there might be other women who would come in and see me...and then what? I don't know whether I was afraid that they'd be embarrassed or I'd be embarrassed or both. And what would we be embarrassed about? My deformity (because that's what it felt like then). My visible mark of having breast cancer? I changed quickly and was grateful that no one came in. I considered this a minor triumph that I didn't use the privacy booth but was able to just change in public, even if I felt anxious about it. The next milestone also came at a spa, this time in San Francisco this past May 2010. I was going to a Japanese bath house with my old college roommates. I'd been naked around them many, many times--including post-surgery (we all rented a house and went skinny dipping in the hot tub). But this would be the first time I would be naked not just with them but in a public space with other women--women I didn't know. You can wear a bathing suit, but of the thirty to forty women I encountered at the spa, I'd say only about three women opted to wear a bathing suit. Everyone else (as I figured they would) were naked. I had brought along my bathing suit and just assumed that I'd be one of the few women going clothed, but when we were in the locker room and I started getting out of my street clothes, I just simply put on my robe without the suit and walked out with the rest of my friends. And while I was initially self conscious, I quickly forgot about my breastless difference from the other breasted women and just enjoyed being in so much water and steam and with my very dear and close friends. It might have also helped that without my glasses, I'm blind as a bat so I couldn't see if anyone had a weird reaction to seeing me and my missing breasts. The last milestone just happened in November. I was attending a conference in San Juan Puerto Rico (The American Studies Association--yes, it does sound like a boondoggle, but I was actually on two panels). A group of friends rented a set of condos a block from the beach, so we were constantly going back and forth between the conference site and the beach. The friend I was sharing a room with is someone I've known for nearly a decade, but we had never really lived together like roommates before. Nevertheless, we're very comfortable with each other and early on I asked if she minded if I just walked naked from my room to the bathroom (easier than doing the towel thing--and I suppose I'm outing myself, but I do walk around naked in my house -- with the windows shut of course -- if it's just easier going from one room to another). Anyway, it wasn't until after I returned home that I realized this was the first time I had been naked around someone new when I didn't ask them if they were uncomfortable seeing me without breasts--where I didn't think of my body as different from my friends' bodies or needing to be explained or accounted for in any way as different from them. In other words, I had normalized my breast-less state. I forgot about my breast-less difference. I was living my life and thinking of myself as Jennifer rather than Jennifer without breasts. So there you have it. I'm sure there are going to be more moments in the future where I feel self conscious or where I second guess myself on being in a locker room. The above three milestones all occurred in very private spaces or with very close friends. But what has surprised me is how quickly I've adjusted and how I'm not sad about missing my breasts anymore. I am not glad not to have breasts, but among the things I love is not wearing a bra while jogging, not wearing a bra period....OK, so that's it. Not wearing a bra. Still, the list of things I'm sad about (sexual pleasure) is manageable (we can derive sexual pleasure in so many different ways--and honestly we are such a breast fixated nation, in some ways this is just an exercise in healthy diversity of sexual practices). This is my new normal and it feel comfortable to me.",0,1,0.10739284997563145
882,46,8,17,1,2011,2011-01-17,"Yesterday I was mistaken for a man. It happened at the Harris Teeter near Timberlyne up on MLK way. It was around 10am. I had just come from visiting Matthew at Cup of Joe and had on a Cup of Joe baseball cap (more like a Greek fisherman's cap), my flannel jacket from Nepal (it's black with multicolor bands at the wrists), and my yoga pants (which for me means my ankles are showing) with my keen slip ons. I mention this because I think if one were to see me, the entire me, there are sartorial signs that may read more as ""feminine"" than ""masculine"" or at least clothing you'd associate more with a woman (yoga pants), although I also recognize that some of my other clothing may have seemed either masculine or androgynous (baseball cap, keen shoes). The jacket probably just registered as ""ethnic."" Anyway, I was standing in line with my basket and a checker appeared and said directly to me, ""Sir, I can take you at that counter,"" pointing to the register to my left. I literally looked in back of me, wondering if perhaps I was mistaken in who he was speaking to, and then I realized that, no, it was ME, and I dutifully followed him. And then I had to make a decision: do I say something or not say something. Do I try to pass as a guy or do I let him know he's made a mistake. Since I am pretty sure that as low voiced as I *think* I am, I'm really not so low pitched as to be mistaken for a guy. I also think that upon closer inspection (like seeing the diamond wedding band that I wear or the bracelet on my wrist) the guy might realize his mistake and feel more embarrassed. So I said to him, ""Even though I know I look like a guy, I'm actually a woman."" I said this without any judgment or inflection--just stated it as matter-of-factly as I could. The checker (a college aged kid) was pretty chagrined--apologized--but I smiled and told him it was my short hair that fooled him. And he smiled, relieved, and agreed that the hair was what made him think I was a man. Which of course has led me to think about my gender identity--or the way that I present myself as a woman. Because previous to my cancer/chemo/surgery, I would have told you that I exhibit pretty masculine traits. That I liked wearing men's shirts (especially oversized white button down shirts); that I used to sing tenor parts in the chorus during high school because there weren't enough boys to sing those parts; that I have that annoying ""male"" way of interrupting people during conversations and other verbal markers that signal a more masculine rather than feminine talking style. And, in general, I just would have said that I don't *feel* very feminine. To which I now say: RUBBISH. I mean, you don't know what it's like not to feel feminine until you lose your hair and your breasts. I also think it was easy for me to say that I felt masculine, because my female identity and my hetero identity were so firmly entrenched and seemingly one and the same. In other words, I wonder to what degree it's easy for me, as a straight-identified, pre-bilateral mastectomy and pre-chemotherapy-loss-of-hair woman, to say that I identify as ""masculine"" or feel myself to have ""masculine"" traits when so many of my obvious physical features read ""feminine""--including my clothes and accessories: necklaces, rings, dresses, etc... Even more androgynous clothing like jeans or suit jackets were tailored for women rather than men--as well as my shoes--they clearly read female. Yet ever since the loss of my hair and the loss of my breasts, I've been thinking about my gender identity, in terms of my physical features. I've been wondering about what parts of me are still coded as feminine and which parts of me may truly seem to be more androgynous, more masculine. When I look at myself from the neck down wearing a t-shirt for example, I encounter a flat chest that resembles a boy's more than a woman's. And when I look at myself in the mirror, with my hair cropped close to my head, I see an uncanny resemblance to my male cousins. In fact, when I had my head shaved by Matthew back in July, my mother remarked that I in the photos I posted on this blog I looked just like my Uncle Hunter. All of which has made me realize that as much as I may look like a boy, I actually do feel like a girl (or woman rather). I actually identify, quite strongly, with being a woman--because my mannerisms, my clothing choices, my body language, my voice, are all coded as feminine and all convey a sense of my womanliness. My missing breasts didn't make me more of a woman, nor more feminine. My hair, well that's a different story. I do think that short hair plus androgynous clothing can equal gender confusion. Which may be why I'm not sure if I'll be keeping my hair short. That as much as I like to academically think about ambiguity, I'm not sure how I feel about being in an ambiguously gendered body. And yet there's a part of me that thinks that perhaps this is a time for me to explore androgyny--to explore what it means to occupy a body that is feminine without such feminine markers as longer hair and breasts. To think about what it may mean for me to either intentionally pass as male or to allow myself to be mis-read--to not have corrected the check-out clerk but to just let him make his own assumptions about who I am. Something to think about as I more through space in this new body of mine and a key question for me to wonder about is: what will I feel like wearing a summer dress? Will this be a moment when I feel the full weight of the loss of my breasts and the loss of a part of my femininity? I suppose we'll have to wait until May to find out.",0,1,0.11322381114515942
883,46,9,6,7,2012,2012-07-06,"It has been a LONG time since I've blogged on NFPR. There have been times, off and on, when I've thought about logging in and sharing a story or insight or observation. There have been moments when I've wanted to write to process what I was going through. Or to record an amusing anecdote. Or to mark an anniversary: The 2nd year anniversary of my cancer diagnosis (which is also, unfortunately, the day after my husband's birthday--it will remain unforgettable for us on many levels). The 2nd year anniversary of my port being put in. The 2nd year anniversary of when I started chemo. But, of course, I didn't. Didn't write about these milestones. Didn't commemorate them. Didn't even note them, in some cases, until after the fact. So why am I back now? Not sure. Maybe because in doing research for a chapter I'm writing on transracial/transnational adoptee blogs, I came across an essay by a theorist who works on narrative and new media, and she was writing about the gendered nature of cancer blogs. And in describing the various ""story-genres"" and purposes for which women wrote about their breast cancer (and all of the blogs she analyzed were breast cancer blogs--at least the ones written by women--she also looked at male bloggers who wrote about a variety of cancers that they were experiencing), I was reminded of my own blog--how useful and helpful it had been for me to have a place to talk about my experiences with cancer. To vent my rage and frustration and anxiety about going making treatment decisions, through chemotherapy, preparing for surgery, living without breasts, and thinking about my mortality. Recently I learned that my ex-husband's stepmother (are you following that chain?) died a year ago from ovarian cancer. She had been a breast cancer survivor. Her ovarian cancer came nearly ten years after her breast cancer diagnosis and seems to have been a result of the chemotherapy and radiation treatment that she underwent. I'm, unfortunately, no longer in touch with my ex-husband or his father/family (I learned about her passing through a mutual friend), but I felt sad and freaked out, both for her/her family and for myself. This is what having cancer does--it makes you selfish. It makes you think and wonder about whether it's going to happen to you. I mean, of course I was sorry about her passing. And it felt weird to learn about her death from someone other than my ex-husband--highlighting the estrangement from a family that I'd been married into for over a decade. But part of my sadness over her passing was also a sadness at wondering whether her fate could be my fate. Would this be my fate in another 8 years. Could I be developing cancer in my ovaries, in my uterus, as a result of the chemotherapy or just because--just because when you have cancer, there is a potential for it to spread to other parts of your body. And uterine and ovarian cancer is so difficult to detect because you can't see or feel the tumor. A week ago I was having drinks with some friends, and someone brought up the fact that she sometimes forgot that I had had cancer. I know what she means--at least, I know why she could forget. I don't talk about it very often--I mean, it doesn't really come up in everyday conversation. And there are few visual reminders. I suppose the most prominent one is that I no longer have breasts, but since I was small to begin with and since I've learned to select clothes that don't enhance my bust (or missing bustline) it's easy to forget that there's a part of me that's missing, especially now that my hair has completely grown back in (and it has grown back thicker and darker than before, if you can believe that--I have less gray hair now than I did pre-cancer--not that I ever had a lot of white hair--I inherited my father's genes for that because he didn't go gray until he turned 50 and then ""poof!"" it was all overnight). So I totally understand why my friend sometimes forgets that I have cancer, and why no one who didn't know me 2 years ago would even wonder about me and whether I'd had breast cancer because I just look like a normal, healthy woman in her early 40s (Matthew would say I look like I'm in my early 30s, but he may be looking at me with eyes of love). But I don't ever forget. And I don't mean because there's ocular evidence everytime I shower and look down at my scars. I mean because I feel like being a person with cancer--having experienced chemotherapy and the various surgeries I had related to my cancer diagnosis--that's now all a part of who I am. I think about being a person with a cancer diagnosis (notice that I still don't feel comfortable calling myself a ""survivor"") in the same way that I think about myself as a woman or as an Asian American. These identities are part of who I am in such a naturalized, almost essentialized (I use that word, hesistantly, since I'm not trying to say that there is an essentialized element or quality to being a woman or being Asian, but perhaps I don't need to be so academically cautious in this space). I've internalized having a cancer diagnosis and going through cancer treatment in the same way that I've internalized the fact that I have an Asian face. These are parts of me that just are and that are unforgettable to me. Anyway, I think it might be time for me to start writing in this space again. I needed some distance from thinking about myself in relation to my cancer. But I might be ready to start exploring some things that I've been thinking about...like what the best thing is about not having breasts (I'll save that for a future post). So if anyone is still reading this blog from its initial startup 2 years ago, thanks for being a loyal reader. And for anyone new, I hope that this blog provides some interesting insights for you, and feel free to leave a comment.",0,1,0.059711034394578706
884,48,1,10,3,2015,2015-03-10,"Dr. Susan Love published an interview on Medscape last week on the “collateral damage” of breast cancer treatments as reported by 3200 actual patients and not their doctors. She noted that doctors and patients often view things differently. For doctors, a living patient is the major sign of successful treatment. They don’t want to hear about treatment side effects that they can’t treat and cure, she says. The patients and survivors are also happy to be alive but their quality of life may be severely impaired by chemo brain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, neuropathy, and hot flashes. She calls this collateral damage rather than side effects as often these symptoms are permanent, not temporary. She doesn’t mention breasts disfigured through lumpectomy and radiation, having no. breasts at all through mastectomy, or having a bad or failed reconstruction job. Presumably, these are just the regular damage to be anticipated from breast cancer treatment. She reports that many survivors either weren’t told about these long term collateral damage effects or they were told at a time when they were so overwhelmed with other cancer information, that they were not able to absorb the message. Or if they did absorb the message, they were more concerned about staying alive than really thinking through how this collateral damage would impact their post-treatment lives. The passages of her interview that really disturbed me the most were that chemo brain and neuropathy were forever. They don’t get better. You just get used to them and find your new normal. In other words, you stay numb and dumb forever. She could have added depression, anxiety, PTSD, and impaired body image to this list as they are often long lasting, sometimes forever. I admit to being one of those who were told the “side effects” of chemotherapy (at least the second time around) and it was a blur of nightmare words and images ending with the ultimate side effect of death. Everything else was forgotten the moment it left the oncologist’s mouth. Thank God I took notes. But nothing in my notes said that chemo brain and neuropathy were forever. Or that I would eventually wind up with PTSD and free falling panic attacks. Chemo brain was supposed to end with chemo. Neuropathy was supposed to eventually go away. And no one told me just how bad a reconstruction job could be. So bad, that even oncologists and their nurses urged me to find a new plastic surgeon and get it fixed. I eventually did but after about 7 years, the implant inside the flap became encapsulated with scar tissue and is now a hard ball that juts off to the left of my body. My newest plastic surgeon is afraid to operate again for fear the whole reconstruction will collapse. So I walk around with a badly reconstructed left side and a right side that should have had the permanent implant put in it 3 years ago, dragging my feet about signing up for more surgery that will result in 2 mismatched breasts or even worse, 2 matching deformed breasts. I had a male colleague at work whose wife had breast cancer shortly after I had my reconstruction revised. I even referred them to the plastic surgeon who performed the same back flap surgery with silicone implant that I had. I remember sitting in his office 2 years after her surgery and listening to him complain how he could no longer make love to his wife as the surgery had left her “a hideous grotesque monster”. He was generally a very kind man and I think for a moment he forgot that I too had the same surgery. My smile froze on my face and I quietly left the room, stung to the core. It quickly put me in my place that no matter how much better the fake breast looked than before the revision, in some men’s eyes, I would always look like a hideous grotesque monster. Yes, body image issues are forever after breast cancer. I should note that he left his wife shortly after this conversation and is now remarried to a normal 2 breasted woman. From the Facebook groups I belong to, it seems many marriages end after a breast cancer diagnosis. So do many friendships. More collateral damage to add to the list? I had dealt with chemo brain before way back in 1994 when it was a slang term that patients used but wasn’t really acknowledged by doctors as a true medical condition. I had short term memory loss and word problems way back then but I seemed to be back to normal 18 months post-chemo. Ten years later, I woke up one morning with 2 fingers in my left hand permanently numb although I didn’t know it was permanent at the time. The neurologist couldn’t find anything with his shock tests so I was sent for a brain MRI. All hell broke loose then when it showed that my brain seemed shrunken (now a recognized piece of collateral damage from chemotherapy) and was covered in white spots consistent with multiple sclerosis but in the wrong parts of the brain. I still spent 3 years at the ms clinic waiting for more symptoms or for my MRI to change. Finally, I was told it wasn’t ms and then spent the next 2 years seeing every medical expert in town for a cause for my numb fingers and unusual brain MRIs. Someone suggested it could be a late arising radiation symptom. No one ever suggested it was from chemotherapy. I still don’t have a definitive answer but I truly believe the numbness and the weird brain MRIs are collateral damage from my first 2 cancer treatments, involving both radiation and chemotherapy. Given that the condition has remained permanent for the last 10 years, I suspect my neuropathy is forever. And no, I’ve never gotten used to it or found my “new normal” in dealing with it. It makes me angry and frustrated that these symptoms showed up years after active cancer treatment. What other long-term “gifts” does cancer have in store for me down the road? I had chemotherapy again in 2011. Suddenly chemo brain was a real condition that oncologists talked about seriously. I don’t recall being told that it could be a permanent condition. For me, the chemo brain has in fact improved significantly but it still rears its ugly head in times of stress or fatigue (and sometimes for no discernable reason at all). It seems to have stabalized about a year ago and I always assumed it would keep getting better as time went by. But now reading that chemo brain can be forever, I am left wondering if this is as good as it gets. Will I always be plagued with a brain and tongue that don’t connect or a brain that has much poorer short term memory than it did before the second chemo? Some women have written in the comments to this blog that they suffer from radiation brain with the same symptoms as chemo brain. God help me if this is true, as I have been radiated twice along with my 2 bouts of chemotherapy. My brain must be the size of a peanut by now, covered with even more white spots and less grey matter. It is clear that research money has to go into ways of dealing with the collateral damage breast cancer treatments leave behind as well as trying to prevent the damage from happening in the first place. We don’t need more awareness of breast cancer. Everyone is aware. We don’t need to use race money to fund more races. We need to find ways to help with these survivorship issues. And even more importantly, we need research money for a cure for metastic breast cancer, the only breast cancer that actually kills.

885,48,10,15,1,2015,2015-01-15,"I I was first diagnosed with breast cancer at 29. February,2015 will be 27 years from the time of my first diagnosis. I have spent almost half my life battling breast cancer. “Finding your new normal” is one of those popular buzz phrases spoken by oncologists, counsellors, and other cancer survivors. I’ve always felt that this word was like a password to a secret clubhouse that everyone in Cancerland belongs to except for me. Although I know this password, I am obviously missing something that would allow me to gain entry. Maybe a special knock or a secret handshake is also required. While I can spout the phrase “new normal” without difficulty, I’ve never quite understood how those words applied to my life. If we uttered the phrase “changes to your life” due to cancer, I could easily relate to that. I could draw up a long list of the ways my life changed with the first diagnosis,the first and second mastectomy,the bad reconstruction job,the repeated bouts of cancer,and the discovery that I lived for 16 years under the illusion I was BRCA negative when in fact I was BRCA1 positive all the time. Maybe I have problems relating to the word “normal”. The changes that happened to my mind, body, and emotions were anything but “normal” as we usually think of the term. Losing my breasts, lymph nodes,fertility,and ovaries may be normal for BRCA positive cancer survivors and previvors but there is nothing normal about that in terms of the population at large. Being diagnosed with 3 separate breast cancers at 29, 34,and 36 is statistically improbable in the breast cancer world. Having a fourth breast cancer at 52 puts me into a rare category that very few breast cancer patients attain (or would want to attain). Top that off with all 4 cancers being of the triple negative variety (not influenced by hormones) which is a reasonably rare breast cancer, and there is very little that is normal about my world. If we are talking about acknowledging that these things happened to me and that they form part of my present reality, I can do that. Have I fully accepted, embraced, and integrated these changes into my life in a positive and life-affirming manner? Uh no. Although I can be happy and positive much of the time, I am not happy that I had to go through these events at such a young age. I’m also not happy that I had to have my cancer come back over and over and over again. This is my life, this is my reality, this is my world but there is nothing normal about it. And there is little I can do to normalize my experiences so that they make some sort of sense in the context of the rest of my life. I try to think back to what my old normal was. I was an only child who spent the first 12 years of her childhood growing up in a typical suburban neighborhood. My parents and I attended Baptist church every Sunday and my parents were complete tee-totalers. This “normal” existence underwent a dramatic change in 8th grade when my father went from complete tee-totaler to a full blown raging alcoholic and valium addict in the course of one year. My world was completely turned upside down and I had no idea how to deal with this “new normal”. My father’s alcoholism progressed with great speed and his moods veered between sickeningly sentimental and raging mad, with very little in between. My lifelong battle with anxiety and depression started in the 8th grade and progressively got worse throughout high school. My mother felt the best way to protect me was to get me out of the house as soon as I graduated high school. We lived in a university town so we planned to find a major that wasn’t offered locally. We hit on Criminology as it was only available 1000 miles a way. Not the best way to plan for your future education, but it achieved its purpose and I was able to leave home at 17. The next 12 years were the college and early employment years. I attained my BA in Criminology, gained some work experience as a probation officer, went back to university to complete law school and spent a grueling year articling (similar to interning) with a large law firm in Vancouver. I had dated widely, fallen madly in love at least twice, broken a few hearts and had mine broken in return. I never doubted that I would have a law career or that I would marry and raise a family. Those were the fun years filled with plans, hopes, and dreams about the future. After the chaos of growing up in an alcoholic home, I loved my fun filled yet hard working “new normal”. On the eve of my entry into the legal profession, I had my first cancer diagnosis. It changed me in ways that still affect me today. The career was put on hold. The doctors said no pregnancies for 5 years or else I would die, so marriage and a family were put on hold as well. Although I only had a lumpectomy and radiation, I developed major body image issues as I knew no one even remotely in my age group who had a weird looking mismatched breast. I became shy about dating, not knowing when to break it to them that I had undergone breast cancer treatment. So dating was also put on hold. Fear,anxiety,and social unease became my constant companions after that first diagnosis and continue to haunt me today. Is this considered my first experience with cancer’s “new normal”? I still believed that being cancer free for 5 years meant you were cured. Over that first 5 year period, I did launch my law career and began dating again. I was offered a promotion and a move to a new city hours before I went for my 5 year mammogram. I told my employer that I would be back shortly, that this mammogram was just a formality, as all prior mammograms had been clear. Unfortunately for me, this mammogram showed cancer again and a mastectomy and 9 months of chemotherapy were my only options. Good-bye promotion. Good-bye new city. And the 5 year no pregnancy rule started from scratch all over again. I was off work for 18 months. I had lost my last illusion about being cured of cancer. Where the first cancer had brought fear and self-doubt into my life, the second cancer brought a kind of craziness. The world which I always believed was a fair and orderly place, became chaotic and events seemed completely random. Whether I lived or died seemed completely out of my control. Any plans I tried to make for my future seemed to be quashed as soon as they were made. It was clear that there were many things my oncologists did not know, many questions they could not answer. I felt a lot of confusion. It seemed that whenever fate was about to give me a big break, cancer re-entered the picture to turn my dreams to dust. Was this feeling of hopelessness and helplessness my “new normal” for my second cancer? I had reconstruction surgery which looked bad even from the start. Even doctors and nurses at the Cancer Clinic would comment that I should see another plastic surgeon to try to fix it. My breast resembled a lumpy flattened pancake but as it had taken a long time to heal, I wasn’t eager to go under the knife again. My body image issues and self-consciousness grew considerably worse. 18 months after returning to work, a new cancer was found in the remaining breast. I had a new surgeon who said doctors had recently abandoned the 5 year pregnancy rule and that if I wanted a child, I should hurry up as I was already 36 and could have early ovarian failure due to the chemotherapy. I got married and we soon found ourselves at a fertility clinic. 2 rounds of IVF were unsuccessful so we formulated a Plan B. We started the adoption process and a year later, we had a handsome baby boy. 16 months after that, we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. I took one of the early BRCA tests and was declared BRCA negative. Life was good. Until one day it wasn’t. The marriage imploded, I was blindsided,and I was left as a single Mom to a 22 month old toddler and a six month old baby. Once again, my hopes and dreams were shattered and life seemed as random and arbitrary as it had during my second cancer. The years went by, the kids kept growing, and the cancer stayed away. After 16 cancer free years, the cancer came back. I was looking at another mastectomy and more chemotherapy. Only this time around, there were children involved, ages 9 and 11. This time I really was afraid of dying as I didn’t want them to lose their mother at such young ages. The kids were scared too but wouldn’t really say so. My son wanted me to appear as normal as possible and not look like a cancer patient. He wanted me in a wig and full make-up 24/7 (didn’t happen). My daughter would feel sick with vague symptoms on chemo days or oncology visits. She wanted to accompany me to all these appointments as that seemed to make her feel more secure. It was another crazy hysterical chaotic year but we muddled through it somehow. After cancer 4, I was encouraged to retake the BRCA test as it was now looking at things it hadn’t looked for originally. Suddenly, I was BRCA1 positive and at high risk for ovarian cancer. There was a great rush to have my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed as soon as possible. With Cancer 4, I became a bit of a medical curiosity given that I was BRCA1 positive, had an aggressive grade of an aggressive cancer, and had survived for so long without the cancer metastasizing outside my breasts. At work,things were looked at somewhat differently. Between the cancers and the 2 adoption leaves, my coworkers saw me as someone who was rarely at work. The office atmosphere was decidedly chilly upon my return from Cancer 4. My self-esteem was plummeting, I still had side effects from chemo brain, and I started feeling incompetent in a job I had held for 25 years. A year ago, I took a medical leave and have since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. My “newest new normal” now has a mixed diagnosis of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I no longer plan too far ahead for fear of jinxing any happy days that lay ahead. I worry about my children’s future – who will love them and look after them if I am gone? At the same time, I am forever grateful that I get to be their Mom. I try to live each day as if it may be my last. Is this the “new normal” everyone talks about? Is it some combination of hard lessons learned and the feeling of walking on a trapeeze with no safety net underneath? The feeling that my luck will once again run out and I will be forced to take another spin on the Cancer Roulette Wheel of Fortune? Is it all those scary feelings combined with a fierce protective love for my children that keeps me going forward each day? What does the “new normal” of cancer feel like to you? Have I completely missed the boat on this one? Is it supposed to be a positive thing or a negative thing? I really would like to hear your thoughts in the comments below.

886,48,11,7,1,2015,2015-01-07,"Dear Sharon, I am here with you on this February morning of 1988, watching you sleep. I am taken aback not just by your youthful appearance but by a look on your face I haven’t seen in years. Even in sleep, your face shows a look of optimism and blind faith that everything in your life will turn out alright. You still innocently believe that the universe is a fair and orderly place where good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. I wonder if this is the last time you will ever look like this or if it takes a few more days or weeks for that innocence to disappear forever. You think you are going through a rough patch right now due to recent personal losses. By the time this day is over, the break-up with your boyfriend and the lay-off from your job will be the least of your worries Your big plan for the morning is to get onto the typewriter and prepare cover letters for your resume so you can end this spell of unemployment. But your plans are about to change in four…three…two…one. Good! You are awake. Time to stretch your arms overhead and accidentally touch your left breast. Ah…do you feel it? You have had lumps and bumps in your breasts before but this one feels somehow different. You touch it again, this time deliberately, and then touch the other breast for comparison’s sake. There is nothing at all similar anywhere else in either breast. Watching your face, I see your eyes grow wider and a mixture of fear and confusion crosses your face. I watch you hesitate and then reach for your address book that contains your doctor’s phone number. I watch you talking to the receptionist and see the surprise in your face when she tells you there has been a cancellation and the doctor can see you in an hour. There is no time to think. You are still telling yourself that you are bothering the doctor over nothing. Everyone knows 29 year olds don’t get breast cancer. They don’t get breast cancer at 29 even if their mother battled both breast and ovarian cancer in the last decade. Breast cancer is for menopausal women not young women in their 20’s. Part of you wants to call the office back to cancel the appointment. I am here to whisper to you that this is one appointment you must keep. Not really knowing why, you find yourself at the doctor’s office waiting to be examined. The doctor said it will probably just be a cyst but given your family history, it is good that you came to have it checked out. You note the doctor’s smiling face turn into a frown as she feels the lump for herself. There is a hospital across the street from her office and she makes arrangements for you to see a breast surgeon that very afternoon. She explains that he will try to drain the lump with a needle and if it is a fluid filled cyst, it will collapse and that will be the end of the matter. You notice that she is smiling too brightly and talking a bit too fast. I see the shadows of fear and doubt starting to take root on your face. As much as I would like to tell you that everything will be okay, I know how this part of the story ends. I can only whisper to you again that this is yet another appointment you can’t afford to miss. I can read your thoughts. You feel like time is moving way too fast. The day’s events are hurtling forward like an out of control train on a too short track. You cross the street and wait to see the breast surgeon. You wonder what it feels like to have a needle stuck in your breast. You don’t have long to wonder. You are disrobing yet again and having your second breast examination of the day. Once again you see the doctor frown when his hand examines your lump. He takes out a needle and thrusts it into your breast. When he withdraws it, you note that it is not filled with fluid. It is not a cyst. It is solid. Just watching you, I can see the anxiety solidifying on your face and I can almost feel your stomach dropping in fear. You are sent to another floor for your first mammogram. It hurts, particularly after just having been subjected to the needle. When you return to the surgeon’s office, he tells you a surgical biopsy will be required to tell if it is benign or cancerous. There is a deadly silence after the cancer word is spoken. You find yourself asking the doctor what he thinks it is. As soon as you say those words aloud, you want to take them back. You don’t want to hear his answer. He tells you only a biopsy can truly determine if it is cancerous but then adds that the physical exam and the mammogram are highly suggestive of a malignant tumor. You don’t hear a word he says after that although you do manage to stumble to the receptionist’s desk to book a biopsy appointment in a few days time. You slowly walk back towards your apartment, unaware of the tears flowing down your cheeks. A random man calls out to you not to cry, no guy is worth your tears. This makes you cry harder and you race home to avoid any further attention. All you want is to talk to your Mom and have her hold you. She lives 500 miles away so a long distance call will have to do. I look closely at your face. Your eyes have the startled look of a deer caught in the headlights. The blind faith optimism has vanished from your face, never to return again. You know you have breast cancer even though it hasn’t been officially diagnosed yet. You want to know what happens next, how you will ever go on. I came from the future to answer your questions and reassure you that there will still be good times ahead. But how can I tell you that this won’t be your last cancer? How do I say that it will come back again and again and again? Even I don’t know the final ending to our story. I look at your shattered face and do not think you could handle the news of all the challenges that lie ahead of you. It will be easier for you to just live and survive them one by one the way I did. So I will rip up this letter I have been writing to you as I think it would do more harm than good. I wish there was some way to let you know that there is happiness ahead as well as pain but I can’t tell you about one without telling you about the other. I would love to restore the unthinking optimism to your face but I know it is gone for good. For us, the universe is a disorderly random place where bad things can happen to good people. Just know that you are going to live at least 26 more years and that you will get to be a mother to 2 children you will love very much. It is going to take a very long time for you to come to peaceful terms with yourself but I guarantee it will happen. Good-bye for now old friend. Please forget I ever was here whispering in your ear. Just know my whispers saved your life this time. Sharon Greene January 8, 2015 Age 56 Posted from WordPress for Android Sh Tweet Like this: Like Loading...",0,1,0.09214596127386825
887,48,12,3,1,2015,2015-01-03,"When you are a parent, you want to protect your children from all the bad things in life as you love them so fiercely. You feel like this lioness with her cub, trying to shelter them from all impending harm. But when you are diagnosed with cancer, you are the one that sends your children’s world into a chaotic tailspin. Between the shock of diagnosis, the demands of treatment, and the uncertainty of what the future holds for you and your family, your children can’t help but be threatened by this disease that has invaded their lives. Although I have had breast cancer 4 times, I only had children during the last bout in 2011. At that time, they were 9 and 11, old enough to understand what was going on but young enough that they still needed a parent who could be there for them 24/7. As a single mother with no other family for support, I found the competing demands of parenthood vs the painful realities of illness very overwhelming. My children knew since a very young age that I had cancer 3 times way back before they were born. They were perversely proud of this fact about me as I guess it made them think I was Wonder Woman, able to beat cancer into submission at a single bound. When after being cancer free for 16 years I learned it was back, I panicked about how I would explain this to my son and daughter. I had no idea how we would manage as in the past there was always someone around to take care of me. This time I was their caretaker and no one was volunteering to look after me (or them). The children knew something was wrong before I was ready to have the cancer discussion. There were too many doctor’s appointments, too many whispered phone calls, and a few too many tears shed watching children’s television shows that weren’t particularly sad or sentimental. When your Mom bursts into tears over Sponge Bob’s latest escapade, the children fear the worst is about to happen. When they asked if they had done something to make Mommy so sad all the time, I knew I had to tell them the truth. I did a little research on how to talk to your school age children about a cancer diagnosis. The articles mainly touch on three points which have been called the 3 “c” words. The first point is to call it cancer, not a generic sickness or a boo boo. The reasoning is that if they have a name and explanation of what your condition is, they will be less likely to worry about other more horrendous illnesses (maybe Ebola?) you may have. It helps as well for them to associate a specific term for the disease as they may become overly fearful of the word, “sick” as it applies to them. If they associate the word “sick” with Mommy having major surgery and going bald they may panic when someone calls them sick when they complain of a tummy ache or a sore throat. They may think their sickness may lead to the same extreme consequences that happened to Mommy. So instead of turning your children into hypochondriacs by using the word “sickness”, use the word “cancer” so they can differentiate between the two conditions. This was the easy part for me. My children knew what cancer was because of my past history. On the other hand, they had never lived through it before and needed some explanations of the possible treatments that might be involved and the consequences of those. My 11 year old son became fixated on the fact that I would lose my hair and that seemingly was his greatest concern throughout my treatment. Talking to him about my cancer now 4 years later, he admits he was secretly worried sick I would die and leave him. But it was safer for him to worry outwardly about my baldness, wanting me to wear a wig, even to sleep. My little caps and turbans were disturbing to him (let alone my bald head) even in the privacy of our own home. My 9 year old daughter took my baldness and various head coverings in stride. She loved coming with me to the Cancer Clinic where free donated wigs and head coverings were there to try on and take home. She became my fashion co-ordinator, ensuring my hat matched my outfit. She showed her discomfort about my cancer in other ways. For example, she would often feign sickness on my chemo days or at times I had oncology appointments. She knew I considered her too young to leave at home alone so she would often accompany me to these appointments. This was her way of exerting control of the situation. She seemed to think that if I went to a hospital alone, they would keep me and I would never return home. Even though I strongly suspected her vague symptoms of illness were fake, it was clear that her distress levels were real. Taking her along to these appointments reduced her anxiety while insisting she attend school led to huge emotional meltdowns every time. It seemed the lesser of the two evils at the time although in hindsight, it would have been better for her education if I had a back-up person to send her to on those appointment days. My guess is that she would have recovered from her symptoms quickly and attended school to be with her friends. While neither child ever actively worried aloud in my presence that they were afraid I was going to die, 4 years later it is clear that was underlying their behaviour all along. The second “c” word recommended to be included in any discussion of cancer with children is the word “contagious”. It is important that children know they will not catch cancer from you in the same way they could catch a cold. This encourages continued close contact like hugs and kisses, without the child worrying they too will become sick. My children seemed to readily understand this concept and were not afraid of physical contact with me. The only times physical contact became a challenge were after the mastectomy and partial reconstruction, when I returned home sore with 3 drains hanging down. They had to be reminded that Mommy loved them but couldn’t tolerate a big bear hug quite yet. The other times physical contact became an issue were during chemo when they had a cold or flu and they were the contagious ones. They had to be reminded that my immune system was weak and if I caught their bug, I could get very sick. They seemed to accept that without question. I was the one who suffered guilt from not being able to care for them as a mother should when some bug got them down. The third “c” word is “causation” in that Mommy’s cancer was not caused by anything her children did. The experts say that children under 13 are still in a developmental stage where they may blame themselves when something bad happens in the family. They may think that Mommy got cancer because I always nag her for new toys or because I don’t clean my room when she tells me to. I did reassure my children that they did not cause my cancer in any way. They both looked at me blankly as if the thought had never crossed their minds. That may be explainable by their knowledge that I had breast cancer 3 times before they were born. If they didn’t cause the first 3, why on earth would they think they caused the fourth cancer? To help my children better understand my illness and their feelings about it, I brought home every age appropriate, “when your parent has cancer” book the Cancer Clinic had available. Although both enjoy reading, neither child showed any interest in the books even when I said we could look at them together. Maybe they thought we have to live with this stuff everyday, why would we want to read about it too? Some cancer centers have programs specifically for children with parents living with cancer. We attended a half day program which the kids enjoyed very much as they saw others their own age living with a parent like myself. My daughter and I attended a Look Good, Feel Good program where we got to play around with and take home various cosmetics and wigs. My daughter decided I needed a purple wig to liven up my appearance so I would sometimes wear it at home for fun. This drove my son crazy as while he wanted me in a wig at all times, I was only supposed to wear wigs that were of the same color and style as my natural hair. Trying to be a parent with cancer is challenging at best, although some of the sweetest memories of my life come from that period. Sometimes a simple caring gesture or word from one of my children would be enough to lift my mood for days on end. We did still manage to have birthday parties and a few fun outings during this year. Even at my sickest, when I was hospitalized for 4 days a week after my first chemo, the children got to spend one night with me in a private hospital room, a fun first for both of them. Unfortunately, between the chemo brain and the PTSD, much of the year of Cancer 4 is a hazy blur to me. My children remember it better than I do. If I had to relive that experience again, I would seek out more support for both myself and the children. I also would have looked into one of the free camps for cancer families as we all needed a vacation after the previous year. They are just starting up in Canada but there are several established places in the US we might have qualified for had I known about them at the time. While parenting with cancer can be tough going at times, especially for a single parent, it is doable as long as you can let go of your expectations of what perfect family life is supposed to look like. Sometimes a picnic on the floor altogether as a family can be more fun and memorable than a standard dinner at 5:00 gathered around the kitchen table. It’s your cancer, your family, and your lives together that determine how you best muddle through this difficult family time.

892,48,17,16,12,2014,2014-12-16,"A breast cancer diagnosis is a life altering event, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. Surprisingly, little attention has been devoted to conducting scientific studies that measure anxiety, depression, and PTSD rates in first time breast cancer patients. Even less scientific attention has been paid to these psychological effects in patients who have experienced a recurrence or a metastasis of their cancer. The statistics available are all over the map but it can safely be said that almost all breast cancer patients will suffer from depression and high anxiety levels sometime on their journey from diagnosis to post-treatment. These feelings may be short-term for many, disappearing within a few months after treatment ends. A significant percentage of first time breast cancer survivors (US studies say 25% while European and Australian studies say at least 50%) will go on to develop long term post-traumatic stress disorder. There is very little statistical evidence pinpointing the rates of depression and PTSD in women with breast cancer recurrences but an 80% combined severe depression and/or PTSD rate has been cited in some articles. For the stage 4 patient, it is frequently noted that the depression and PTSD rates are “very high,” which really isn’t all that surprising. While the scientific studies are few and far between, it is stated repeatedly in the cancer literature that most of us will have to deal with these negative emotions some time along our journey. Drs. have long recognized that a cancer diagnosis is a huge emotional blow to their patients. Just the very word “cancer” strikes the fear of disfigurement, a shortened life span, and a slow painful death into the hearts of most of us. Anti-anxiety medications such as Ativan or Xanax are often prescribed to the newly diagnosed and prescriptions are freely refilled during treatment and for a short time thereafter. The cancer diagnosis may be given in person or over the phone, depending on your doctor. If it’s over the phone and you have paper and pen ready, you may have some recollection of the finer points of the doctor’s call when you hang up. Or maybe not. My first diagnosis was over the phone and while I wrote notes as a rush of medical jargon came my way, all that was written on my page was “breast cancer” about eleven times, in increasingly larger letters. I didn’t even manage to write down my next appointment and had to call his office back to find out what I was supposed to do next. My mind felt like a sieve in the early days of my first diagnosis as I could not seem to retain anything but the most basic information. At other times, I felt like I was having a weird out of body experience, somehow removed from all that was happening around me. I guess the shock of having your whole world turned upside down in a moment creates chaos in your brain. I strongly recommend taking a tape recorder and/or another person with you to the surgeon’s and oncologist’s office for your visits. The amount of information given is too much to absorb on your own, let alone process and act upon. Some doctors will explain things in plain English while others may use medical terms in a way you don’t understand. Even a diagnosis such as “triple negative breast cancer” will leave you staring blankly if you have never heard the words “triple” and “negative” applied to breast cancer before. It feels as though you have to learn another language just to understand what is going on in your body. The worst part is that before you have even mastered the fundamentals of this new language, doctors are asking you to make many impossible decisions and to make them quickly. The diagnostic period and the treatment planning time are among the most confusing and stressful parts of the cancer process. Not only are you reeling from the shock of learning you have cancer, you are given a huge amount of unpleasant choices to make, any of which have the potential to change the whole course of your life. Do you want a lumpectomy with radiation, a single mastectomy, or a double mastectomy? Chemotherapy before or after surgery or no chemotherapy at all? If you choose chemotherapy, here are the risks and benefits of each type we could offer you. One can cause long term heart problems and the other increases your risk of uterine and bladder cancer. Which would you prefer? Do you want immediate reconstruction or do you want skip that and use prostheses or would you rather be fabulously flat? If you choose reconstruction, do you want implants or surgery that uses your stomach, back muscles, or buttocks to create a new breast? Is genetic testing necessary? If you test positive for a genetic cancer, do you want your ovaries removed now or later? All these decisions and more have to be made in a short period of time while you are still reeling from emotional shock, not fully absorbing all the information being thrown your way. It’s a wonder any of us stick around the doctor’s office long enough to make any decision, informed or otherwise! The initial diagnostic period also involves further scans and tests to determine if you are one of the 10% of first time patients whose cancer has already spread from the breast to another part of the body. The testing portion of this period can bring on intense feelings of fear, worry, and depression as you have no idea whether the cancer has already travelled past the breast and into your bones, lungs, liver, or brain. The whole pre-treatment process takes on an air of unreality as only a short time ago you were blissfully unaware that you were even sick. Is that really you rejoicing over clear scans and hearing yourself agreeing to amputation of part or all of your breast(s) followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation? I swear cancer never felt real to me until the first moment I would wake up in the recovery room after surgery, moaning for a shot of morphine. With surgical pain, cancer got real very quickly (and yes I felt this way all 4 times). Each patient has their own way of coping with the physical realities of surgery and other treatment. Some women move quickly from shock into fighting mode, telling themselves and their loved ones they will beat cancer and kick it’s butt into the ground. Some women place their faith in God to get them through the hard times. Others adopt a strategy of trying to always find the positive or the humorous side of cancer. Others just get plain angry at the Universe, fate, or God. All these coping strategies can be helpful during treatment as they may provide the motivation to continue with chemo or radiation even when your body is weary and just wants the treatment to be over with NOW. Some people can stay in one particular emotional mode throughout the treatment process. Most of us flit in and out of various modes, one day feeling like a tough warrior and the next feeling like a fragile bird with a broken wing. There are those who struggle with debilitating depression and anxiety throughout the treatment process. They may have to force themselves to continue treatment when the going gets rough. They may question if they are putting themselves through the pain of chemotherapy or radiation for a cancer that may recur or metastisize anyway, regardless of what they do. They may feel overwhelmed, sad, and stressed most of the time. If you are feeling severely depressed, it may be that you are lacking a strong support system. If you can reach out to family, friends, a church or a counsellor for help, it may make life easier to deal with. If the depression is persistent and is interfering with your life, please consider psychiatric intervention and possibly a prescription for antidepressants. The treatment period can heighten feelings of depression through a combination of physical and emotional factors. One of the key features of all the treatment methods is that they bring on severe fatigue which can quickly lead to emotional exhaustion. Getting out of bed, showering, and eating breakfast can feel as exhausting as a full day of physical labour. Throw a couple of children and pets into the mix and you are drained of all energy by 9:00 am. There are also the emotional stresses of dealing with a radically changed body from surgery and hair loss from chemotherapy. This plays havoc with your self-image and self-esteem as you wonder where the woman you used to look like a few months ago has gone. With your bald head, lack of eyelashes and eyebrows and whatever surgery was done to your body, you may feel she has no hope of ever coming back. The physical changes are difficult at any age but seem to be harder for young single breast cancer patients to handle. The literature notes that the young, the single, and the poor have the highest rates of depression and PTSD following a breast cancer diagnosis. Depending on where you live, there may be financial pressures if you don’t have adequate health insurance or if you have to quit your job as paid sick leave is not offered. If you are a single parent with little support, every day can feel like one long endless challenge. Coping with cancer treatments and chemobrain simultaneously can leave you feeling helpless as your short term memory fades and you find yourself literally at a loss for words as the connection between the thoughts in your head and what comes out of your mouth seems to be irreparably broken. I remember bursting into tears several times trying unsuccessfully to express a simple sentence. At times I thought the cancer had spread to my brain as I was constantly forgetting where I had left my keys, purse, or phone and I often didn’t have the words to express to others what the problem was. Even though my doctors said it was chemo brain that was responsible for my memory and language problems, at times I thought I was losing my mind. Or that at the very least, I had suffered a stroke or was experiencing early onset Alzheimer’s symptoms. A very vulnerable time for breast cancer survivors is when treatment ends and they stop being patients who see their medical team on a regular basis. Some of the women who spent their time in treatment being fighters or being angry or being positive come crashing down the hardest when treatment ends. I have heard women describing themselves as feeling lost and not knowing what to do next once that last chemotherapy or radiology session they were so looking forward to has come to an end. After all these months of anticipating the end of treatment, the actual ending seems anti-climatic yet frightening at the same time. For many women, the end of treatment is when depression truly hits them. Their pre-cancer life is gone forever as they have faced their own mortality head on. There is no turning back the clock and regaining the innocence they have lost. At the same time, their identity as a cancer patient has come to an abrupt end and they must face their inner fears of a recurrence or a Stage 4 diagnosis alone, without the support of their medical team. This transition time is very hard for many women. They reached their goal to finish treatment but they don’t have a new tangible goal to strive towards. Others around them impatiently wonder when they are going to resume their old activities and lifestyle. Their family and friends may begin to withdraw the emotional and physical support they offered during treatment as they expect the woman to bounce back to normal in a week or two, or maybe a month tops. The survivor may feel misunderstood by everyone, including herself. She may wonder how she could stay so positive through treatment and then be hit hard with depression when the treatment ends. Cancer treatment is a physically and emotionally draining experience and it is unrealistic to think that everything will be back to normal as soon as the last treatment session ends. It takes a long time for your body and mind to recover from the trauma of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. As doctors tell their patients to find their new normal, it may be impossible to return to the days of the old normal. Priorities may have changed significantly in the year or so that has passed since they were first diagnosed with cancer. Returning to the old normal may not be an appealing option anymore. The emotional trauma experienced after a cancer recurrence or a Stage 4 diagnosis takes even longer to process than a first time diagnosis. When cancer spreads or comes back, you can no longer tell yourself that if I make it 5 years, I will be cured. It becomes clear that cancer doesn’t play by the rules, at least not for everyone. When the 5 year magic cure rule is broken, many illusions that gave hope the first time are shattered forever. You no longer believe that medical science has all the answers, especially if your cancer was caught early and your prognosis was excellent. You become aware that cancer can come back again at any time or can continue to spread throughout your body even when it has been aggressively treated. You will never feel safe that this time it is gone for good, no matter how much you change your diet or make other changes to your lifestyle. You will probably continue to do everything in your power to extend your life span but you will know in the back of your mind that cancer can change the rules of the game at any time. These realizations help explain why so many women in these situations suffer severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The universe is not unfolding as it should. It is unfolding in a way that makes little sense to us mere mortals. This is not to say that all is doom and gloom for any breast cancer patient or survivor. Most patients do recover their emotional equilibrium relatively quickly. Cancer may have made them aware of their own mortality sooner than they expected but there is still plenty of joy to be found in day to day living. There may be a greater appreciation for family and good friends. We may feel more grateful for the little pleasures in life that we once took for granted. The little things that used to drive us crazy may no longer even make a dent on our emotional radar. They say don’t sweat the small stuff. After cancer, most of our minor annoyances definitely turn out to be small stuff. Those of us who suffer from PTSD may face a tougher road back to regain our positive psychological health. We may look fine on the outside, return to full- time employment, and make every effort to get on with our lives but the emotional quality of our lives may still be wounded and damaged. Some of the signs that you may be suffering from PTSD are: flashbacks or nightmares about cancer or treatment, blanking out and forgetting important parts of the cancer process, feeling emotionally numb, feeling continually hopeless and helpless, loss of enjoyment in activities that used to bring you pleasure, suicidal thoughts, and being hyper-sensitive to anything that reminds you of your cancer or its treatment. The advice given by the Mayo Clinic is that if these feelings persist and are interfering with your life, you should seek professional help at the earliest opportunity before the symptoms become further entrenched and harder to treat. To minimize psychological distress no matter where you are in your cancer journey, using self care techniques will make the process easier. Activities that promote relaxation such as meditation, yoga, or massage can help you deal with stress. Having someone to talk to, whether it is a friend, family member, or a professional will help with sorting through the difficult feelings you may be experiencing. Finally, an in person or online support group with other women going through cancer can help you to see you are not alone and that there are others who understand exactly what you are feeling. Sometimes just knowing that your feelings are shared by many other women across the world can help you feel normal in the very unnormal world of cancer.

893,48,18,10,12,2014,2014-12-10,"It is almost that time of year again. The shopping malls have been decorated for Christmas since Halloween. Almost every radio station is playing Christmas music around the clock. If you have young children, they are excitedly waiting for Santa to come and visit. If you have preteens or teenagers, they are preparing their holiday wish lists and fully expecting Mom to buy them every item, no matter how high the cost. Christmas movies paint a serene picture of the family hanging stockings together, opening the perfect presents (no socks or underwear) under a magnificent Christmas tree, and gathering together at a table groaning under the weight of every food imaginable. Some families probably do have Disney worthy Christmases but for most of us, there are some less than picture perfect moments. I recall Christmases where my daughter was so excited, she threw up under the Christmas tree. Then there were the Christmases of my youth where people would start drinking too early and by dinnertime would be rude and belligerent. (This was also usually accompanied by someone throwing up). The presents were often bought during the peak of the holiday shopping season in understaffed stores filled with testy shoppers, creating huge amounts of stress. The feast on the table was often prepared by one woman, usually Mom, who baked cookies for weeks and was up at the crack of dawn preparing the turkey and side dishes. The poor woman was so exhausted by dinnertime that she couldn’t even enjoy the food she had so painstakingly prepared. These less than perfect holiday moments can be enough to throw a healthy person into a tizzy. Now throw breast cancer into the mix and it is easy to understand why many patients and survivors dread the winter holiday season. It isn’t just Christmas or Hanukkah that bring forth these feelings of anxiety and dread. Thanksgiving, children’s birthday parties, New Year’s Eve, and anniversaries can also be difficult times for patients, survivors, and their families. Although this post focuses on Christmas, it is called “happy holidays” for non-politically correct reasons. The issues outlined below can surface on any special event where people are supposed to be celebrating with others and the expectation is that everyone is filled with happiness and joy. If life was fair, cancer would be diagnosed or treated on a calendar system in which these events would only occur at the least stressful times of the year. I was going to say they would only occur at a convenient time but there is no convenient time of the year to have cancer. Unfortunately, people receive cancer diagnoses or news of recurrences or metastases year round, including right before the Christmas season (or other important events). The shock of receiving this kind of news makes it difficult to want to celebrate and be festive with distant relatives or friends. As well as trying to process the bad news, there is often a sense of guilt about ruining everyone else’s Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanza if you talk about cancer. Somehow rushing around the mall for presents or cooking a major meal seems trivial and pointless in the larger sense of the life and death issues you are facing. You may not be ready to share your news with the extended family, yet at the same time, cancer is all you think about. New Year’s Day with its emphasis on making resolutions for the year ahead can bring on depression if you are worried that this may be your last year alive. Even if you don’t anticipate dying, it is hard to make positive resolutions when you know you will be spending much of the new year facing surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation treatments. For those already in treatment or recovering from surgery, there are even more challenges to face. You feel unwell. You ARE unwell. All the preparations for the holidays are too overwhelming to cope with. There is no way you will be baking, cooking, and cleaning, to prepare a feast for a crowd of people. Even preparing a simple Christmas meal with only your immediate family may be enough to knock you out for the next few days. If you are having chemotherapy, the smell of certain foods may make you feel nauseous. Chemotherapy often affects the taste buds making even favourite foods taste unpleasant. Painful mouth sores can make any kind of eating feel like torture. Fatigue and loss of appetite are also common side effects of chemotherapy. Finally, you may be warned by your oncologist to avoid crowds as your immune system is weakened. Shopping malls and large family gatherings may be more than just exhausting. They may make you so sick, you end up hospitalized. This happened to me 3 years ago and I spent the entire 4 day Thanksgiving holiday in the hospital with a fever and a white blood count of zero. Radiation treatment and surgery bring on their own challenges. As well as feeling exhausted, you may be in pain from radiation burns or in all the places where the surgeon cut into your body. You may be taking heavy duty painkillers that wreak havoc with your mind, appetite, and digestive system. You may not have the energy to sit up for long periods of time socializing and making small talk with people you are not especially close with the rest of the year. Even when active treatment has come to an end, the depression and anxiety associated with losing your medical safety net can leave you feeling less than merry or jolly. The holidays are difficult for most depression sufferers as the rest of the world looks so happy while you feel hopeless and miserable inside. Your fears of a recurrence or metastasis may be heightened right after treatment has ended and the oncologist says, “see you in 3 months”. It’s a scary time as you try to transition from full-time cancer patient to finding your “new normal”. People may be expecting you to bounce right back to your old life once treatment ends. You may feel like you still have one foot in the cancer world and the other foot in mid-air, looking for a safe landing spot in the post-treatment land. BRCA1 and BRCA2 families have their own special problems with family celebrations. They may be grieving the loss of those relatives who were taken from the world too soon because of cancer. Those who are previvors may worry about their own upcoming surgeries or question their decision to opt for surveillance. Watching the young children and teenagers of their extended families, they may worry as to what lays ahead for them in the future. For some people, the holidays may still be fun and joyous as it is a welcome distraction from thinking about cancer. You may welcome the break from the trudgery of treatment. Depending on the type of gathering, you may only be surrounded by the people you love most in the world and find their company soothing and comforting. Particularly if you have children, you may make an all out effort to give them great Christmas (or birthday) memories just in case things go terribly wrong and you want them to remember you as something other than a sick Mom. With my 4 cancers, I have been in diagnosis, treatment, or recovery mode on every major holiday and special event over the years. During Cancer 4, there was Thanksgiving in the hospital, my then 11 year old son’s birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese, and my then 9 year old daughter’s birthday party at a go cart track on a very windy day, while clutching onto my wig for dear life! It wasn’t always easy and it wasn’t always fun, but I’m glad we made some good memories on those occasions. Christmas and my birthday also fell during chemotherapy but both of those events were very low key affairs as that was all I was capable of doing at the time. The truth is nobody actually lives in a Disney movie, not the healthy and not the sick. Christmas or Thanksgiving or your birthday can be whatever you want it to be and whatever you are capable of doing. If you want company and all the trappings of Christmas, see if someone else can do the heavy lifting for you. Instead of you making the dinner, see if someone else can host Christmas this year. Or choose to celebrate more casually with your immediate family at home or at a Christmas buffet in some fancy restaurant where you won’t be forced to make small talk with a relative you barely know. To cut down on holiday stress, avoid the shopping malls and make all your purchases online. Spring the extra few dollars for them to be gift wrapped. Let your children decorate the tree however they want, no matter how untraditional the results may be. Do everything you can to pamper yourself, whatever that may look like to you. Get a lot of rest, take deep breaths, and don’t be afraid to reach out to someone, anyone, for help. Create a holiday that brings you peace instead of stress, joy instead of anxiety, even if it means abandoning all your former ideas of what a traditional holiday should be. Happy Holidays to everyone in Cancerland and to all the people who love them! Sharon Greene December 11, 2014 Sh Tweet Like this: Like Loading...",0,1,0.11179949059143697
894,48,19,4,12,2014,2014-12-04,"I heard the whispers, words I wasn’t meant to hear. “Did you know her cancer came back?” whispered a colleague I had known for 20 years. “Is she going to die?” was the new colleague’s response. The first colleague replied, “Not likely. She just gets cancer whenever she wants time off work. She never dies.” The words cut me to the bone, leaving me hurting yet strangely numb at the same time. There really was no need to whisper about my diagnosis at work. I never hid the fact that I had breast cancer in the past. I was surprised the gossip mill had started so soon as very few people knew I had been diagnosed with breast cancer for the fourth time. I had only just received the news myself and had told those in management I would be taking extended sick leave once again once I had a surgery date. The comments confused me. I get cancer whenever I want time off work? Surely there are easier ways to take time off then having another mastectomy and more chemotherapy. I never die when I am diagnosed with cancer? Well that has been true so far but at that point I had not had any scans or tests to see if the cancer had spread. At that point, all I knew was the cancer was back after a 16 year reprieve since cancer number 3. “She never dies” rang in my head the rest of the day. Do they really want me to die to prove I actually was sick? Do they not understand the physical and emotional toll breast cancer and its recurrences take on an individual? Would having a funeral make everything better for people so they could recast me as a heroic figure battling cancer to the bitter end instead of just a physically and emotionally battered woman trudging through treatment over and over again? The one thing I have learned about recurrences is that their negative effects are cumulative over time. Each recurrence is emotionally harder than the one before. Each time your recurrence is contained before it spreads throughout your body makes you feel you are living on borrowed time and that your luck will run out eventually. The message that is repeated over and over is that once you reach the 5 year cancer free mark, you are “cured” of cancer. This may be true for many people but it is not universally true for everyone. Many people have local recurrences of cancer in the same breast where they had it the first time. They may develop new primary breast cancer in the other breast or more rarely like me, develop a new primary cancer in the same breast. The pathologists decide if it is a recurrence or a new primary cancer based on how closely the second tumour resembles the first. If the second one is markedly different than the first, or if it occurs in the other breast, it is considered a new primary breast cancer. If it is a recurrence, it is thought that surgery/radiation/chemotherapy left some cancer cells behind that grew and multiplied to form a new tumour. As long as the recurrence or new primary is confined to the breast, it cannot kill you. It is only when it spreads beyond the breast(s) or mestastisizes to another body part, that it becomes lethal. Once that happens, there is no longer any talk of curing the cancer, only treating it until the treatments stop working. Recurrences/new primaries produce interesting responses in people. With my first breast cancer at 29, my divorced parents who hadn’t talked to each other in 8 years, rallied together and stayed with me for weeks during surgery and radiation. When my second cancer in the same breast was diagnosed at my 5 year “cure” mammogram, my mother had died 6 months earlier and my father made many excuses why he could not make the trip a second time. This was the first cancer that happened while at work and most of my colleagues rallied around this scared 34 year old facing a mastectomy and chemotherapy. They treated me as though this was my first breast cancer. I know that the night of my mastectomy, numerous work colleagues were gathered around my hospital bed. I was groggy and in pain but was aware enough to know that they were there and they cared. In the weeks that followed, many workmates dropped off food and accompanied me to my chemotherapy appointments. I felt supported, cared for, and loved. I felt a litle less love from the local breast cancer community. The first time around, doctors and social workers went out of their way to hook me up with other breast cancer survivors. Granted most of these women were 40 – 50 years older than me who had lived long and full lives, but I appreciated the effort. With the first cancer, I had a very proactive medical social worker who hooked me up with relaxation groups, guided meditation groups, and the only support group they had at the time for patients battling all kinds of cancer. By the time of my second cancer, I was pretty much left on my own. No volunteers, no social worker, and I had to beg to see a real live person who had reconstruction surgery. One finally showed up the night before my mastectomy but had a completely different surgery than I was having. I had the same breast cancer surgeon as I had for the first cancer. I couldn’t help but feel he was less interested in answering my questions this time around. I guess I was one of his failures for not quite making it to the 5 year cure mark. He just kept drumming into my head that I would have to wait an additional 5 years to get pregnant or my baby could very well be left without a Mommy. Sometimes during that experience, I felt like the medical professionals viewed me as just another Dead Woman Walking. The cancer struck my other breast 2 years later. I had barely returned to work and then was off again for surgery and radiation. By now, I was quick to pick up the signals that something was wrong with my mammogram. The technician would call me back into the room for a few more mammograms. Then she would disappear, returning with one or more people, who would whisper among themselves. At one point, I swear a whole group of student trainees crowded into the mammogram room, looking intently at the pictures. I would say “what are you seeing?” and the original technician would tell me there was nothing to worry about, this was just routine. I’d had enough mammograms by then to know this was anything but routine. When I got the official news from a doctor a couple of days later, it wasn’t exactly an overwhelming surprise. My Dad was too busy to come visit once ago. I had a new boyfriend who I would eventually marry (and divorce) who took good care of me. We even bought a puppy to aid in the healing process. Again, this was his first time dealing with my breast cancer so he was supportive. By this time, my colleagues were suffering battle fatigue dealing with my illnesses. There were a few meals, a lot less visitors, and more people who felt I should bounce right back. This was my third new primary breast cancer in 7 years and I was feeling beaten down and not terribly bouncy. Cancer surgery in the late 80s and the mid 90s involved removing all the lymph nodes under the arm on the side of the cancerous breast. This procedure is not the routine anymore but at that time it was and it made even a lumpectomy a gruelling operation with an extended recovery period. Also, each time there is a recurrence/new primary, there are a battery of scans of the liver, brain, lungs, and bones and numerous blood tests to see if the cancer has spread. Each new test is nerve wracking as you never know what may turn up. I have been very lucky so far that the cancers have been caught before they spread beyond the breast. I noticed when I started radiation treatments after Cancer 3, the other women would be friendly while we waited our turns. If however I said this was my second time doing radiation or that this was breast cancer number 3 at age 36, the women would clutch their floral housecoats tighter around themselves and would instinctively move a little farther away from me, as if my repeated cancers were contagious. I lucked out for the next 16 years. No cancer. I went for a routine mammogram and was called back for more pictures. The technologist told me to wait in the mammogram room while she went to check something. When she said more pictures were needed, I demanded to speak to the radiologist as I knew something was wrong. To my surprise, the radiologist did enter the mammography room. He stared at his shoes the whole conversation. He obviously didn’t talk to patients very often. He said there were calcifications on the mammograms that were highly suspicious for a malignancy. He had reviewed my prior mammograms and what he was seeing was new. I pushed him harder on what “highly suspicious” meant until he said he was almost 100% certain it was cancer again, but only a biopsy could provide the absolute truth. I was immediately sent for an ultrasound where no tumour could be found. Even after referring to the mammogram, no lump or bump could be felt. The surgeon thought this meant it was a tiny cancer caught extremely early. She was in no rush to schedule a biopsy or a surgical date. Things started going off the rails at the biopsy. Even with the mammogram, they weren’t sure they were hitting the right spot so the needle went in over and over again. When it was confirmed to be triple negative cancer again, the scans started. My sternum lit up on the bone scan. It had been broken 4 years earlier and they couldn’t be sure if they were seeing the break or cancer. The CT scan showed a web of tiny blood clot embolisms at the bottom of my lungs. As I had a spontaneous pulmonary embolism in one lung five years before, they immediately started me on blood thinners and debated delaying the surgery. The surgery went ahead as planned and to everyone’s surprise, it was 2.7 cm in size, making it a Stage 2 cancer. The reason it couldn’t be felt was that it was deep inside, close to my chest wall. The pathologists are evenly divided as to whether this was a new primary or a recurrence that had been hiding in my body for 16 years. By this time, my father was in a nursing home and I didn’t even tell him about the new cancer. I was a single Mom with 2 children, then aged 9 and 11. Some of my work colleagues did get together and raise money for flowers and groceries. 2 of them would visit me at least once per month while the rest kept their distance. One friend brought over her husband and brother-in-law and they and my kids did a good job housecleaning. I had a medical social worker again and she helped with getting me free rides to chemo and getting me into 2 healing touch sessions. This month marks 3 years since I finished my last chemo. After numerous CT scans, the radiologists have concluded that the bright light on my sternum during bone scans comes from trauma not cancer. The blood clots on my lungs disappeared after 6 monthes of daily injections in my stomach with blood thinners. Having multiple recurrences has taken a huge emotional toll on me. I no longer have faith in my body. It has betrayed me too many times. I no longer believe in an orderly universe where good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people. The universe seems pretty random to me. Cancer survival seems especially random to me. Every day on Facebook, I read about another woman with breast cancer who has died. Very often they are young and leave small children and a grieving partner behind. These were women who ate organic foods, ran marathons, and looked after their bodies. They did everything right and yet were struck down in the prime of their lives. Although I have had a double mastectomy, there is no guarantee I won’t get another recurrence/new primary breast cancer again. No matter how close they cut, it is impossible to remove every single breast cancer cell during surgery. I could probably summon the emotional strength to battle a recurrence/new primary for the fifth time, if only for the sake of watching my children grow up. But what worries me is that I have been playing Russian Roulette with breast cancer for 26 years now. I have been wounded but am still sitting at the table, waiting for my turn to press the gun to my head. How many times can you stare death in the eye and walk away still alive? One of these times, a new recurrence/new primary won’t be caught and treated in time. Or like 30% of women initially diagnosed with Stage 1-3 breast cancer, there will be no recurrence, just the dreaded metastasis to brain, bone, lungs, or liver from cancer cells still lurking in my body even after the last surgery and chemotherapy. I read in so many forums how women are terrified of having a recurrence. Please remember if it is local to the breast, it can be treated and life will go on. It is metastasis that you need to worry about as for that there is no cure. Have you had a recurrence/new primary since your initial treatment? Did you have early stage cancer that you thought was cured but it metastisized elsewhere? Please share your experiences in the comments below.

895,48,2,26,2,2015,2015-02-26,"It has taken some time, but now science and medicine acknowledge that chemo brain is a real side effect of chemotherapy. It can last for a few months or can linger on for years. Chemo brain is characterized by mental confusion, inability to multi-task, memory problems, the inability to concentrate, and vocabulary problems – either the inability to think of a common word or the inability to say the word aloud and say a different word or words instead. Chemo brain can be funny at times (particularly to one’s relatives and children) but mostly it is a frustrating and sometimes frightening state of affairs. I have had chemotherapy twice and have gone through this experience both times. Even 3 years past the second chemo, it still strikes me when I am overly tired or stressed. I composed a list of chemo brain incidents I personally experienced. If you can relate to these, you have probably experienced chemo brain too! 1. You lose your purse, cell phone and keys on a regular basis. You’ve been known to “misplace” your children from time to time but they always come back. 2. You lose your ability to think of everyday words. To compensate, you speak in awkward descriptive sentences like, “can you pass me a…a…little round dead cow?” at the neighborhood barbecue when you want a hamburger. 3. Your brain finally comes up with right word but your mouth has a mind of its own with random semi-related words coming out at unexpected times. Now that you have your burger, your brain thinks bun but your mouth asks for toast to put on your hamburger. 4. You get used to your children thinking you are being funny while your friends, neighbors, and fellow co-workers think you are drunk, crazy, or suffering early stage dementia whenever you open your mouth to speak. 5. It’s a good day at work when the only thing mismatched is your socks. Although your employer complains, at least they don’t know about the time you drove halfway to work in your pajamas before realizing you weren’t appropriately dressed. 6. You drive home from work and realize you have no memory of the ride home. 7. You find yourself at the grocery store or mall with no idea why you are there or what you came to buy. . 8. You can listen to the same old gossip time and again as you have no memory of hearing the story the first time round. 9. You are cooking and the phone rings. You forget about making dinner until the smoke detector reminds you. 10. You decide to tackle chemo brain head-on by making to- do lists and putting them in safe places. You immediately forget where those safe places are. These are my personal top ten hits of chemo brain. I’m sure there are many more, but frankly I have forgotten them. Please let me know I’m not alone in my daze and confusion. I’d love to hear the funny and not so funny things chemo brain did to you in the comments below.

897,48,21,17,11,2014,2014-11-17,"My mother, Lily Koval Brown, died exactly 22 years ago today of metastatic cancer. Her sister Joyce Koval Lamb died of metastatic cancer July 4, 1984. Their stories are completely different as mine is from theirs, but the one thing we all had in common was a mutation in our BRCA1 gene. Of course at the time of their deaths, the BRCA genes had not been discovered so it seemed like a sad coincidence that both died of cancer and that I, my parent’s only child, had breast cancer at 29. One of my earliest memories of discussing breast cancer with my mother was watching an old 60’s movie on tv called “Valley of the Dolls”. In that movie, one of the characters played by the actress Sharon Tate (later to be infamously murdered by Charles Manson) learned she had breast cancer. Her solution to dealing with this disease? Suicide. I remember my mother commenting that there was no way anyone would ever remove her breast. This was in the mid-70’s when breast cancer was firmly in the closet. It was also easy for my mother to make this comment as cancer didn’t seem to run in our family. With only her parents in Canada and the rest of the extended family still in Russia, we had no real idea if cancer did or didn’t run in our family. I am not sure when my aunt first noticed the lump in her breast. It had to have been before 1979 as that year, at the age of 19, I moved to the city where she lived, not knowing a soul. My mother asked if I could stay with her for a short time or if she could at least help me find a place of my own. I gather the answer to both requests was a panicked no but she would be happy to talk to me by phone whenever I wanted. Two years later, my parents split up and my mother moved to the same city where my aunt and I lived. She could never get my aunt to meet her in person although they did have long friendly telephone conversations. We didn’t suspect anything sinister about my aunt’s refusal to meeting us in person. We speculated she had grown eccentric and reclusive over the years although she was only 50. Things came to a head when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1980. She never did have to make the decision about choosing her breast or choosing her life. The doctors recommended a lumpectomy, a new operation that spared the majority of her breast. This procedure was so new that radiation was not part of the treatment program. While my aunt sent a bouquet of flowers, she still wouldn’t make the effort to visit in person which hurt my mom deeply. The telephone conversations became fewer and shorter until they ceased completely. The next news we had of my aunt came from her husband 2 years later. She was in the hospital as she had stopped breathing. My mother rushed to the hospital without any forewarning of what to expect. She found a skeletal woman in a hospital bed who appeared to be about 10 months pregnant. My mother pieced the story together as best she could. It started with a breast lump that my aunt refused to get checked out by a doctor. Somehow over time, the cancer became physically apparent which was when she became a recluse. She had no medical diagnosis or treatment whatsoever until the time of her hospitalization. I still don’t know exactly what her cancer status was. It’s safe to assume she started with breast cancer but whether the huge abdomen was from metastatic breast cancer that had spread or if she developed another primary cancer or 2 along the way, no one knows for sure. The medical staff wanted to start chemotherapy but she refused as she didn’t want to lose her long hair. It wouldn’t have made much of a difference at that stage as her cancer was too advanced. She died a few days later in the hospital, long hair still intact. My mother was flourishing in her new single life. She was always very upbeat and made friends quickly wherever she went. She reached the 5 year “cure” rate for breast cancer and we talked about how she made a much better decision about her cancer than her sister did. There was no thought of the cancer striking another part of her body, despite my aunt’s swollen abdomen, as we assumed this was just what untreated breast cancer looked like. Fast forward a year and I got a call from my Mom that she would be having surgery for suspected ovarian cancer. They found her cancer had metastisized throughout her whole reproductive system and there was a further inoperable tumour behind her heart. She spent a year in a very aggressive chemotherapy program that resulted in long term side effects such as loss of hearing in one ear. She was determined to beat cancer and had the support of her many friends and work colleagues. Her hospital rooms always seemed like party central with people packed into the small room. If a positive attitude and social support could cure cancer, my Mom would still be alive today. I had my first breast cancer two years later at 29. She flew to the city where I was now living and stayed with me through my lumpectomy and 6 weeks of radiation. The only time she was less than supportive of me was when she learned I had signed up for a clinical trial that would compare patients given one round of chemotherapy before surgery to those that had surgery alone. She did not want me taking chemotherapy under any circumstances. As it turned out, I was in the surgery alone group, so much to her relief I escaped chemotherapy that time around. My Mother made it to 4 years past surgery for ovarian cancer only to learn she had developed a third primary cancer in her colon. The cancer was surgically removed and she had a temporary colostomy bag that she would have to wear for a year. Coming home from the hospital, she broke down crying tears of frustration and anger. It was one of the few times she ever showed me what an emotional and physical toll all these cancers had on her mind, body, and spirit. A year passed and she had the reversal surgery for her colon cancer so she no longer needed to use the colostomy bag. She had now passed the 5 year mark for metastic ovarian cancer and the 10 year mark for breast cancer. She had about 10 more good months of life. The best thing I did was spontaneously make the 12 hour drive to visit her in the summer of 1992. Everything seemed to be going great and we planned a side trip to a national park in Montana. On the day we were to leave, my mother sheepishly asked if I would mind cancelling our trip as she wasn’t feeling well. She strongly encouraged me to drive back home even though I had planned on staying a few days longer. Reluctantly, I returned home. Within a week she called to tell me she would be having colon surgery again as another mass had been found. I talked to her surgeon after the operation who confirmed that it was colon cancer again but a completely different type than she had the first time. He also said they found metastic disease throughout her liver and there was nothing left to do that would prolong her quality of life. I asked how much time she had left to live and he paused, looked at me, and said maybe 6 – 9 months. He was either being overly optimistic or he found it easier to lie to me to give me hope. He said my mother was a remarkable woman having fought so valiantly against 4 unrelated cancers, hitting the 5 year “cure” rate on 2 of them. Maybe he wasn’t lying about the time she had left. Maybe he thought she would beat the odds one more time despite the grimness of the prognosis. In any event, I made plans with my mother for a trip we would take as soon as she got better. She gave me a sad smile but nodded along with all my dreams and plans. About 6 weeks later, I received a phone message at work telling me to come quickly as my Mom only had 2 days left to live. I basically lived in the hospital room with her for the next 17 days until her body finally gave out. Her appearance was shocking as she had lost so much weight in the top half of her body that she barely resembled the woman I had seen 6 weeks prior. Her legs had become enormous from fluid build-up from her cancerous liver. I believe the cancer had spread to her brain as she became increasingly paranoid and suspicious of her food being poisoned and medical staff planning to kill her. She would have lucid moments – she planned her own funeral from her hospital bed – but near the end, she had seemingly lost all her words, communicating only in guttural sounds. The last semi-lucid conversation I had with her was that she had something important to tell me but she couldn’t do it in the hospital. She wanted me to meet her downtown. As that was impossible, I never learned what her important message to me was all about. I still wish I knew. Although I spent 17 days bedside in the hospital, my mother clung onto life. Finally, I asked the nurses if I could leave for an hour to shower and bring new clothes. Of course, it was in that hour abscence that she finally let go of life and passed away. I saw her before anyone had time to pretty her up and she had the most incredible expression on her face. I can only describe it as a look of awe, as if she was seeing something perfect and wonderful. My mother’s final gift to me was to remove the fear of death. I have a lot of fear of the dying process but never again would I fear actual death. It took until 2011, after an initial false negative on the first BRCA test I took, to learn that I was BRCA positive. By extension, so were my mother and my aunt. Unlike my aunt, I found my first breast lump myself and was checked out and treated immediately. Like my mother, I have had 4 primary cancers but mine have so far all been confined to the breast. My mother’s first breast cancer was at 50 while mine was at 29. She had 4 primary cancers in a 12 year period while I had 4 primary cancers in a 22 year period. 3 of my primary cancers occurred over a 7 year period. My family was small to begin with and the BRCA1 gene cut a devastating path of destruction across my family tree. I have felt like an orphan since my mother died when I was 32. She has missed so much in the last 22 years. I have been roughed up by life quite a bit which has humbled me. I am no longer the spoiled brat only child I still was when she left me. She missed my marriage (and divorce), the adoption of my 2 wonderful children that she would have spoiled and adored, and any number of wonderful and terrible things that have happened through the years. I wonder what she would think of my double mastectomy, my 2 courses of chemotherapy, and the fact I had my ovaries removed as a preventive measure. Given her fighting spirit, I think she would have approved, despite her fears of mastectomy and chemotherapy. There were so many times I thought that I have heard her voice in a crowd or smelled a perfume that made me think of her. It took a few years before I stopped automatically dialing her number on the phone to tell her some big news. Even 22 years later, I still miss my Mom so much it’s like a physical ache in my heart. I hope someday we will make that trip downtown together so she can finally tell me the important thing she wanted me to know.

899,48,23,5,11,2014,2014-11-05,"Ok, I’ll admit that the title of this article is slightly misleading. But only slightly. I now have a double mastectomy but it took 22 years from first diagnosis and 4 bouts of breast cancer to get there. I never did choose a double mastectomy. It just kind of happened when I had exhausted all other treatment options. When people hear that I am a 4 time survivor, they shake their heads and wonder why I didn’t have a double mastectomy when I was first diagnosed with cancer. The reasons for the decisions I made were partly historical, partly personal choice, and partly based on the medical advice I received at the time. Historical and Medical Reasons My first diagnosis of breast cancer was in 1988. This was at a time where women’s health advocates had been fighting for years to provide women with breast conserving options after many decades of the standard treatment being the Halstead radical mastectomy. This operation bears little resemblance to today’s mastectomies as all the chest muscles and structure were removed along with the breast, leaving a large hollow on that side of the chest. By all accounts, this was a horribly disfiguring surgery that almost guaranteed the patient life long problems with the arm on the side where the breast had been removed. The 1980’s brought in a new surgery – the lumpectomy – which removed the tumour and a wide area around it which allowed women to keep part or most of their breast, depending on the size of the tumour and the size of the breast. The removal of a big tumour in a small breast would be much more disfiguring than the removal of a small tumour in a big breast. Lumpectomy combined with 6 weeks of radiation treatment was found to have comparable results for mortality and reoccurrence as a full mastectomy (removal of breast with chest muscles left intact). These same statistics hold true today, except for women like me who have a genetically based cancer. The prevailing mood of the times was that the lumpectomy and radiation regime was a huge step forward for women taking back control of their bodies from the male dominated medical profession. The knowledge base in the 1980’s was much more limited than it is today. Today we recognize at least 5 major types of cancer: lobular, inflammatory, hormone positive, herceptin positive, and triple negative, the type that I have. In 1988, herceptin had not been discovered and without knowledge of its existence, there was no category for triple negative cancer as the triple means the cancer is not fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone nor by herceptin. It is now often said that triple negative cancer is the most aggressive cancer but in 1988, all that could be said was that my cancer was not caused by hormones. We now know that the prescence of triple negative cancer in a young person often leads to the conclusion that the cancer is hereditary in nature. I was diagnosed at 29. The average age for breast cancer patients is 55-60. There was no genetic testing for breast cancer as there is today. There was the knowledge that having a family history of the disease was a risk factor but there was as yet no proof that some cancers were due to a genetic mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. A family history was just one of many risk factors that could make a person more likely to get breast cancer, no more or less significant than failing to have a pregnancy before 20, failing to have breast fed a baby, or having an early start to menstruation. I had all of these factors working against me so while the doctors noted my young age as being unusual for this disease, the combination of all my risk factors provided some explanation. My young age in itself did not set off any warning bells as it would today. I was given the option of either a single mastectomy or a lumpectomy with radiation. No one would have even considered suggesting a double mastectomy as the other breast was seemingly healthy. Why cut off a perfectly healthy body part in a 29 year old woman? It was pretty much assumed by the doctors that I would go the lumpectomy route as I was a young unmarried woman with no significant other and no children. I did agree to meet with a plastic surgeon to see how they could reconstruct my breast if I chose a single mastectomy. Let’s just say reconstruction surgery has progressed tremendously in the last 25 years. Looking through the book of photos that the plastic surgeon proudly showed me, I was appalled and horrified at the results. Thanks but no thanks! I”ll have the lumpectomy if you don’t mind. Doctors, family, and friends all assured me I’d made the right decision. I stayed healthy and was cancer free until I went in for my 5 year check-up. I always thought that if you made it to 5 years, your cancer was cured. Unfortunately, another lump was found in the same breast. Lumpectomy was no longer an option as you can only have radiation treatment on the same breast once. My only option this time was a mastectomy and 9 months of chemotherapy. I was 34 when I had a mastectomy on my left breast. The pathology report again said I had hormone negative cancer but it was much more aggressive than the first tumour had been. The pathogists concluded that this wasn’t a recurrence of the first cancer but was a brand new primary cancer. I was told that even if I’d had a mastectomy at 29, I still would have gotten cancer again 5 years later. Again, no one suggested a double mastectomy as triple negative cancer still hadn’t been discovered and genetic testing wasn’t available. Two years later at 36, a mammogram of my right breast showed a tiny cancer that was too small to be felt. Having breast cancer 3 times in 7 years at my age was highly unusual but my family doctor was the only one to push me towards a second mastectomy. Genetic testing was now just becoming available so I agreed to having a lumpectomy immediately and would have a second operation for a mastectomy if I was found to have a genetic cancer. The type of genetic testing that was available at the time only looked for the wrong “lettering” in the parts of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes that had been decoded to date. In other words, if the code was supposed to be ” “abcd” and your code read “abcf”, the test would catch it and would compare your code with others with the same lettering to see if it had been linked with breast cancer. They did find one wrong letter in my coding but it was of “unknown significance” (and still is 18 years later) as there weren’t enough people with this particular variation to determine if it was associated with breast cancer or not. I was basically told that unless I heard otherwise, to assume I did not have a hereditary cancer. The doctors called it a new primary cancer as it was in the other breast but assured me that as it was caught so early, the likelihood of recurrence or metastisis was miniscule. (We now know that early detection doesn’t always work that way and many people do have recurrences and metastasis even when caught at such an early stage). So the breast stayed after a lumpectomy and another 6 week stint of radiation. I was cancer free for the next 16 years, only going for yearly mammograms. I felt pretty damn safe after all that time. Cancer was a thing of the past, something I had seemingly outgrown. But in 2011, the mammogram picked up some calcifications in my right breast that were highly suspicious for cancer. I had my second mastectomy in 2011 followed by a different type of chemotherapy than I had when I was 34. It was at this time that I learned I was having my fourth battle with triple negative cancer. The pathologists had retested the old tumours to come up with this finding. They saw that each cancer was progressively more aggressive than the one before. The pathologists are divided as to whether this was my fourth new primary cancer or if this was a recurrence with the previous cancer cells hiding and evolving in my body for 16 years. I was urged to be genetically retested as the tests could now also look for things other than rearrangement of the coding letters. The retest showed that I was missing a large portion of genetic material at the end of my BRCA1 gene. The genetic counsellor described it as being like a book with the last 4 chapters ripped out. It took 22 years to learn I had genetic triple negative breast cancer. The deletion in my BRCA1 gene also put me at a high risk of getting ovarian cancer so after chemotherapy was over, I had my ovaries and tubes removed as a preventive measure. Just as having a mastectomy does not guarantee you won’t get breast cancer again either in the scar tissue or metastisized to some other organ, ovary removal does not mean you can’t get cancer where your ovaries used to be. But I’m keeping my fingers crossed that 4 bouts of cancer are enough for one person! Personal Reasons My first three cancers occurred in my 20’s and 30’s. While there were support groups available, I never met anyone who was even remotely close to me in age. I thought I was the only one my age going through this. I was single, trying to re-enter the dating market, and couldn’t imagine doing so without a breast. (After all, who wants to date the only 29 year old woman in the world without a breast?) The reconstruction pictures I saw at 29 were frightening and the actual reconstruction I got at 34 was even worse. I was not anxious to do the whole thing over again at 36 when it was such a tiny cancer that had been caught early. And by 36, I had done my due diligence, gone for genetic testing, and had been cleared for hereditary cancer. Coupled with that, my mother had a lumpectomy without radiation in 1980 and her breast cancer never came back. By the time of my first cancer diagnosis, she had not only survived breast cancer, but she had also battled ovarian cancer 3 years earlier. By the time of my second cancer, she was dead from her second bout of colon cancer but her breast cancer never came back. Call me vain and shallow for wanting to keep my breasts as long as I could. That’s okay. It was a different world then. Breast cancer was still stigmatized, I was insecure, I was scared, and I had no idea my genetic make-up predisposed me to having cancer after cancer. My present oncologist believes I still would have had multiple breast cancers even if I had double mastectomies back in 1988 as like my mother, I get new primaries not recurrences. I try to imagine what I would have done had medical science been more advanced, had complete genetic testing been available, and had I been living in a world of online support groups for young women. A world like today where breast cancer is fully mainstream and there is a whole month of the year dedicated to raising awareness of the disease. Would I have done things differently? Maybe, but I don’t know for sure. Even if all my choices were wrong, breast cancer is such a crap shoot that I find myself still alive and kicking 25 years later while so many others who did everything right are dead. Breast cancer isn’t just or fair. I carry my fair share of survivor’s guilt but that is a topic for a whole other post.

902,48,3,19,2,2015,2015-02-19,"I saw a meme the other day that said something like “cancer can take away my body parts but it can’t touch my mind, my heart, or my soul.” Lovely words, heroic even, if you don’t think about them too closely. I thought about them very closely and found I disagreed strongly with the message. One way to interpret this meme is the superficial positive message of, “I am more than my disease. I am still a real person under the scars and the bald head and the chemo sickness. I am still me in my mind, heart, and soul”. On that level, I can accept the meme’s message. But when I look at the words as they are written, not searching for a positive hidden meaning, I find myself in total disagreement with them. I don’t think we can compartmentalize our lives that easily. The physical changes impact the mind, the emotions, and the spirit. It is not just the physical changes that lead to mental and emotional distress. The very process of being diagnosed with a life-threatening disease plays havoc with our minds, emotions, and our spirits. We are more than the sum of our physical parts. Our bodies, minds, emotions, and spirits are all intertwined to make up the whole package of our being. Our bodies don’t exist in some separate dimension away from the mental and emotional parts of our being. I do not believe that we come out of the other side of a cancer experience the same person we were when we went in. Dealing first with the physical changes that cancer brings upon us, they have an enormous impact on the mind, the heart (emotions), and the soul (the very core of our being and our belief system). Breast cancer treatment often strips us of our breast(s), our hair, our fertility, and sometimes our ovaries or even our whole reproductive system. Often times treatment pushes a woman into at least temporary menopause. For others, the menopause is early and is permanent. No matter what kind of treatment is involved, there is physical pain and sickness from surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Our whole body image can change dramatically in only a few months time. Suddenly, all the physical attributes of what makes us female are gone. This plays havoc on our self-esteem and self-confidence. Yes breasts can be reconstructed, hair will grow back, fertility may be regained if we are very young and lucky or if we had the foresight to freeze eggs or embryos in advance of chemotherapy or gynecological surgery. But breast reconstruction often involves multiple surgeries and for some, the end result is disappointing at best. And a reconstructed breast no longer has any feeling in it, no matter how cosmetically wonderful it may look. Assisted reproduction techniques are not always successful. Chemotherapy can leave behind a permanent legacy of neuropathy (numbness in the hands and feet), hormonal drugs can lead to chronic joint pains, and surgical or chemically induced menopause symptoms can be more severe than natural menopause and are unlikely to be treated with hormonal supplements as these may reignite cancer. With all these physical “side-effects” of cancer treatment, is it any wonder that many women feel distressed or depressed or highly anxious? When you look in the mirror and don’t even recognize the person you were 6 months earlier, it is bound to affect you mentally and emotionally. If you are in chronic pain and are suffering hot flashes at 30, it tends to change your outlook on life. As far as cancer not being able to touch your mind, I have one word for that. Chemobrain. It is real, it affects your memory, your concentration, and your ability to communicate effectively. It can feel as though you have had a mini-stroke as you dig through the filing cabinets of your mind to find that elusive everyday word you have used a million times before. Other times the right word is in your brain but a totally random word comes out of your mouth as if your brain and mouth were no longer connected. Then there is the disconcerting habit of losing things – your purse, your keys, your phone – only to find them right in front of you the whole time. So yes, cancer treatment can take away the mind for many of us, at least temporarily. As far as the heart or the emotions, just the very diagnosis of having a disease that can potentially kill you tends to strike fear and panic into your heart. You wait endlessly for pathology reports and the results of various scans to see if the cancer has spread. You worry about loved ones and how they will cope during treatment, or in the worst case scenario death, particularly if they are young children or aged parents that you normally care for. Even when the cancer is caught at an early stage and the prognosis is good, most women are still highly anxious about a recurrence or a future diagnosis showing the cancer has spread. Once you have had cancer, you feel your body has betrayed you once and can do so again. Your sense of safety in the world has been irrevocably affected. You have come face to face with your own mortality, realizing you just might not live to a ripe old age. These factors can bring on depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and in some cases, PTSD. So yes, cancer can and usually does attack the heart (emotions) as well as the body. Finally, your soul or your very essence of being can be adversely affected as your perspective on life changes. Some of the changes may be for the good in that you start to appreciate the people and things around you more as you feel you came close to losing them. But it can also make you more wary of planning for the future, knowing that cancer could re-enter your life at any time. You suddenly become aware that many women are dying of this disease, women your age and younger, as well as women whose cancers were also detected early and were given an excellent prognosis. The world of cancer seems very random, more like a roll of the dice than like the orderly world of the cancer media which says early detection will keep you safe. You may search for ways to put yourself in control of your cancer by completely changing your diet and lifestyle only to hear about organic vegans who ran triathlons and died of cancer anyway. When you realize that the difference between living and dying of this disease seems to be more a matter of luck than anything else, your previously optimistic view of an orderly controlled world is essentially gone for good. Perhaps I am presenting an overly pessimistic view due to my personal history of having breast cancer 4 times. It is a rarity in the breast cancer world to have cancer strike 4 times and not spread beyond the breast. I am grateful that I have been spared from Stage 4 cancer multiple times, particularly as I also have a BRCA1 mutation to contend with. But even “good” recurrences like mine come with a huge emotional and spiritual price tag attached. I am constantly looking over my shoulder waiting for cancer to strike again. It is impossible for me to believe that this time I have “beaten” cancer as it keeps coming back for another round. Even if my breast cancer days are over, the BRCA1 mutation means I am susceptible to other forms of cancer that may be waiting in the wings to strike when I least expect it. I don’t blame cancer for all the problems in my life. But I would be lying if I said that cancer didn’t have a negative impact on all areas of my life. I don’t believe cancer only took physical body parts away from me. It took much more of a toll on my emotions and spirit that I tried my best to cover up for many years. I am still happy with my life but I miss the wide eyed optimist I used to be. I don’t think she is ever coming back again and that makes my mind, heart, and spirit sad.

Journeying Beyond Breast Cancer Sharon, Carter, and Kayla Greene I was first diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at age 29, way back in 1988. The protocol at that time was to tell women to wait 5 years before getting pregnant or, as my breast surgeon so crudely put it, “Baby might not have a Mama”. Nothing like the subtle approach to shut down any further questions on that subject! 5 years passed, and I went to my “cure” date mammogram confident that all was well. It wasn’t. The cancer had returned to the same breast and as I had radiation the first time, the only option left was a mastectomy and 9 months of chemotherapy. I again heard the “Baby and Mama” speech.

906,48,7,28,1,2015,2015-01-28,"Ask almost any cancer survivor about whether they have become a bit of a hypochondriac, and the answer is usually a resounding yes. I have a confession to make. I swing from extreme hypochondria to total denial of any symptoms I may have. When you have a disease that can travel to your lungs, bones, liver, and brain (and sometimes skin, pancreas, ovaries, and uterus, particularly if you have a BRCA mutation), that pretty much covers most of the human body. Most of us didn’t start off as hypochondriacs. It almost seems to be a standard side effect of the disease. It doesn’t help to be living in a time where medical symptoms and their potential causes are a mere Google search away. We are not stupid people. We know that we can get non-cancer related illnesses like the flu, arthritis, and broken bones due to trauma. But still the aches and pains of everyday living take on a new urgency when they could be the early signs of bone or liver or brain metastisies, particularly if we don’t recall doing anything that would have brought the pain on in the first place. Reading metastic disease questions and answers can really put a scare into you. Someone will invariably ask, “how did you know you had bone or brain or lung Mets?” and the answer is often a vague recollection of pain in a hip or frequent headaches or breathlessness. And it is so easy to think I have pain in my hip or bad headaches or trouble catching my breath when I climb up a flight of stairs. That realization combined with a short visit to Dr. Google can be enough to convince you for an hour or a night or a week that you too have metastatic cancer. It really doesn’t matter if the medical literature says that rarely do bone Mets strike below the knee or elbow. Google cancer of the hand or foot and you are bound to find a case study or 2 of some poor person who had this rare metastasis strike them. If they can get it, why not you? Much of this crazy making hypochondria strikes once treatment has ended and you aren’t due to see your oncologist for another 4 months. You don’t know if you are overreacting or if in fact you are experiencing early signs of metastisis. Many cancer agencies have a nurse on call who can help evaluate your symptoms over the phone. Your family doctor can also be a source of comfort in checking out more common reasons for your symptoms. As they taught us in law school, if you hear hoof beats outside your window, think horses, not zebras. Some of the rules of thumb I have learned from my medical sources is to wait a few days and see, for example, if the body aches were early signs of a cold or flu or muscle strain from an activity you may have forgotten. Keep a record of your pain – the type, duration, whether it is worse at night, and if over the counter medicines relieve it. If it is getting worse or is keeping you up at night, by all means get it checked out. It may still be non-cancer related but it needs to be checked out if only for your peace of mind. And sometimes it really is a herd of zebras rushing by your window so better to be safe than sorry. A lot of the hypochondria does disappear with time, once you have experienced symptoms that can be explained as coming from non-cancer sources. If you have had a cancer recurrence or new primary, the hypochondria will return with a vengeance. If your body can get cancer again after surgery, chemo, and/or radiation, why couldn’t that cancer have spread before the recurrence was detected? There are no easy answers. Sometimes a recurrence has already spread to distant body parts. These should be picked up by various scans or MRI’s. Other times, your bodily pains are mere coincidence or are actually brought on by the stress of a new cancer diagnosis. For example, pounding headaches, nausea, and an upset stomach can be an an emotional reaction to the stress of a recurrence being diagnosed and not a symptom that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body. I can give a few examples from my own life to illustrate how this has affected me. When I was first treated for cancer, every piece of scar tissue seemed like a new lump. There were a few trips back to the surgeon to be checked out, more mammograms, and even a biopsy just to be sure. After hearing the message scar tissue over and over again, I eventually calmed down and stopped looking for symptoms. Shortly before my 5 year “cure” check-up, I stepped funny off a curb and broke my ankle. I chalked it up to bad luck and went to my 5 year mammogram in a cast and on crutches. When they found a new breast tumor, I was suddenly convinced that cancer had spread to my ankle bone. No matter how many people looked at the x-ray of my ankle, I was convinced I had metastic cancer of the ankle. Finally a bone scan and ct scan ruled out any metastisis to the bone and eventually, I believed the doctors. Something similar happened after my last cancer when I tripped on the bottom step and somehow broke my foot. It had seemed like a nothing accident and again it took a whole team of doctors to convince me this was just a freak twisting accident and not evidence of bone cancer of the foot. Finally, I had a week of burning pains in my scalp followed by what looked like hives on one side of my face. It wasn’t scalp or skin cancer. It was shingles. Painful awful shingles on half of my scalp and face but nothing that was cancer related. Over the 27 years of fighting cancer, I have self-diagnosed myself with a brain tumor, lung Mets, hand cancer, and a few other medical oddities. Every time I am proved wrong, I become more reluctant to have my symptoms checked out for fear of being seen as the complete neurotic I truly can be. Some of us find it hard to draw the line between thinking the worst of every bodily pain and knowing when it is time to seriously check things out. My inner compass doesn’t function very well anymore after so many false alarms. I have swung to the other side of the pendulum, not getting things checked out in a timely manner. I ignored the raging cough that lasted for 6 weeks and left me exhausted only to find I had raging bronchitis that could have been treated weeks earlier. I am now so paranoid about being seen as a hypochondriac that I let things drag on for way too long, creating both mental and physical pain that could have been treated more promptly. Have you found a balance between hypochondria and getting attention for legitimate health complaints? If you have any suggestions as to how to strike the proper balance, I’d love to hear from you in the comments below. If this is something you still struggle with, I’d love to hear from you too.

907,48,8,23,1,2015,2015-01-23,"Some people skip my posts as they don’t want to know that breast cancer can strike more than once. They believe that my story must be a real downer as who wouldn’t be depressed to have their cancer come back again and again and again? Others look to find differences in their stories from mine to reassure themselves that this will not happen to them. I don’t know how many people have asked me if this whole mess couldn’t have been avoided if I just had a double mastectomy with my first breast cancer at 29? Hindsight is usually 20/20 but even my oncologists aren’t convinced that would have stopped the cancer from coming back. I had new primaries, not recurrences, and it is very possible they still would have grown in my mastectomy scars. I would like to assure you my story is not all doom and gloom and there are many positive conclusions that can be drawn from my story. I wrote at length as to why I made the treatment decisions I did in my blog post entitled. Why I Chose Not To Have A Double Mastectomy. Basically, it was a combination of historical reasons (double mastectomies were not offered as an option in 1988 when there was cancer in only one breast), lack of the medical knowledge we have now (there was no disease called triple negative breast cancer then as the third component -herceptin – had yet to be discovered) and genetic testing did not exist until Cancer 3 and the early tests were less comprehensive than they are now. I in fact had BRCA testing in the mid-90s and was told I was negative, a “fact” I believed for the next 16 years, although I later learned I had a major BRCA1 mutation. The other factor consisted of personal reasons for choosing the options I did. With no internet and no support groups for young women with breast cancer, I did not even know of young women with mastectomies, let alone double mastectomies. I was 29, then 34, and then 36 when my first 3 breast cancers struck. I was single, childless, and reconstruction surgery was not terribly advanced, and I adamantly didn’t want a mastectomy. I got one anyway at 34 when my cancer returned in the form of a new primary in the same breast that had a prior lumpectomy and radiation treatment. Mastectomy was the only option. Reconstruction was very bad and it turned me off from having a second mastectomy when cancer struck in the other breast 3 years later. In any event, it serves no purpose to speculate if things would have turned out differently had my treatment choices been different all those years ago. I made the best decisions I could at the time in consultation with my doctors based on the state of medical knowledge at the time and my personal preferences for treatment. To be a 4 time cancer survivor without Mets who has lived almost 27 years since the time of first diagnosis is like being a medical unicorn. There aren’t many like me around. My mother battled 4 different types of cancer in a 12 year period – breast, metastic ovarian, and 2 different types of colon cancer, the second one metastic. Other than that, I don’t know anyone else with a cancer history similar to my own. It can be a lonely feeling at times, not having any real life examples of others who have walked a similar journey. What happens next? Do I live to a ripe old age, dying for reasons unrelated to cancer? Is there going to be breast cancer 5 and if so, will this be the one that metastisizes? Will the earlier cancers metastasize and put me into Stage 4 cancer territory? The doctors have no answers for me. So a big part of having had 4 different breast cancers is the uncertainty on the part of myself and my doctors as to what happens next. Having cancer multiple times, plays havoc on your mind and emotions. Just when you think you are “cured” and cancer is a thing of the past, it rears its ugly head again, announcing, “I’m back…” Having one bout of cancer is incredibly stressful to your body, mind, and spirit. Having it 4 times is downright demoralizing, with the initial thought each time that I can’t go through this yet again. But really what choice do you have? If you want a shot at living, you”ll have the surgery and take the chemo and/or radiation recommended. Having watched an aunt die from completely untreated cancer, that is not a path I’m willing to take. Unfortunately for me, experiencing the trauma of cancer over and over again, led to depression, panic attacks, and ultimately PTSD. I am finally getting the professional help I need to tackle these issues. In a culture that says breast cancer patients have to be brimming with positivity all the time, this fake front I believe contributed to my PTSD condition. Never being able to acknowledge how you really feel about going through treatment one more time, can lead to a crazy-making life. Another thing that I have had to grapple with is survivor’s guilt. Why have I been able to stay Mets-free and survive 4 different aggressive triple negative breast cancers with a highly defective BRCA1 gene? Why do others get breast cancer once, have it metastasize, and die from the disease while mine functions more like a chronic disease that flares up every now and then? I have no answers to this question. No answers at all. The flip side of survivor’s guilt is that hopefully it takes away people’s fears, at least a little bit, when the newly diagnosed hear my story. So many women come into the online Facebook groups that deal with triple negative breast cancer, already convinced they have been handed a death sentence. Others worry that they have been diagnosed with a BRCA gene and that combined with triple negative breast cancer, dooms them to a short life and an early death. I try to point out that I have had high grade triple negative cancer 4 times and have a major BRCA1 mutation and am still alive and kicking almost 27 years later. I have not been a model cancer patient by any means but I am still alive. Neither triple negative cancer nor a BRCA mutation or both necessarily mean an immediate death sentence. I hope my story helps to reinforce this message and allows the patient reading it hope for a long future. The 4 bouts of cancer are a very rare occurrence and it is my wish that people stop fixating on the 4 times and focus on the 27 years of extended life.

I am reblogging it here so I can keep it forever. The video is very inspiring as well. Thank you Looking For The Light for writing this beautiful piece for me. There are people you meet in life who leave you in awe. The ability to push forward, awe to fight a disease trying to kill them not once but four times. Awe of their strength in the weakest moments to care for their children. Awe not give up, just throw in the towel, who would blame them.

910,50,2,12,3,2016,2016-03-12,"Today marks eight years since the day I found out I had breast cancer. I vividly remember the call I received from my doctor telling me I had the ""garden variety"" of breast cancer--carcinoma. That was the good news. It wasn't an aggressive disease like triple-negative breast cancer. The bad news is that the lump in my left breast was over five centimeters--the size of a golf ball--which indicated it had probably spread to my lymph nodes. That indeed proved to be true. After the biopsy and scan results came in, the breast surgeon announced my ultimate diagnosis; Stage 3 locally-advanced breast cancer. The implications of that diagnosis made me realize that if I had waited six months to get my annual physical, the cancer would have probably evolved into Stage 4 breast cancer in which case I most certainly would have been dead by now. Doing what I love at The Elephant's Trunk flea market I know what you're thinking. How could I not have felt such a large tumor? The fact is I had large, dense breasts. When my doctor showed me where the lump was, all I could feel was a subtle, ridge. buried deep into the underside of my breast. Honestly, I had no clue. That illustrates how insidious breast cancer can be. You feel perfectly fine, Then comes this suspicious lump. I will admit it, I never bothered checking for lumps regularly and I did miss getting a mammogram the previous year. Since the lump in my breast was so big, my course of treatment dictated that I undergo chemotherapy first in order to shrink the lump followed by surgery to remove it. To make matters worse, when I had undergone the MRI to discover how far the cancer spread, they found another pea-sized lump in my right breast. This meant that I had to undergo the most aggressive treatment possible. Here's how it went down: Twelve weeks of chemotherapy followed by surgery, which included a mastectomy in my left breast and a lumpectomy in my right breast. Eight weeks of radiation. Four months later, the road to breast reconstruction began. Because they were not able to get clean margins in my right breast, I had to undergo another mastectomy as well. Then there were complications with reconstruction during surgery on my left side due to radiation. I ended up having three subsequent surgeries, with my last ""tweaked"" procedure done July 2011--more than three years after my initial diagnosis. It was a long road. After that, life shifted into normal gear--with a difference. I embraced it more. Above all, I sought opportunities to have fun--to enjoy the privilege of being alive. That meant that my passions and interests no longer took a back seat. The things I loved to do during my spare time were explored immediately. For instance, I have always loved scouring through tag sales and flea markets and I always liked decorating my home, I kicked those hobbies into high gear. I spent more time refurbishing old furniture and updating my home. I am constantly re-painting, rearranging, and revamping everything in my environment. Then I started refinishing sorry, old furniture and flipping them for profit on Facebook tag sale sites. The point is, it really does matter that you take time to enjoy life doing the things that you love. After all, you were given a second chance. Don't waste it.",0,1,0.12848816029143895
911,50,3,29,2,2016,2016-02-29,"Blogger's note: I an pleased to accept Bryan Mac Murray's article which answers so many questions that women battling breast cancer ask me. Bryan, thank you for being a guest blogger. Disability benefits are only “automatically” available for breast cancer under certain circumstances. The cancer must be advanced, recurrent, or resistant to treatment. In all other cases, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will need to see additional proof in order to find you disabled by your cancer and/or cancer treatments. While cancer and cancer treatments are certainly disabling, they don’t automatically meet SSA disability requirements. This is because disability benefits are only available if you have an impairment that causes long-term or permanent disability or if you have a terminal illness. Medically Qualifying Under the Breast Cancer Listing The SSA maintains disability listings for conditions that automatically qualify for benefits. Breast Cancer is among these and appears in the SSA’s listing of conditions called the Blue Book under Section 13.01. To meet this listing, your cancer must be one of the following: Advanced, inflammatory carcinoma A metastatic carcinoma that has spread to lymph nodes A carcinoma that has returned after treatment Other types of breast cancer can also qualify under this listing by closely matching one of the situations listed above. Compassionate Allowance for Terminal Breast Cancer Highly aggressive forms of breast cancer and those that are advanced, recurrent, and no longer responsive to treatment fall under the SSA’s Compassionate Allowances (CAL) program. CAL-designation ensures your application is reviewed quickly and that the medical evidence required for approval is minimal. Qualifying Without Meeting the SSA’s Disability Listing If your breast cancer doesn’t qualify through the Blue Book, you may still be able to get approved for benefits. Just be prepared for your application to initially be denied and for your wait for benefits to be longer. You’ll need to request a second review of your claim and reevaluation of your medical evidence, but you should also be prepared for the possibility that you’ll be denied a second time. If denied again, you can appeal the decision and have your claim reviewed by an administrative law judge. You may wish to consider seeking assistance from a disability advocate or attorney from the start if you know you cannot meet the SSA’s disability listing for breast cancer. An advocate or attorney can help you build a strong case and can assist in arguing your claim at an appeal hearing, if one is necessary. Applying for Benefits Disability benefits are available through two programs SSI and SSDI. Each program requires a separate application process. SSDI applications can be submitted online or at the local office. For SSI however, you’ll need to interview with an SSA representative at the local branch. He or she will complete your SSI application for you. No matter which program you apply for, you’ll need: · details of your work history, education, job training, and previous job duties. · contact information for all your doctors and other healthcare providers. · financial information, including all sources of income and support as well as any assets you hold. Consider taking copies of the medical records you have with you to your local SSA office or submit those copies via mail just after completing your online SSDI application. Although the SSA will have you fill out consent forms that allow them to access your medical records, you wait for a decision can be shorter if you provide medical documentation directly to them at the time you apply for benefits.",0,1,0.10806755260243632
912,50,4,5,2,2016,2016-02-05,"I can't believe it. Next month, I will celebrate eight years as a breast survivor. It seems like another lifetime because everything has been normal now for a long time. In fact, it's been so long, I sometimes forget that I ever had cancer at all. Yet, as I skip along through life these days, there are things inside my inner psyche that have fundamentally changed. During my cancer fight, I had some huge aha moments that permanently changed my perspective and influence the choices I make today. I like to call this personal evolution my Breast Cancer Lessons. Since this is a breast cancer blog, not a journal, (which I habitually forget) I thought I would share these lessons with you. Lesson 1: I no longer care what other people think about me and simply say no. Once you've walked around in public totally hairless and pale while getting looks of pity wherever you go, you become immune to what others think of you. You just don't give a shit. Your outer appearance becomes totally irrelevant because you are too focused on getting well. From the moment I fell into that attitude, it stuck with me. Someone says bad things about me or doesn't like me? So what. Somebody wants me to do something that I don't want to do? Absolutely not! Above all, my well-being comes first.That's what happens when you must strip down your daily routine to only what's essential in order to make it through the day. You get used to setting boundaries. You get used to saying no. And anyone that tries to manipulate me simply must go! That leads me to my next lesson. Lesson 2: I surround myself only with people that are supportive of me and kick those who are not to the curb. The moment you tell everyone you have cancer, you quickly learn who your true friends are and who are not. These people are divided into three groups: 1. Friends and relatives that show their true colors and do whatever they can to help you through a difficult time. 2. Friends and relatives that find it awkward to reach out to you and simply disappear while you're sick. 3. Acquaintances and people you hardly know that step forward and do amazing things to give you a much-needed lift. It is a litmus test of sorts and adds to the emotional roller-coaster of battling cancer. I will always remember the friends that stepped up to the plate and took care of me and will cherish them forever. I will also never forget the friends that I expected to be there for me but turned their backs. They have been kicked out of my life a long time ago. Then there's people like one of my brother's high school buddies that mailed me a box of gifts and a heartfelt card wishing me a full recovery. As soon as I opened the box and read the card, I simply cried. Out of the woodwork, comes people that really care. That's why I make it a point to carry out similar acts of kindness. Lesson 3: I spend less time acquiring things and more time creating memories. Before I was forced to face cancer head-on, I was, in many ways, an empty vessel. I spent way too much time wandering stores buying stuff I didn't need simply out of boredom. Then came a day when I was really sick and an expensive ceramic bowl that I bought in Europe came crashing down on to the kitchen floor. It laid there in tiny, shattered pieces. I looked down at it totally numb and calmly brought out the broom to throw it into the trash. It's just an inanimate object, I thought to myself, and wondered why I even bothered to buy it in the first place. Before I had cancer, I would have probably cried over the broken object. In that moment, I realized what really mattered to me was living life joyously by creating wonderful memories. Things had nothing to do with making that happen. Once again, my perspective changed and I never went back to my old way of thinking. I no longer care about getting Christmas or birthday gifts. I would much rather create a wonderful experience on those special days. And that's what I've been doing ever since. To hell with presents. Lesson 4: I stay in today. I know this live-in-the-present moment concept has been heralded endlessly. But when you are sitting in a chemo room with walls that are painted with names of people that once sat in your lazy-boy chair and are no longer alive, you can't think ahead. It will scare the hell out of you if you do. I had stage-three, locally advanced breast cancer. My prognosis was shaky. I learned to cope with the fact that I may very well die by just taking life day by day. Now, I am very good and keeping worries of the future at bay by doing what I learned to do in the chemo room--staying in the moment. Those are my four big takeaway lessons after battling breast cancer. But I also want to add that I got an unexpected perk for getting cancer. Once my hair started growing back after chemo, it came back curly at first and ever since then it has gone from being straight to wavy. It also got thicker. My hairdresser says part of the reason it's thicker is because I am getting more gray hair. Nonetheless, I am thrilled that my hair has gone from flat, thin and limp, to full, bouncy and wavy--especially during the rain or in humidity. So thanks cancer, for finally giving me great hair! I love my low-maintenance hair, courtesy breast cancer.",0,1,0.05204968944099379
913,50,5,26,1,2016,2016-01-26,"Ever since I was a kid growing up in Minnesota, I have memories of snow blizzards ruining my birthday parties. I was born on January 21st--which is pretty much the apex of bone-chilling winter weather. Last weekend following my birthday on a major blizzard came barreling through the Northeast threatening to spoil yet another birthday celebration. I had a ticket to see the Broadway play, An American in Paris on Saturday night in New York City. As it became clearer by the hour that Manhattan was going into a paralyzing lock-down mode, I chose to ignore the warnings to stay home and jumped on to one of the last Metro North trains heading to New York City before all train service stopped at 4 pm. Halfway through my train ride, a friend texted me that all Broadway plays just cancelled that night--so good luck with that. Undaunted, I called an old friend of mine who happened to be staying at his daughter's apartment in Manhattan while she was out of town. Without hesitation, he invited me to spend the night since I would not be able to leave the city until the next day. As the train rumbled through Harlem I realized how paralyzing the blizzard had become. The roads were devoid of all traffic. People walked down the middle of these ghostly streets just to experience the novelty of this momentous weather event. New Yorkers frolicking in the middle of 69th Street I was hungry when I got to Grand Central station and expected to see the food emporium bustling with activity. Instead, there was one hot dog cart with a long line of people waiting to get something, anything to eat. In fact, the train station was eerily quiet. I took the subway to my friend's place and as soon as I emerged into the streets I was engulfed in a swirling vortex of white snow. I felt completely disoriented and had to ask a passerby to point me in the right direction towards 69th and Third Avenue. I had assumed at least some restaurants would be open so we could go out to eat, but absolutely everything was closed down. When I finally arrived at my friend's doorstep, cold and disheveled, he opened the door and remarked: ""Only you would do something crazy like this."" ""Hey, I'm a Minnesota girl,"" I retorted. As it turned out, he had done the requisite mad dash to the grocery store hours before and announced he would be making us dinner. Once I got warmed up and settled, I stared out the window as people frolicked up and down 69th Street taking selfies on their phones. We spent the evening watching old, classic movies with snacks and drinks sprawled across the coffee table. It was so cozy as we periodically checked the storm outside ebbing and flowing through the night. We woke up the next morning to clear-blue skies and mounds of snow everywhere. Then we trudged through knee-deep drifts to a place that served us a delicious brunch. Apparently the city's mandate to stay inside gave many New Yorkers a serious case of cabin fever because they were out and about in droves. I figured if I went to the theater box office I could negotiate to see the show matinee that Sunday. They obliged discounting my show ticket by 50 percent and giving me a better seat for the inconvenience. As so many great Broadway musicals do, An American in Paris swept me away with its timeless Gershwin tunes and flawless dance scenes. I walked out into Times Square, my senses overwhelmed by the multitude of flashing screens that surrounded me. I took a moment to take it all in and thank my favorite city for the memorable birthday gift it gave me over the past 24 hours. , Despite the blizzard, it was one of the best birthday celebrations I can remember in a long time. It broke my heart to board the train back to Connecticut and leave a city that I have always loved so much, When I got back home and reflected on this magical weekend, I realized that my perspective on celebrating birthdays changed. After battling cancer, I believe my birthday is an affirmation that I won a battle to live. For that reason alone, it is cause for celebration. So do something memorable on your birthday each and every year. You deserve that for having the will to survive. On your special day, make it a mission to party and play. So long Manhattan. I'll miss you.",0,1,0.12722959407742016
915,50,7,19,12,2014,2014-12-19,"Goodbye my sweet Gypsy boy On December 13, just one year and nine days after I lost my beloved Tigger. I had to put my Gypsy boy down. Within five short weeks, his health deteriorated rapidly. It kicked-off with a seemingly harmless virus that gave him a fever and sniffles. Suddenly, his frenetic outbursts of energy, his morning jumps at the front door combined with raucous meows to get out and discover the day gave way to listlessness. I threw him a toy and he just stared at it. Clearly, there was something wrong. The vet said, no worries, he just caught a virus and put him on antibiotics for 10 days as a precaution. During that time, his weight spiraled down inexplicably and his spunky spirit turned to lethargy. But let's not go into the end of his life just now. Let's talk about the beginning. Gypsy is my fourth cat that I had to let go. They all have their special places in my heart. But he was the most feisty one--the scrappy survivor that I discovered living homeless outside during a bitter winter. His rescue story is perhaps the most heartbreaking of all my cats. In February 2008--the month before I found out I had breast cancer--I had seen him roaming through the neighborhood. The condo association was about to contact Animal Control to capture him in which case he would have surely been euthanized. That association seemed like the Wicked Witch of the West, out to kill my little brown ""Todo"" of a cat. With two rescue cats already in my care, I knew it wasn't a good idea to take in a third, but that spunky little brown tabby knew just what to do to capture my heart. He snuck inside my garage to stay warm one night, and before I knew it, I created a sanctuary for him there to survive the winter. I made a bed for him and kept food and water there. I kept the garage door cracked open at the bottom just enough for him to slink inside. By the time spring arrived, he would rush up to me and swirl around my legs until I picked him up. He would purr loudly and look lovingly into my eyes. This was no feral cat. He had been neutered, so at one point in his life, at least someone cared. I announced to all the neighbors on the block that this little brown cat with the crooked ear was mine, so no one better mess with him, much less call Animal Control. Besides, he had turned out to be a working cat by going on midnight runs killing pesky mice and rats. One morning, I found two fat rats lined up neatly dead at the doorstep. Gypsy knew he had to earn his keep. When I took walks, he strutted aside me like a dog. He greeted everyone that stopped to chat by swirling around their legs and giving them a hardy meow. When Gypsy accompanied me to get the mail one day, even the grumpy condo manager mumbled: That cat is really something. During summer, my neighbor upstairs began renovating her kitchen. When her contractor saw my newly-acquired pet he proclaimed: ""I recognize that cat because of his crooked ear! He lived in the house next door to me where the residents had more than 20 cats. They were evicted and rumor had it that they loaded all the cats into a truck and threw them out randomly throughout Fairfield County."" My little brown tabby had come from 15 miles away, which is why I decided to name him Gypsy. Gypsy was truly an outdoor cat. To try and lock him up inside what have crushed an essential part of his spirit. Most of the time, he was content to just sit at the end of my sidewalk like a guard dog and meow at everyone that walked by. If I was down at the pool, he would slide under the gate and saunter toward me meowing loudly with each step. The kids ate it up and asked if they could pet him, what his name was and generally fawn all over him. Their dripping wet suits and hair didn't faze him because he actually loved water. He would always spoon water with his paw in order to drink it. One of my cat-loving neighbors proclaimed Gypsy had some Mainecoon blood in his pedigree because of his water-drinking habits, his constant meowing, his big paws that looked like snow shoes, his fur color and texture and the way he followed me like a dog. I googled the cat breed, and had to agree with him. He didn't have the tufted ears and bushy tail, but he had everything else. When it got cold in Autumn, I decided it was time to bring Gypsy inside the house and meet ""the boys""--Tigger and Mango. Tigger had pressed his nose on the window pane every time he saw Gypsy outside the front door. Once they met face to face, they bonded instantly. Who knows why they loved being together so much. What I do know is that Gypsy greatly enriched the last five years of Tigger's life with his big, loving heart. They spent every night sleeping together on the living room ottoman and groomed each other for hours on end. On two occasions when Tigger accidentally got outside, Gypsy hunted him down and brought him back home. Gypsy was the one that lead me to Tigger as he lay dying of a heart attack in my bedroom. From the moment Tigger died, Gypsy refused to jump on the ottoman he shared with Tigger. It was too painful for both of us to look at that piece of furniture, so eventually I stored it away. Gypsy tried in vain to cuddle up with Mango in an effort to replace that lovable friendship that was now lost from his life. But Mango would have none of it. I could see over the past year how a little light went out from Gypsy's soul when he lost his best buddy Tigger. He missed him terribly. On December 1st, I spent $200 on blood work to find out why Gypsy was losing weight, which yielded no answers to his condition. I refused to pay an additional $350 for a sonogram. So the vet prescribed two weeks of prednisone to see if it was just irritable bowel syndrome. I also bought prescription, high-calorie food that cost $45 for a bag to see if he would gain weight and get back to his old self. It didn't work. He ate all the time, and yet he kept wasting away. He would have a good day and then the next morning I would see he had vomited almost everything he ate. During the last two days of his life, if I touched his rear end, he would cry out in pain. But during those last three weeks, he would climb up on my chest every night as I lay in bed and fall asleep. Occasionally, he would wake me up by softly by tapping my face with his paw. For the first two weeks he purred while his head nestled his head under my chin. But the last two nights of his life, that even stopped. I knew it was time to let him go when he struggled to jump off my bed and limped into a dark corner of my closet. He just stared at me with this sad, forlorn face. It was as if he was saying: ""What are going to do about me? I am sick and tired of this."" When I picked him up out of that corner to take him him on his final journey, he felt like a rag doll--limp and barely alive. During the drive to the vet he uttered not one meow, which is unusual for this cat, because he was always quite loud and verbal. Instead, he pushed his head into my hand every time I touched him in the mesh carrier. At one point in the car, he looked up at the sunlight in the sky and I saw a look of contentment. During our 35-minute ride, I told Gypsy rescuing him was one of the best decisions I had ever made. I explained that very soon, he was about to join his best buddy Tigger. And that was surely something he could get excited about--especially since his life had been full of misery and pain over the past three weeks. As the vet sprawled him out on a cold, metal table during Gypsy's final moments, I looked deep into his eyes and said thank you for all the wonderful memories he gave me. I kissed his head and told him how much I loved him and how much I would miss him. And then I said, go ahead, it's time to join Tigger now. Won't that be fun? With that, he gently and peacefully slipped away. Gypsy and Tigger happy together in heaven It seems that it is no coincidence that Gypsy died practically a year to the day that Tigger passed away. Of course, I miss Gypsy terribly. But I feel good that I acted decisively and decided to put him down swiftly rather than drag out his pain for weeks. Two days before he died, he had a good day, I wanted him to leave on a high note. The day before he died, he was in misery. I did the right thing. It's only been six days since he's been gone. My last remaining rescue cat hasn't missed him a bit and clearly feels lucky that after all these years, he finally has me all to himself again. Mango is 13 or 14 years old now. I know our days are numbered. And I treasure every one of them with him. But just like all my other cats, no one of them will be like my precious Gypsy boy, that I rescued after being thrown off a truck. Thanks, my little love, for seven years of great memories.",0,1,0.10321968253968254

917,55,10,11,1,2016,2016-01-11,"""Mom, are you going to make deviled eggs for the party? I haven't had those in a while."" I hadn't planned that particular menu item, but when your son is home from college and makes a request...well, it becomes reality - at least if this mother has anything to do with it. Damn kid tricked me into loving him and wanting to do things for him. He's 18, a sophomore in college, and 6 foot tall. All I can do for him now is make an egg. (And pay for college.) ""Sure."" I add eggs to my shopping list. We have an appetizer spread Christmas Eve. It's a tradition I started when I married my husband. Previously, the only thing that happened on Christmas Eve was a hopefully Silent Night. Tradition stated that the kids got to open one present in the evening - always new pajamas and a book to read in bed. This ""Mommy, can we open just one present, just one.....pleeeeeease?"" appeasement was supposed to help them sleep on that most exciting of nights. A good book and soft, comfy PJs with a stern warning to stay in bed was wrapped and ready for them each Christmas Eve. Change happens. Being a single mom and marrying a man with two daughters meant I needed to be flexible and get creative about holiday traditions. I knew their mother would want the girls for Christmas, so I tried to find way to make it easy and fun for everybody. I came up with the idea of a Christmas Eve party. I put out a spread, and we drink hot cider, eat a bunch of appetizers, and open gifts before the big day. Christmas Day was the day Santa came for little kids. Christmas Eve became family gift day. Two days of fun, what kid would complain about that? The tradition has stuck over the years, long after Santa moved on and the girls grew up. This year my stepdaughter's son - my beautiful grandchild - is 18 months old - almost old enough to understand something wonderful happens this day. I fear another change will happen soon as they live nearly 100 miles away. At some point, travel might become impossible. But at least for this year, our now firmly entrenched holiday traditions continue. Now is all that counts for any of us. Honoring my son's desire, I stood by the sink, peeling eggs, Christmas music Serial playing in the background. I had boiled just enough eggs to fill all sections of my vintage deviled egg plate. I cracked the next egg and started to peel it. I mindlessly chipped off a piece of shell and then another. I was just prying up a flake here and there with my fingernail. I kept trying, mostly engrossed in the podcast, the egg smooth in my hands, California water immorally flowing from the faucet as I washed off chip after chip. After ten minutes, I suddenly realized I was getting nowhere; the egg was still mostly shell. Chip, bang, flick - tiny piece by piece - that egg would not peel. You've all been there, I'm sure. I tried to get to that air pocket in the ends of the eggs, but nope, it didn't exist. I banged the egg on the counter and rolled it around to crack it fully, but nothing happened, it wouldn't peel. I couldn't find that weird skin in this egg that would allow the shell to slide off. Each time I grabbed a piece with my weak nails, the weaker skin tore. That shell was firmly glued on. Shoot. I'd done 7 eggs with no problem, but the 8th egg was one of ""those"" - the kind that are impossible to open, some sort of genetically mutated glue masquerading as egg. Usually when I come across one of those modest eggs who refused to become undressed, I usually give it up, rip off the white and expose the little green ball of yolk to just use for filling, but this time I needed a whole egg to complete the plate. So there I stood, chipping minuscule pieces off, slowly, like the baby chicken itself was trying to hatch with its tiny soft beak. At the 30 minute mark I said out loud, ""This is ridiculous!"" I cursed myself for only boiling as many as I needed. I realized that my timing for getting the food on the table was behind because of this one, stupid egg. Still, I kept at it. Chip. Chip. Millimeter by millimeter I picked off shell, finally ending up with a whole, perfect egg. Whew. My platter would be complete. My son would have his deviled eggs. A couple of months ago in October, my being able to stand up and make even something simple like a deviled egg seemed an impossibility. I was truly, fearfully sick. I was unable to eat and had lost weight; weight that I could not afford to lose, dipping into the 80s. I was having terrible pain in my abdomen - rolling on the floor pain - pain bad enough so that a normal person would have gone to the hospital. No pain med would help. It gnawed on me even in my sleep. After testing, new cancer was found throughout my abdomen and chest, and I started a new chemo, which made me sick - nauseated, tired, and which incredibly, increased my pain. I was truly feeling like this was the beginning of the end, and there would be no Christmas party, no appetizers, maybe not even a me. I hoped to do our normal Christmas, but I really felt like it wasn't going to happen. Not that I would be dead, but that I'd be in bed. In November I started TDM-1 aka Kadcyla. (All HER2 metastatic woman who have dealt with cancer for a while say that - ""TDM-1 aka Kadcyla"". Most of us watched the progress of this drug through the FDA approval system, so still think of it as the test name) My first infusion was awful, like movie chemo. I was on my hands and knees, vomiting. I had every side effect, from constipation to heartburn to neuropathy. Everything hurt. I felt better just in time to get my next infusion, which was easier on me, the nausea down to just a few days. Then, some of my cancery symptoms were gone. By my third infusion, December 23rd, surprisingly, I felt much better. Pain is now down to a livable level (although it is still more than anybody should have to deal with and that is another blog post) and sometimes, if I'm vewwy vewwy still, I don't hurt at all. I'm still tired but that can be managed, and the nausea, for the most part, is gone. Incredibly, I can eat again, without pain. I will have a scan in the next month or so to see what the treatment is doing, and I feel pretty positive about it. Can I once again be responding to a chemo? I cannot imagine I can feel this normal and still have cancer spreading and growing throughout my system, although by now I know anything can happen. Christmas lives, and so do I. The appetizer party continues. Like all who have metastatic cancer, my mind can be consumed with ""lasts."" As my time on earth dwindles, as I know it is, I wonder more about what will happen when I am gone. What traditions will live on? It may be my last holiday - but will it be the last gathering for my family too? Just as I was the one who decided on the Christmas Eve party, I am also the one who is in charge of all gatherings. Every celebration is spent here: Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, my husband's birthday. The planning, the cooking, the invitations, the timing, the gift purchasing, the entertaining - all decisions, it's all up to me, even these days. My husband now goes to the store for me, and helps clean, but still, for the most part, I am the planner, and fortunately, I have been able to keep it up. What happens when I'm gone? Will my husband continue having family over for Christmas Eve appetizers? For Easter? A barbecue on his birthday? Will he do the planning and work involved, or will he become a guest, invited to one house or another? Will the various sides of our family still gather together or will they all go separate ways as more children enter the mix and travelling gets more difficult? What changes will happen without me being the host, I wonder? I've worked hard for our home to be the touchstone, the place where relationships are renewed and we all catch up, and I wanted it to be the place where we watch the kids grow. Will that happen still? Or, when I am gone, will differences chip away at the family until it is no more? Maybe that would that have happened anyway. It's natural for people to move on and start new traditions, as I did so long ago. It takes work to keep a family together, to keep traditions going. I love family celebrations, enough to spend 30 minutes picking at an egg. Does the rest of my family? I'll never know.",0,1,0.06911787043365988
918,55,11,1,12,2015,2015-12-01,"Tomorrow is my chemo day and my second infusion of Kadcyla/TDM-1. Tomorrow also marks six years since I've been going in. It is my treatment anniversary. December 2nd, 2009 was my first-ever chemotherapy infusion. I remember sitting in the treatment room for the first time, nervous about the chemo I was being given and wondering how my body would react, and feeling like it was all so strange. I got used to going in over time, it even felt familiar, like a second home. Yet of course, I looked forward to the end of therapy. As I finished my original treatment, the nurses gave me a certificate and they all congratulated me. I took a deep, happy breathe and walked out, thinking I would never have to go back and my butt would never touch a barcalounger again. I was grateful to be done. And just three months later, mets were suspected, confirmed in May - and I went right back to the infusion room and that ugly chair. What ""seemed"" endless at the beginning turned out to actually be endless. I have learned how to live with an incurable illness: with the fear, the pain, being sick, losing parts of my life bit by bit. I've learned that all that really matters is the people in your life, and I have learned that most people are incredibly kind. Still, there are many who cannot see past themselves. They are too needy to help you or hear you. Some ignore you and disappear. Some brush off what you say. Some tell you what to do or what not to do as if it is some sort of talisman that will protect them from your fate. Many will not extend the type of kindness to you that you need or ask for; and they are unable to understand the hard place you are in, they can only see themselves. They can't understand the difficulty in learning to face your own death - your obliteration - or understand that you are living with real suffering beyond what they may know. What feels like a lack of caring and dismissal hurts more than it would if you were healthy and not experiencing your impending death, because you know there is no time for change or understanding. It feels hopeless, and so rather than try to explain or continue on, we must let go for our own mental health. One wants to imagine that somebody will wake up and understand, but the reality is that they will not - even after you have died. Their own viewpoint is the only one they can see. Many people go through life that way, with blinders on, not only unable to see you, but unable to see anybody. But this makes the ones who do try to understand, who are generous and humble and kind, who try to learn, so much more special. And if you reading this, you fall into that category, and I'm grateful for you. When I originally started my blog and my facebook page, I did it because I wanted to let people know that it was possible to get through cancer treatment and to the other side. I had no doubt that is where I would be. I am a normal person, nobody special, had no amazing life, was a school secretary and a mom. If I can do cancer treatment, anybody can. So I described the tests, the mastectomy, chemo, biopsies - I wrote about what it was like from my perspective, to demystify cancer treatment for anybody who came along and wanted to know what it was like. When I -shockingly- found out that death would be my outcome, I decided to keep it up. We need to demystify death in this country too - we are so far away from it. So now I write from the point of view of somebody who will not survive cancer. And many people can accept that, and some - well, they cannot. I am still here, six years later. It is increasingly unlikely that I will be here in another six years. Even six months seems iffy these days, although I am early into my latest chemo and I can be lucky and have it shrink my tumors. I imagine I will find that out in a couple months. But now my life is harder, and full of pain. I don't want this blog to be a litany of complaints, but I also want it to be true. They say that when it is in your liver it isn't very painful, but mine is now across my abdomen and in the lungs. So there is certainly pain that I am having difficulty controlling. There is no doubt that the end feels much closer than it used to, but that may be the pain talking. I don't think dying of cancer is a very easy thing to do. Remember, what we Stage 4 metsters want most is understanding, so if you know one of us, the kindest thing you can do is just listen. Happy Anniversary to me. .",0,1,0.11567193675889324
919,55,12,29,11,2015,2015-11-29,"So, your loved one has advanced cancer, is not eating, and you want to help. First, please read part one. You must understand that what you think is a loss of appetite is more than that - it's a true physical inability to eat. It's a symptom and a complication of disease and not something we control with willpower. No matter how much you beg and cajole, eating regular, normal meals is a medical impossibility and will only cause more stress. You might as well be begging somebody with a broken femur to get up and run a marathon. I also want to make clear that I am not talking about the common loss of appetite that happens in an early stage cancer patient due to chemo, surgery, or as a medication side effect. Depression and some medications can also cause a lack of appetite in early stage cancer patients, and so appropriate diagnosis and medications may help. Any lack of appetite should be discussed with a doctor. I am talking about something very different. I am talking about what happens to an end-stage, terminal cancer patient - anorexia-cachexia. This is a wasting condition where muscle is lost, metabolism is revved up yet food desire disappears, and it happens because of their disease, not because of treatment. Those who have cancer anorexia-cachexia experience it even when we are off treatment. Mine started before I started the new chemo, when the cancer (unbeknownst to me) began spreading again but when I was on the same therapy I'd been on for 2 years. So what can you, as a caretaker, do to help? I will tell you what has worked for my home, and you can adapt this for yourself. Communication: Don't ask the patient to make food decisions. I do not want to be asked what I feel like eating, because the answer is nothing. My husband used to say ""What do you want for breakfast?"" or ""Do you want eggs or pancakes?"" ""Do you want soup for dinner?"" I truly cannot answer that question because I don't want anything. And not only do I not want it - it makes me angry to think about. Angry, frustrated, annoyed....You might as well ask me, ""Do you want to be stabbed in the lung or the liver?"" Neither! I truly cannot make food decisions at this point. I told my husband that he is not allowed to talk to me about food. Bring me food or don't, cook or don't, but leave me out of it. I won't acknowledge that question and he has stopped. All decisions about food are his. I think I eat a tiny bit more since he stopped asking me and just started giving it to me. Shop: Put yourself in the role of decision maker. For husbands, or at least for mine, this may be something they aren't used to. I shopped and I cooked. Now I am beyond shopping for food. I used to go to Whole Foods and buy all the things I'd love in the hopes I could eat, yet it would rot in the fridge. Now, I don't even want to see it, my stomach roils just thinking about food. So, take it upon yourself to shop for your loved one. Try to keep the things you know she'll eat on hand, and keep the things you hope she'll eat around too. Don't worry so much about nutrition as much as intake. If all I can eat is cake or 3 musketeers mini-bars, well, make sure I have cake or candy in the house. Don't substitute what you believe is healthy - it's not going to be healthy if we can't tolerate eating it. Take Control of Food for your Loved One: Bring foods every few hours. While I won't make a food decision, I also don't want to be on my own with food intake because frankly, I wouldn't eat. At all. I know mentally I have to eat but cannot tolerate the thought or the pain that comes later, and most food sounds disgusting now - so I need help. Despite the fact that everything but candy sounds awful, if something is put in front of me at dinner, I sometimes eat it. I have no appetite and won't ask for it, but if a cup of hot soup, or a cup of tea and cookie is placed in front of me on a cold day, I might sip it. Maybe just a sip ... but it's something. If a tiny plate of fruit and cheese is placed in front of me at lunch, I might nibble at it. (Tiny being a few grapes and a tablespoon of cheese). I certainly won't get it myself and if you ask me if I want it, the answer is an unequivocal no. If it magically appears without questions or expectations, maybe I'd try. Maybe I wouldn't. But it is better than talking about it, which I am certain to not respond to. Size Counts. Food hurts, we don't want to see it. Don't put a big bowl or plate of anything in front of me. It hurts to even look at it. Keep it small. Light and airy. I don't know why looking at a big plate of food bothers me but it does. Notice taste changes. Cachexia can cause things to taste weird. Keep our new likes in mind. If I can't stand garlic anymore, don't put it in anything we share, even if you like it and even if you know I used to love it. Now, it's different. I can no longer tolerate onions, garlic, or any kind of intense flavor but used to put them in everything. I still like salty food. I like popcorn with no butter. And sugar is something I never cared about but now like. Taste changes can make things we enjoyed formerly undesirable. So pay attention and make sure those things we now like are on hand. Choices: Provide tasty foods. My husband is a truly terrible cook. (Sorry hon.) I finally tried a food subscription service, where meals are delivered with recipes. It's expensive and I hate that I have to pay for that with a kid in college - but that said, I eat a bit of it. There are several of these services. They give you choices of meals weekly and deliver them to your home. The right amounts are sent with recipes, and my husband just has to put the meals together. They are creative and flavorful, and I like them. That doesn't mean I can eat a full meal, but when I taste something that is good, I can usually eat a few bites. When it was him cooking on his own, I had no incentive at all to eat. Taste still counts, even if we like fewer and fewer things. Diet: The time to worry about nutrition is over. Nutrition is important when you are an early stage cancer patient regaining your health. Everyone should eat well. But when we are this sick, and hardly able to eat, getting calories in is more important than a balanced diet. My oncologist says any calorie is a good one. Your ideas about perfect nutrition have to go out the window at this late stage. That doesn't mean you shouldn't give a cancer patient nutritious foods, but only if they will eat it. Give little balanced nutritious meals through the day and see what the patient eats. If it's pretzels and grapes, that is better than nothing. Nagging: Don't. We know. We really do. If you get the urge to nag, do something instead. Put small amounts of food in front of a cancer patient without asking a couple times a day - and take it away whether it's eaten or not, and say nothing. Ignore your feelings of upset, time/money wasted or rejection if it isn't eaten. What's the ultimate goal? Your feelings, or helping a cancer patient with a symptom? Know you tried. You showed your love. It's better than nagging. If you want to help, this is what help looks like. If you don't, that is fine, understandable really - nobody really wants to be responsible for another adult's food intake. Just don't put it back on us, which is what nagging does. Remember, you can't force us to eat. You can't talk us into it. All you can do is tempt us and make it easier. If we can't do it, you did your best. Not only did you try to help us, you did it leaving our dignity intact. You can remember that with pride. Understanding. Truly learn this isn't within our control. Imagine, if you were forced to eat something disgusting and got punched in the stomach with every bite which then caused hours of pain - eventually you wouldn't want to eat either, even if you had an appetite. When you have no desire for food and a food revulsion, when your body doesn't want food any more and with each bite there is real pain - it doesn't take long to learn to stop. Try to understand how hard it is for us. Try to understand that it is out of our control, and that it is our bodies doing this and not our minds. Bottom line: If one of the symptoms of having a disease is a runny nose, hand us a tissue, don't try to convince us to make our nose stop running. Do remember, it's nobody's fault. You can't talk us out of pain, you can only bring us a pill. You can't make us not tired, you can only let us rest. You also can't make us able to eat, you can only provide foods and leave the rest to us. We want comfort, love and acceptance, especially at the end, not fights about food. More resources: Why do cancer patients lose weight rapidly American Cancer Society (halfway down the page) (By the way, while this says it happens in the last 3 months of life. Like everything with cancer, there is a continuum. I've already experienced it for longer than 3 months. Most people do stop eating as part of the dying process no matter what disease they have, and it is a sign that time is short. But others can go this way for a while, my mother did for about 2 years (she did, of course, get quite a lot of calories from alcohol). I don't think I'm within 3 months of death although my next scan will be telling. It is becoming clear that this disease is going to win for sure and I will not be one of those who gets ten years.

920,55,13,23,11,2015,2015-11-23,"In some people, cancer causes ""loss of appetite."" Only it's not really a mere loss of appetite; there is no good medical description for what really happens. I know because I'm experiencing it. From a site about this topic: ""..the inability to eat and the associated weight loss often causes conflicts within relationships. In fact, nutrition and nutritional status have a central position in the concept of health and wellbeing for many patients and care givers, and weight loss and inadequate nutritional intake can lead to anxiety and a feeling of hopelessness. Available data suggest that patients and their families view poor appetite as the most distressing symptom they encounter during cancer treatment."" And what happens is that family members, not knowing what else to do, nag us to eat. Cancer patients aren't alone in this ""loss of appetite."" Liver disease, HIV, heart failure, kidney disease and others can cause it, either temporarily or permanently. But since I write about cancer, I have to say that it is very common in people with advanced cancer, especially those of us who have it in our GI area. No, not everybody has it, but plenty do. There is a formal name for this: ""anorexia-cachexia syndrome."" It's why you picture a dying cancer patient as wraith-like; like Steve Jobs. Let's just say that at a certain point in the disease, most of us are not really worried about keeping our figures. I know that it is very disturbing for family to watch their loved one wither away, especially when you think that it's because they don't eat. You are puzzled when they turn down food or only eat a few bites and won't can't do anymore. You may even get angry. ""Don't you know you have to eat?"" you say, exasperated. You may believe that they are being ornery, or don't realize how little their food intake is, or are just not hungry and should eat anyway. ""If they will just eat,"" you think ""maybe they could get better."" So you nag. You believe that it is within the sick person's control - mind over matter. Force it down. Just eat, dammit! I understand this thinking all too well. My mother died of cirrhosis of the liver and she barely ate for the last years of her life. She was about 70 pounds at her death, and she was normally in the 130s. Naturally, this caused incredible distress for my father. My parents were never big eaters, but after they retired and moved to Nevada, they did enjoy going out to lunch every day and eating a sandwich or steak. They rotated restaurants; my dad, the big flirt, always chatting up the waitresses. At some point, my mother stopped ordering food. (Although not wine.) Because it was their only meal of the day, she began losing weight. And more weight. At that time, she didn't have a diagnosis of anything wrong, so nobody understood what was happening or why. In frustration, my Dad asked me to come and cook for them, thinking home-cooked meals might tempt her. Being a dutiful daughter, I took a week off work (this was ironically just a couple weeks before I was diagnosed with cancer.) I spent time cooking all of my mother's favorite meals, freezing leftovers so at least my Dad would have something to eat. I knew it would do no good for my mother - but I, too, believed it was because she was stubborn. I thought she lost her appetite because of her drinking but could eat if she wanted to. Knowing she wouldn't listen to her daughter, I didn't spend any time trying to talk her into it. But my dad was hopeful my cooking would help, and during her afternoon naps, he would tell me about his worry. The rest of my family spent time literally begging her to eat. He and the rest of the family told her how much her body needed food, encouraged her to ""take one bite,"" and all the rest of the things she, as a smart woman, already knew. Her only response to these many entreaties was to shrug, light a cigarette and pour a scotch. Now we know she was sick from end-stage liver disease. And now, sick from end-stage cancer, I see the other side of this food story. The only difference for me is I don't get any calories from alcohol. My mother didn't have the capability of explaining what was going on with her - but I do. And not only do family members need to hear it, medical professionals do too. First, you must understand that while they call it is a ""loss of appetite,"" it is much bigger than that. You may be able to eat when you aren't hungry - we can't. This problem of being unable to eat is not a matter of will-power, nor is it in our control. It is a symptom, a complication of our disease, same as a runny nose caused by a cold. Pleading with us to eat is like begging somebody with a cold to stop their nose from running. The patient wants it to stop too - but it cannot happen, they have no control. They aren't being stubborn or willful because they cannot command their body to stop making mucus. They literally, physically, cannot. This is the same thing. While the reasons for this syndrome are not well-understood, scientists do know that it is a metabolic problem. There is even a name for it - cancer anorexia cachexia. I'm not going to be able to explain this well, but you can search for it if interested. Very simply, tumors release destructive proteins which tell cells to produce an inflammatory reaction which can cause a loss of appetite.These proteins can also cause muscle atrophy and can be the cause of altered taste changes, among many other problems. It's a whole metabolic cascade response caused by end-stage cancer: ""..anorexia describes loss of appetite and/or an aversion to food. The term “cachexia” refers to a loss of body mass, including lean body mass and fat, in the setting of a disease state, in this case cancer. - See more at: http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management/anorexia-and-cachexia#sthash.Hw0aa190.dpuf "" ""Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment”. [Fearon, Lancet Oncol 2011]"" It is physical, and it isn't a problem somebody can mentally talk themselves out of. Not even me. I do have a loss of appetite although that phrase does not encompass all that I experience. Appetite isn't the same as hunger. I wouldn't say I never feel hungry because there are times when I am hungry, although not the way I used to be. People think I should smoke weed, or get some prescription drug that will increase my appetite, but being hungry is really not the problem; it's what happens after I'm hungry that is the problem. Eating is the problem. I have no desire for food, even if I get hungry. In fact, food is repulsive to me. Just the idea of eating makes me uncomfortable. I used to be a foodie, and cooking was a hobby. I enjoyed watching TV shows about food and trying new recipes. My husband and I thought when we were retired we'd eat out regularly, trying new restaurants, travelling to places like Chez Panisse. My town has a good food scene. I used to know when restaurants opened, and I intended to sample it all. Now, food is revolting. Even when I do feel hungry, the idea of eating grosses me out. As my husband shared, he does the cooking now, and he frequently asks me what I want to eat, because of course, he wants me to like what he cooks. But the answer is nothing! I don't want to eat, it is unpleasant to even think about it. Angering even. Food is no longer desirable. It's an intense annoyance. The things I used to like don't taste good to me anymore, and not only that, the texture seems weird. I used to love eggs - I could eat eggs every day. Loved them fried, scrambled, poached, hard/soft boiled, on salads and pasta, you name it. Now they taste sour. And the texture is nasty. A scrambled egg seems to have a gritty texture, like it's filled with sand. An egg over-easy, the way I loved them, is like oil. I can't even remember what I liked about them. Anything creamy seems oily to me which is why I can't tolerate those Boost type drinks. I physically react to food that I no longer like - just a few swallows and my throat closes and I wretch from disgust. Giving me food is like putting a plate of crickets in front of me and expecting me to eat it. I think of the crunchy legs in my teeth and shiver. Just....no. There are still foods I like. Fresh fruit. Oddly, I like sweets now, candy, like a little kid. My husband buys whoppers for me. I can't eat an entire candy bar but a couple whoppers give me the sweet I want without hurting my stomach too much. Hurting: I feel very full, very fast. I eat three grapes (or whoppers) and I feel like I ate a Thanksgiving meal. Fruit hurts for a lesser amount of time, which is why I like it. If I eat a regular meal, say a piece of chicken, potatoes and vegetable, it's like I ate a full Thanksgiving meal - twice - and added four pieces of pie. My stomach hurts from the cancer anyway and adding this fullness to it becomes overwhelming. Feeling full has always been uncomfortable for me; it's probably why I've always been thin. But now being full is more than uncomfortable. It's pain, real pain, true pain, not happy ""Oh I overate, groan pain."" I feel like I've been punched in the stomach and my meal consisted of knives stabbing me from the inside. It feels like my stomach is full of rocks, and I'm weighed down, and each movement causes pain. And it can take 8-10 hours to digest and go away. Because it's hard to stand for a long time, and my feelings about food have turned unpleasant, my husband does all the cooking. I do eat a meal at dinner. Not a big meal, but a meal. My husband needs to eat and by dinnertime, that's when I also try to eat. But when my body says to stop eating, I have to or I get sick and feel pain. Not nauseated sick, just painful, repellent sick. I'll wretch if I overdo it. I had a big meal the other night - a babyback rib and a 1/4 cups of greens. To me, these days, that is a lot of food. I'd be shocked if I ate 500 calories a day. And then, after dinner, the pain comes and can hurt for hours. Still, I get as much in as I can. That IS forcing myself because my desire and inclination is to never eat again. But I know it's not much. My body simply rejects food and it's beyond my control. I weigh 89 pounds now. That really isn't as terrible as you might think, because my normal weight hovers at around 100. I think I was 104 when diagnosed. My highest weight ever not pregnant was 107 so I'm really not as thin as it sounds. But just 2 months ago, I was 95 and it had been steady at 96-97 for a year, so we are going in the wrong direction. I don't eat much but it's the same amount I ate 3 months ago. So the cancer is clearly changing my metabolism. I am starting to look pretty skeletony. My hip bones show, my rear end is completely gone and my jeans, a Size 00, hang on me. Being this thin is uncomfortable - sitting hurts, sleeping can hurt, bones clang against bones. I sit reading with my knees up and my silly husband likes to come up and kiss my knee. I'm afraid he's going to get a cut. I am trying to describe this for those of you who are living or caring for somebody with end stage cancer (or other disease) and who is starting to experience this problem. I want you to understand that it isn't their fault. And it isn't YOUR fault. You can't make somebody eat, and here is what you must understand - they can't make themselves eat. It's distressing for all involved. I know it is hard for you to watch. You want so badly for us to get healthy and survive longer and we know that. Remember, it is hard for us too. We want all that too, and have the added burden of knowing our loved ones don't understand, and think we aren't trying hard enough. No cancer patient should feel upset at themselves or feel like they are disappointing others for having a disease. And this is a symptom of a disease. When you nag us about eating, you make us know we are hurting you. We feel guilty that we can't do something that seems so easy. Many cancer patients do not even understand this is part of the disease process and not in our control, so we are upset at ourselves, and think we are doing cancer wrong. So if you are living with an anorexic cancer patient - and you understand now that suggesting/nagging/begging us to eat won't be effective - does that mean you can do nothing? No. I have suggestions. This is getting long, so I will write a part II about what is, in my opinion only, the best thing to do for us.",0,-1,-0.016451948867203116
921,55,14,14,11,2015,2015-11-14,"November is National Family Caregivers' Month. My husband is the one who does most of what we know as ""caregiving."" Recently, I asked him, ""what is it like? What does being a caregiver mean to you?"" Our plans for life and dreams for the future have certainly ...changed. Things we thought we'd be doing, we will never get to do. Tasks that I did happily and without thinking have fallen to him. I don't think he thought of himself as a caregiver, and I do my best to not have my disease physically impact my family more than it must, but of course, somebody has to take up the slack. I wondered what he thought about it. I was delighted to see that he wrote down what he had been thinking for the blog. And then, of course, it made me sad. Below is what he said. True Companions “The Caregiver” Pre C Ann and I were married relatively late in life; I was 47 and she was 36. We each had children, and were a family of five right away. We bought a house and moved in together five months before our wedding, which we held in our backyard, surrounded by family and friends. We were very happy. With a backyard wedding, you can do things the way you want, and one of the things I've always liked to do is put together sets of music. They would be called “Playlists” today, but we just called them “tapes”. The first song on the tape was used as a backyard wedding march. It was a song called “True Companion” by Marc Cohn, and was a song we both liked very much. Its opening verse is about a young couple beginning their lives together. My daughter started the playback when Ann and her father started to walk, and ended it when she arrived where I was standing, at the completion of that verse. But there is more to “True Companion” than that verse. It goes on to talk about the companions as they grow older. When the years have done irreparable harm I can see us walking arm in arm. Just like that couple on the corner do Girl, I will always be in love with you. I thought about how that might go for us. Being more than 10 years older than Ann, and given that women, on average, live four years longer than men, I knew that there was a distinct possibility that Ann would outlive me, and I did all my financial planning to make sure I would leave Ann in a good living situation when my end came. Oh, sure, I'm a healthy guy, and my parents lived into their mid-80s, but 14 years is a big spot. Two-plus years later it became even more critical when our youngest son was born. But, emotionally, I just knew that we would get to those golden years when it was just us, and we could do the things we had always wanted to do as Senior Citizens. “What the heck is that?” Most of you have read Ann's early blog posts, so I thought I'd borrow her opening question. But first, a little background on me. I rarely show emotions, especially negative ones. My maternal grandparents were English immigrants and, through my mother, “stiff upper lip” was part of my makeup. I also consider myself a problem solver. So, rating people on the Kirk/Spock Continuum, I am way Spock. Those of you more to the Kirk side will have different reactions than the ones I'll be describing here. Anyway, when Ann came out of the bathroom and showed me the lump she had discovered in her breast, my thoughts went to what else it could be besides cancer. Not denial, really, just trying to identify other, less ominous, possibilities. Like a benign cyst, for instance. I'd had those. Ann is one of those people who wants to do everything herself, especially medical appointments. And the appointment to find out what the lump was was no exception. I was at lunch, walking through Capitol Park, when she called me with the results. In a calmer tone than you might expect she told me that her lump was cancer and she had a referral to a surgeon. I tried to remain calm as well, and told her that I would be going with her to see the surgeon. She didn't object. The appointment with “Rockstar Raja” went well. He said that Ann's tumor was Stage 2 and that the combination of a mastectomy and follow up chemo was likely to result in a cure. That made me feel a little better. He also referred Ann to a plastic surgeon to work on her reconstruction, which surprised me a little. Both surgeons would do surgery at the same time; Dr. Raja first, and then the plastic surgeon. “No oncologist?”, I asked. No, he said, those come later. Surgery #1 The mastectomy and initial plastic surgical procedures went well, and Dr. Raja reported that the margins were clear. So my immediate reaction was one of relief. The cancer was in the bio-waste bin and chemo would be a precaution, to make sure it didn't reappear. Looking back, that was terribly naive, but I'm a “glass half full” kind of guy, and that's what I thought. You catch it early you live, right? A digression: I am writing this because several people have asked me what it is like to be a “caregiver” for my wife. I have a hard time with that question, because I don't really consider myself a caregiver. My wife has physical problems, and I need to help her with them. A very Spock way to think, I suppose, but that's me. Ann is a very strong woman emotionally (as you can tell from reading her blog), but there would be times when I needed to do more in the way of emotional support, and I usually was a couple of counts late on those. I wish I had been better. After the mastectomy Ann had trouble moving, and lifting and driving were out of the question. So I took her everywhere she needed to go, which were mainly medical appointments, since she really didn't want to go anywhere else. Post Op care was mostly provided by the plastic surgeon, and I learned how to deal with emptying the drain bag that goes with surgeries involving the lymphatic system. I took her to meet the oncologist, and to the first few chemo sessions. But as soon as Ann was able to drive I quit going to those, at her request. Surgery #2 Ann had very simple, and clear, requirements for her breast reconstruction: she wanted to look good in clothes. But the process turned out to be much more problematic than the mastectomy had been. Although we didn't know it at the time, the plastic surgeon was dealing with his own health issues. He scheduled the first procedure, and then canceled it at the last minute. I took Ann to the hospital, and she even “gowned up” before the nurse came in after a long wait and told us that the surgery had been canceled. Something about the hospital not having the right kind of stuff on hand. So Ann put her clothes back on and we left. Emotion on that particular day,shared by both Ann and I, was anger, with a side of frustration. As those of you who have been through it already know, breast reconstruction is not the same as a Boob Job. Both involve the same body part (sort of), and both are done by plastic surgeons, but the requirements, issues, and results are very different. In Ann's case, one of the results was a frozen shoulder. She was unable to raise her arm more than a foot or so from her side. It made things like getting dressed difficult and painful. It was also semi-permanent. While it has improved some over the ensuing years, her shoulder is still not right. It sent a very important message to us – even if you beat cancer, you will never truly be the same after its treatment. Mets Ann didn't beat cancer after all. She was left with more than a missing breast and a frozen shoulder; she was left with cancer. Cancer treatment, in addition to causing a number of health issues, like hair loss, slipping blood counts, and a host of other conditions, doesn't go on forever in most early stage patients. Most eventually become “No Evidence of Disease” (NED). At that point, treatment stops, and breath holding starts. While you are happy to be out of treatment, and on the road to good (or at least pretty good) health, there is a background concern that the cancer may come back. And, within a few months, it did. We were first surprised, and then devastated. We'd seen the movie on the development of Herceptin, and it seemed like it would lead to a cure. But it didn't. I didn't go with Ann to see the oncologist when he discussed the new scan results with her. He told her that the cancer had spread to her liver. But he put a positive spin on it; the cancer was only in her liver, and there were only two tumors. He ordered up new chemo and the treatment process was on again. Likely for good this time. The average survival for a Stage 4 patient with Ann's kind of cancer is two years. And the Two Years to Live clock had started. Surgery #3 Ann likes her oncologist very much, and she has enough trust in him to be able to take bad news with an “OK, now what do we do?” attitude. He was aware of a surgeon in San Francisco who was doing liver resections on Stage 4 cancer patients with good results, including long periods of remission. (Nobody says “cure” for a Metster; a long period of remission is as good as it gets.) He referred us to that surgeon, who agreed to see Ann as a possible surgical candidate. So off to San Francisco we went. The trip is only about 90 miles, but involves some of the worst traffic this side of downtown LA. Hard to remain positive when you are inching toward the Bay Bridge. Anyway, when we got in to see the surgeon he said he needed more scans before agreeing to do the surgery. (SF scans are apparently better than Sac scans. Who knew?) After the scans, and another trip (or two; I don't remember) to San Francisco, he agreed to do the surgery, at UC San Francisco. He would remove half of Ann's liver, containing the larger of her two tumors, and then try to remove just the tumor from the other side. At various times, our sons, daughter, Ann's sister, and I were all in SF doing whatever we could to send positive vibes, for both the surgery and the post-op recovery period. The surgery mostly went well, but the smaller tumor was too deeply embedded in her liver and couldn't be removed, so he ablated (burned) it. The Two Years to Live clock had been reset. Abdominal surgery is rough, and we had another 90 mile trip to navigate. We propped up Ann with pillows the best we could, and started out. I've never been so aware of my driving in my life, as a tried to avoid anything that might make the car bounce. I must have done pretty well, because Ann slept most of the way. C. Diff The recovery from the liver resection was going well, and things were getting back to the new normal (not to be confused with the old normal). We even held Thanksgiving at our house, as usual. But what I didn't know was that Ann had begun to have diarrhea. It got worse, and she told me what was going on, sending me to the store for Imodium. And then it got much worse, to the point where on the evening of Black Friday, she said it was time to go to the ER. When the ER doctors heard about the recent liver resection and hospital stay they had a pretty good idea about what it was – a serious bacterial infection, C. Diff. Tests showed they were right, and they admitted Ann to the hospital, and straight to the ICU, with full protective clothing for everyone involved. Ann not only had C-Diff, she had sepsis. Visits to the ICU by people who didn't have to be there were discouraged and, with a son at home, I mostly stayed away, visiting the ICU only once. After a couple of days in the ICU, they moved her into a regular room, but still with all the Hazmat conditions. I was told to thoroughly clean everywhere she had been at home, because the C. Diff bacteria can live for an extended period of time outside the body, and is not only dangerous to the person with the infection, but to everyone who has come in contact with the places she had been. So I washed all the linen and towels in hot water and bleach, and cleaned the two bathrooms she had used with bleach as well. I also bought disposable hand towels, to reduce the risk of infection even further. I am not, by nature, a germophobe, and generally consider clutter to be a bigger problem than dirt, but not this time. This was serious, not only to Ann but to our son and me. Early tests showed only partial success in beating back the infection. She was still at risk of having the infection spread again throughout her body, almost certainly killing her. To keep that from happening, the alternative would be to remove her colon, a procedure with a 80% mortality rate. Fortunately, her test numbers improved with treatment and she got to keep her colon, and I got to keep my wife. But it was a very scary few days. As it turns out, the scaryness for me was just beginning. They discharged Ann from the hospital mid-day Friday, a week after we went to the ER. She wasn't cured, by any means, but the treatment, a very powerful antibiotic, was working and could be continued at home. They gave her a prescription for the antibiotic and, after bringing Ann home and getting her comfortable, I took it to our regular pharmacy. And that's when things got scary for me. The pharmacy didn't have the medicine in stock, and wouldn't be able to get any until Monday at the earliest. Monday seemed to me to be so far in the future that it would never come. And, for Ann, it might not have. An incompletely cured infection is worse than an untreated one, and I had a very real fear that my wife would be dead, or having her colon removed, by Monday. The pharmacy called others in our area, with the same result – nothing until at least Monday. So I called the hospital to see if they could give us enough to get Ann through the weekend. They said that they couldn't. Ann had left the hospital with some open but unused product, enough for one more dose. But that was it; they were not allowed to dispense drugs to outpatients. (Whose stupid rule was that?! ) They did give me a suggestion,though – to call pharmacies associated with other hospitals, figuring they would be the best bet to have some. So I did that, with my first call to the pharmacy associated with the downtown hospital where Ann had her first surgery. They had some, and said I could get it right away. Whew! A little while later, a co-worker asked me how Ann was doing. I said she was improving daily, and then shared some other thoughts with her. I said that with metastatic cancer you knew that, barring some other calamity, you would die from cancer. But it wouldn't be today, or this month, or, quite possibly, this year. So you could establish a regular way of doing things for the near future. But with C. Diff the situation was different. It was entirely possible, almost likely, that you would die today. Or tomorrow. It is a very different, and overwhelming situation. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Meals Up to this point, this rambling narrative has been in chronological order, and will return to that in the next section. But, since the original question was about being a caregiver, I want to work this in. In our Pre C, life Ann did pretty much all the cooking, and continued doing that whenever she felt up to it. I did some BBQ in the summer, but even then Ann did the rest of the meal. When she didn't feel well I would “cook”things like Hamburger Helper or other easy to fix meals. But at this point, her appetite was near normal, and she grew tired of what I was preparing very quickly. She asked me to get a cookbook and see if I could put something better on the table. So, absent even things like knife skills, I started down the road of being the chief meal preparer. Today, I do pretty much all the cooking. The need to have good food on the table has become even more critical lately, as Ann has lost her ability to enjoy most food. A cancer-induced anorexia, if you will. So it's up to me to get her to eat, and not lose any more weight. I do my best. Remission; Retirement Eventually, a scan showed that the remaining tumor after the liver resection, the one that had been ablated, had become active again. Ann's oncologist recommended a radiation treatment called the “Gamma Knife”, along with some new drugs in her once every 3 weeks infusions. She agreed to the plan and had the Gamma Knife procedure. The Two Years to Live clock was, once again, reset. But it got better. The treatment had worked so well that a subsequent scan showed that Ann was, for the first time in a long time, NED. Remission! The Two Years to Live clock was on hold! At first, it seemed hard to believe. But as the months rolled by, this NED thing had become the new normal. If only Ann had felt better. Even without active cancer, Ann really didn't feel well, a major disappointment. Meanwhile, my situation at work was changing. When our son was born, the Math major in me quickly figured out that I would need to work until 70 to get him through college. As I said before, I'm a healthy guy who actually enjoyed his job, so setting my sights on 70 wasn't that hard. For one thing, it would improve my retirement income. The State Of California retirement system gives a number of options for how to take your money in retirement, but they mainly come down to getting a larger amount until you die, or a smaller amount until you and your wife both die. As I said in the opening section, for me the choice was easy, given our age difference. But the choice didn't need to be made until retirement, and when Ann was diagnosed Stage 4 my retirement date, in 2017, seemed impossibly far away for her. But I didn't make it to 2017. In 2012, upon the retirement of my boss, I was named Acting CIO at my department. Those assignments are supposed to last no more than a year, but mine drug on for 20 months, until they finally hired a new permanent CIO, returning me to my old job, in May 2013. I was fine with that. My new boss? Not so much. For whatever reason, she clearly wanted me gone. And, since I was in an “at will” position, she could demote me at any time, with only 20 days notice. I had almost a year of vacation time on the books, and to keep it from losing value I would have to have taken it as a lump sum payment within the 20 days. More income (good), but more taxes (bad). Or I could accept a demotion and use the vacation over the next few years, until my preferred retirement date of 2017. But then I, once again, did the math. With 30 years of service, my retirement benefit would be 75% of my salary. Seems like a big cut. But then I realized that a lot of deductions, like Social Security and Retirement Contributions stop when I retired. So I did some calculations base on Take Home pay, and found that it would only be reduced by $400 a month in retirement. Not too bad. Then I calculated what my take home pay would be if I stayed working but was demoted. It would drop by $1000 a month. Even if I liked my job, which by then I didn't, I wasn't going to pay the State $600 a month for the privilege of working. This was in November 2013. I told my boss that I was going to start “vacationing out”, and retire in September 2014. I was officially unworking, although getting paid as if I were still working. When September 2014 rolled around Ann was still NED. Remission was feeling more and more like the “real normal”, and Ann was, once again, 10+ years younger than me. So the decision was easy; take the reduced amount and provide for my family after I'm gone. Now As Ann and I both knew, but were reluctant to acknowledge, Remission in a Stage 4 cancer patient is temporary, as much as we wish it weren't. A new scan showed that the cancer was once again active, and no longer confined to her liver. The Two Years to Live clock was once again in motion. She has started a new chemo regimen, but it is too early to tell how effective it will be. Also, given that she is in constant pain and the new chemo is making her sick, it's hard to be optimistic. But there may well be more remission in her future, and we can't completely dwell on the present. Just deal with it, and see what comes next. When Ann was first diagnosed Stage 4, she set her sights on seeing our son graduate from high school. She did that. The next big event will be our older son's wedding, six months from now. The oncologist has said she'll make that one, too, and she is helping with the planning and worrying about what to wear, just like any mother of the groom would do. She's not done wanting to live, and I'm in no way tired of my role as caregiver, whatever that means. So we still live in the present. There's no rush in thinking farther ahead than that.",0,1,0.11908514104942672

I am trying to keep to a schedule and upload one every aka Mets Monday. If I don't give myself a deadline, I don't do things. They are silly and unprofessional, but I am just learning. It's slightly irritating that I'm struggling to figure out how to make something that my kid, and pretty much every kid, knows how to do instinctually by age 9. How do these young people just know this stuff, anyway? My son once created a stop-motion video of a puzzle game putting itself together, and he did it quickly and perfectly - pretty much the first time he ever made a video. He just shrugged when I was amazed. It would take me weeks to figure that out, and I can't even blame chemo-brain here. As much as I want to blame every mental mistake or bit of slowness on chemo-brain, there are times I have to admit that I'm just suffering from being in my 50s. Now my child is off in college and is waaaay too busy to teach me how to use this software, so I hobble along on slow, misfiring synapses.

924,55,4,29,2,2016,2016-02-29,"This month, I have been fortunate enough to have had visits from my oldest dearest friend, as well as my sister. Many of you canceristas and metsters are lucky enough to have loved ones who visit. But tell me, do they always behave the way the way you wish they would? Of course their intentions might be good, but their thoughtlessness sometimes shows. Insensitive behavior happens most often when we don't appear sick. When we look normal, people forget our illness, especially those of us with cancer, which so many equate with hair loss. If you aren't bedridden and bald, you can't be unwell, right? Wrong. Sick, even real, debilitating sick, can be quiet, invisible and subtle. In coming up with a way to keep my vivacious friend busy and do an activity together, I came up with this video. Not only was it a fun activity for friends to do, it will hopefully remind those who visit a chronically ill person what to remember during their time together. No matter the illness, the best way to be supportive is to take your cue from the sick person, and don't put pressure on them ...about anything. There are many more ""what not to do"" items that we missed, and we wanted the video short, so please feel free to add your peeve in the comments, or on facebook.

926,55,6,7,2,2016,2016-02-07,"There has been conversation on twitter from women with metastatic breast cancer, upset because they believe the Federal Government's ""cancer moonshot"" ignores women with our disease. This puzzled me. When I read the bullet points of what the Feds hope to do I don't see how metastatic cancer patients cannot benefit. This Moonshot is, of course, meant to be inclusive of all cancers, but in my view, Metastatic cancer is implied all over the place, including breast. That's the problems with twitter, we couldn't explain each other's position or ideas in 140 charactors. So I will share mine here. How does the moonshot help metastatic breast cancer patients? First, you must read the goals as listed by the White House. They are laudable goals, and if I had any confidence in government, I'd be really excited. However, we have been fighting a ""war on cancer"" since Nixon's days, and the the truth is, I am not a believer in the government's ability to fix the problem of cancer (or any problem, really.) However, for purposes of explaining that their plans are intended to help metastatic patients, let's take them at face value and examine what they want to do Let's take the bullet points one by one: Prevention and Cancer Vaccine Development. The complaint is about the word ""prevention."" I don't have a problem with working to prevent cancer but it is true, working on prevention is unlikely to help a metastatic breast cancer patient. However, there is nothing wrong with prevention as a goal, as long as it's not the only goal. Fortunately, it isn't. Remember, bullet point one doesn't only say Prevention, it also says Vaccine Development. which has already proven to be of benefit to metastatic patients. Vaccines for cancer are in its infancy, but there have already been vaccines that have been developed to help metastatic people and those with the worst, most aggressive cancers. There have been small studies that show vaccines have helped people with deadly brain tumors, two conducted by Duke University. One studied tetanus, one studied a re-engineered polio vaccine in patients with glioblastoma with excellent results. (That one was shown on 60 minutes, and passed around the cancer community). Vaccines are not for prevention only. There are several types of vaccines being looked at to help the most advanced forms of cancer. Tumor cell vaccines are made from actual cancer cells that have been removed from the patient during surgery (metastatic as well) and are being studied in breast cancer (as well as glioblastoma, prostate cancer and others.) One is in trial now for breast cancer patients who are stage four, called NeuVax, for HER2+ women. GVAX, a therapeutic vaccine made from breast cancer cell lines irradiated and engineered to express the immune molecule GM-CSF, is being tested in a phase II trial in patients with stage 4 breast cancer that does not overexpress HER2. There are more being studied for metastatic people. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say Early Cancer Detection I agree that putting money into early cancer detection will not help a metastatic cancer patient. Since we do not yet know what causes mets, early detection doesn't seem to be the answer to stopping it. Most of us with metastatic breast cancer, indeed, were caught early stage. But if, in the early detection science, we learn how cancer metastasizes, that could be of value. If they are only going to focus on finding cancer (mammograms) rather than understanding it, this section will be a waste. But we must remember that the moonshot is not only for breast cancer, and some types of cancer are quite difficult to find at an early stage, such as Ovarian. Finding ovarian cancer early does seem to lead to much easier treatments and a potential cure. Liquid biopsies fit under this umbrella, and they may truly find cancer early enough to lead to a cure. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Cancer Immunotherapy and Combination Therapy: Immunotherapy is what has kept me alive. I would have been dead two years ago without it. Immunotherapy is Herceptin, Perjeta, TDM-1 (Kadcyla), all of which have helped me as a metastatic cancer patient. CDX-011 is being studied for triple negative cancer. There is immunotherapy for many cancers - Rutuxan for Leukemia and Lymphoma. And breakthroughs move to different cancers: Herceptin has used in stomach and lung cancers, and who knows how more it may help? We must have many more therapies that help a patient's own immune system to fight cancer. More targeted therapies too, like Gleevac. Most metsters are on combination therapy - herceptin/perjeta, or ibrance and faslodex. Studying which combos can be more effective can only help metsters. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say Genomic Analysis of Tumor and Surrounding Cells. This is critical for understanding cancer and especially metastasis. Once we do gene sequencing and can analyze and compare genetic mutations, we can find out which cancers will spread, which may never spread, maybe stop them from spreading, stop them from spreading more. The possibilities are endless. We may learn the deep mysteries of cancer by focusing on genomic analysis which is critical for not only metsters, but every single person with cancer. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Enhanced Data Sharing, As I shared recently, Big Data, along with genomic sequencing, is going to be the answer to cancer. Every cancer may be like a snowflake, with mine different than others with HER2+. Why have I responded to Perjecta and Kadcyla so well, and others haven't? If we could sequence my genes, and the genes of others like me, and not like me, and find that one difference that helps me respond, we learn something incredibly important. We could unlock the the mechanism of metastasis with a searchable database of cancer mutations. And if genius cancer researcher Dr. X at Duke has an idea, and genius biologist like Dr. Y at Caltech have an idea, and a genius geneticist Dr. Z at MIT have an idea, and they can access this database and see something from their own unique perspective, perhaps they can come up with new and better treatments, or a cure for all stages of cancer. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Oncology Center of Excellence. Okay, this is just another government agency which will likely come up with a lot of bureaucratic junk that slows everything down. Sorry, but that's what happens. Unless they let doctors and researchers do their thing, which is unlikely. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Pediatric Cancer They plan to spend more on pediatric cancers, which I am not complaining about. And they will be studying metastatic pediatric patients certainly. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say: Vice President’s Exceptional Opportunities in Cancer Research Fund: They say, ""To launch the National Cancer Moonshot, scientists, cancer physicians, advocates, philanthropic organizations, and representatives of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry will need to work together to focus on major new innovations in the understanding of and treatment for cancer."" Sounds nice but once again, too many cooks in the kitchen, too many people with competing interests. This could be a disaster. My personal opinion is only cancer researchers, scientists, physicians and biotech should work on this. Start adding advocates and philanthropic organizations and it starts to get balkanized and you start to get people worried about their own cancer and their own interests. And, you get people who read this and don't see ""metastatic breast cancer"" mentioned and because of the lack of three little words start being unable to see the forest for the trees. Give scientists money and let them do their thing. However, they go on to say: ""The work that the Vice President will be undertaking will ensure just that – bringing together all parties, breaking down silos, and sharing data to generate new ideas and new breakthroughs."" They are so right. The silos of each individual cancer/philanthopy organization/research institution has always problematic. When we don't work together, when we don't see commonalities, we can't solve the problem. If we can truly break down silos and share information about CANCER, in general, find out what is similar and what is different in every way it appears - we can make huge progress. Will this help metastatic cancer patients? I say In this world of cancer, we advocates also need to break down the silos of our own particular disease state and start realizing a win for one is a win for all. The word ""metastatic"" doesn't have to be there if the entire design of the program will help benefit metastatic patients, breast as well as others. Let's not miss the big picture. If this works as envisioned, we could solve cancer in my lifetime, the way we have basically solved AIDS. But we must see the big picture and support scientists and the ultimate goal of this moonshot instead of attacking it for minor things Unfortunately, since the 1960s, our country doesn't have a very good track record of letting things like this unfold the way they were designed, and every advocate is going to get in there and want a piece of it, and special treatment for their own disease. They will tear it down so much it's just another government agency that does nothing. Not that I'm cynical or anything.",0,1,0.13505650745146547

And, of course, ""Pathological Complete Response."" I have been lucky enough to hear two out of three of those phrases. After being in remission for a year, my PET scan of October showed ""moderately extensive metastatic disease."" Cancer was spreading all through my abdomen and spots were appearing in my lungs. I was resigned, because this is the way cancer goes, but damn. I just bought a car, I have a teenager who has a couple years left of college and my older son is getting married. My stepdaughter has the most beautiful child on earth and I am not done admiring him. I didn't think I was about to drop dead, but I was worried I could be on my last year of life. I pictured 2016 on my headstone. I had intense pain (which is how it got diagnosed) and couldn't eat. Living in the world of cancer advocacy, I know way too many women who heard about a spread and died a few weeks later; this disease can move fast. I feared the next woman mourned online could be me. October Scan After discovering this new spread, my doctor put me on TDM1, aka Kadcyla. After 4 infusions, we wanted to see how it was doing. Since my pain had dropped from an 8 to a 4, I was hopeful. I had a scan yesterday, and today, I heard those sweet, sweet words. I have a complete response to this chemo. Nothing that looks like cancer to a scanning machine is left in my body. Even the tiny spots in the lungs are gone. I have heard NED twice now. I am incredibly lucky. Many women with metastatic cancer do not get this kind of news - ever. I know a few who had a couple spots of bone mets that were stopped early and never progressed even years later, but most, like me, do chemo after chemo after chemo, cancer growing and retreating, until nothing works and then it's hospice time. Very few get to hear NED twice, at least, in my (admittedly limited) experience. I have an amazing medical team - a fantastic doctor. I can't say enough good things about everybody there. But so do others, there are many good doctors and caring nurses - for some reason, my body responds well to drugs that act on HER2. We need more of these drugs, and more for other cancers. I typically don't ask prognosis questions but I couldn't help squeaking out, ""How long do you think it will last?"" My doctor just looked at me quizzically, and I remembered, he doesn't have his crystal ball. I've been around this block, it could come back in 2 months or stay gone for years. That's why I normally don't ask. I smiled and said, ""Never mind."" I'll take it as it comes. That is what we with mets earn to do, and it is not a lesson that can be lost. Go ahead, knock me down. I dare you! In a way, as great as this news is, I feel like one of those punch ball ""bop"" dolls. Remember when you were a kid and had one? At first, you could punch and kick the shit out of them and they kept rising defiantly. Eventually, you'd punched them so much the air dissipated and they would lie tiredly on the floor for a second before they came up slowly - but they still rose; weaker but with determination. After some time, wrinkles appeared and half their body would remain flopped over, but the other half? It still arose. It was down but not totally out. Eventually, you'd put them in your toybox and close the lid. Emotionally, I am realizing - holy crap, I have to spend more years in treatment, still going to doctors, getting chemo, getting scans, managing pain, not healthy enough to work but wishing to do more, and never knowing the future. Chemo every three weeks, ad infinitum. I've heard the best news possible, but cancer isn't gone. I'm in treatment forever. My life is about continuing to be beaten and rising again. And then I think HOLY CRAP!!! I GET TO SPEND MORE TIME GOING TO TREATMENT!!! HOW LUCKY CAN I BE? Go ahead cancer, kick me. I'm still popping up, and it looks like I will be for a while. So my goal (again) is to pump some more air in, in the form of food and healthy lifestyle so I can pop up with a bit more energy. I am not hitting that toybox for a while. I asked my nurse if she'd seen anybody have my response after all the treatment I'd been through, and she said no. Everybody seemed elated at my news. My nurse took a walk down memory lane, remembering how sick I'd been a couple of years ago on Gemzar. My doctor laughed, ""Now you have a good blog post."" He's right. Statistics state that 22% of women diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer live five years. Median life expectancy is 2 years. It will be 5 years for me in May; the month my oldest son marries. There are no statistics for how many live 10 years probably because few do. I don't know why I am lucky enough to get to hear this news, again, when so many wonderful, lovely people don't get to hear it even once. But if I give any woman hope: that it can be them, that metastatic breast cancer is something that some of us live with for a while, maybe a long while, that dreams can still come true and goals reached - than I will keep going and posting and putting myself out there. I will do what I can to help metastatic women, help our voices be heard. It is not an easy life; it's a life with unique challenges, but it's a beautiful one. I know I needed to see people like me back when I was diagnosed, to know it was possible to live past what you see and hear online. So here I am.

928,55,8,1,2,2016,2016-02-01,"I see I did review a couple of these..... It's like high school all over again. I am assigned People ask me to review their book and write a report review. I love to read, and pretty much always agree that this is a good idea. What is better than supporting an author? In high school I geekily ended up reading the assigned book the first night. I was such a good student, I'm not quite sure how I graduated with an only 2.0 GPA. Anyway...those thick glasses came in handy, I was a reader. But somehow *cough ADD cough* I never did the report until the night before it was due, and then I'd be all crazy, writing until my hand cramped, staying up long past my parents went to bed, so busy scribbling I didn't have time to even to dot my i's with little hearts or smiley faces. (Yes, kids, back in those days we not only had to hand-write our papers, but we also had to draw our own emoticons. It was a primitive time). Now of course, I'm a mature adult. I get the book in the mail and read it immediately. And then I put it down to take a nap, as we adults must sleep a lot. The next day is chemo. On the third day, I decide to write about it but I just need to check facebook for a second......then instagram, then twitter, I don't want anybody left out. And, of course, I haven't played Zuma in a while so maybe just a few games. Wow, I'm tired, I better take a nap. (*see, adult) By then, ADD, compounded with chemo-brain is in full force and the entire thing slips my mind. Not only can't I remember that I had something to review, when I finally remember, the entire plot of the book has slipped my mind. Naturally, I have to flip through the book to refresh my memory, but where did I leave it? It isn't in my reading room, it isn't in my bed. It isn't anywhere! Did the dogs take it? I think those damn dogs have stolen them. I have to search under their beds and look behind their bones or under their basket of stuffed toys to try to find them. Yes, the dog ate my homework. Greyhound bookmarks And then because I have cancer and something hurts, and I can't walk around the house anymore, I think ""I'll do it later"" and then chemo brain takes over again, and I forget what I was doing. Until I remember again - and I go through this process over and over. In the meantime, these poor writers are waiting for me, just as I wait to hear a comment on a post. Eventually, they give up, sadly, and go about their lives of obscurity, all because I wouldn't review their book. It's very mean of me, to be honest. I'm a terrible person. It's amazing how few of them remind me of my forgetfulness. Perhaps they are sympathetic to my illness, or since many of them had chemo themselves, have completely forgotten about me. But one sharp writer recently (and kindly) asked, ""Hey, I didn't see your review of my book, did you ever post it?"" Um. I thought I did actually. Unlike many, I remembered her because I see her on facebook. I may have posted a review on facebook as I sometimes do. But you can't really go through old stuff on facebook and look easily. However, I told her it'd be on my blog, and a search of this blog shows I never did review it here. So, I need to be honorable and do what I said, so I began the search. And this time, the dogs hadn't stolen it. But when I found her book, guess what? There was an entire stack of cancer books underneath it. At this point, with a few exceptions, I don't remember what I was asked to read and what I read on my own, what I reviewed and didn't. Considering I have a PET scan tomorrow that could give me the worst possible news, I think I better get this off my conscience, don't you? So I am going to mention them all, with the exception of a couple I know I did review, or ones I think I bought myself. They aren't going to get a full-fledged review anymore but I can assure you that each one I enjoyed and all are worth reading. I feel miserable and guilty but what can I do? I'm just a chemo-addled, ADD, crazy, lazy woman with dogs who like to read. So here goes. Renee in Cancerland by Renee Sendelbach. Renee writes the blog, Team S, Living with Stage IV Cancer and is an amazing woman. This is a touching and brave book about her life with metastatic cancer, which is in her brain. If you are looking for a grammatically perfect book, this is not for you. There are some typos and errors in grammar, as would be expected for somebody whose cancer is in the brain. (And who am I to judge?) Don't take that to mean that she has nothing to say. She goes deep into the heart of what it is like to live with a devastating illness that she knows will take her life. She writes about her love for her husband and children, her hopes and fears. There are photos of herself and family, and she shares the life lessons she's learned, along with a bit of poetry and a lot of artwork sprinkled in. (She's a talented artist.) This is raw insight into the thoughts and experiences of a metastatic cancer patient, and I recommend it. I support her fully, and taking on a book when you have gone through the treatment she has - it's pretty much incredible. Kicking Cancer to the Curb, by Carole Miele. Despite the title, Carol has been living with metastatic cancer since 2010; hers is in the bone. Carole has been an advocate for cancer patients, likely because of her nursing profession. Her book is full of advice, such as what people should say to patients with mets, and what not to say. She also describes her experience of living with metastatic disease, including things like mental and spiritual changes. She shares defining moments in her life that shaped her thinking as she faced this catastrophic disease. There are poems and quotes that are meaningful to a cancer patient. Her goal in writing the book is to impart information, support and approaches she has learned to make the experiences of others less burdensome, and she was highly successful. If you have mets you will get support and advice here. Beauty After Breast Cancer by Katelyn Carey and Joseph Linaschke. It's hard to imagine a cancer coffee table book, but this is as close to one as you will get. Katelyn is a nurse who had DCIS. When she discovered she needed a mastectomy, she realized there were no realistic photos showing what she might look like. She's right, it is a complaint all patients have - we want to SEE what we may look like, and yet there is nothing available. Sure, plastic surgeons may have photos, but they only show their best case scenarios, and those photos are unrelatable - it is a woman standing straight forward, her eyes obliterated if you see her face at all, and a lifeless torso from front to side - they are the mug shots of mastectomy. There is no life in those photos and so nothing that we can see that gives us knowledge or hope. So Katelyn decided to gather women who have had breast surgery and take realistic photos of women living their lives, with the hopes that book ends up in physician's offices. In this book, women will not only see what breast surgery looks like, but learn that this surgery will not end their beauty. This book is full of women with single, double, partial mastectomies, with and without reconstruction - surgeries of all type. Each tell their cancer story alongside their photos. They are not models, they are regular woman who had cancer and who overcame this body changing experience. Not only do you get reality, you get it in a way that shows beauty does not leave just because cancer invaded your life. The professional and gorgeous photos of women is full of joy, and the attitude is that they may have lost a body part, but they didn't lose what is most important. Bravery is beauty, not breasts.™ This should be in every single breast surgeon's office. I will be donating my copy, as beautiful as it is, to my own breast surgeon. I always thought I should pop in and say hi to see if he remembers me. Old-timers here will remember Rockstar Raja! My Healthcare is Killing me! by Julie Klein. I thought this book was hilarious, and I really liked it - but to me, it didn't have much to do with the description. She said she had to confront indifferent and insensitive doctors, bureaucratic policies that prevented her from getting timely care and was in a healthcare maze. I expected her to not get treatment and have to deal with cruel physicians and be on the phone all the time fighting, and it didn't seem that she had a more difficult time than most of us have, in fact, it was - easier in many ways. As I read it though, I thought that she seemed to have pretty good insurance and her doctors seemed quite patient. It is interesting the different perspective we can have about the same thing, isn't it? Aside from that difference, I thought her well-written and funny descriptions of her anxiety and the problems she faced going through breast cancer were all too spot-on, and I'm jealous at how funny she actually is. Her characters are well drawn, her descriptions vivid and I found it charming. Definitely worth a read if you are newly diagnosed. Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, by Dr. Susan Love. I don't think this book needs much description - if you are reading my blog you have likely heard of Dr. Susan Love. This book is considered the ""bible"" of breast health. She came out with an update so that is what I have read. My complaint with this version is the same as my complaint with the last - there isn't much about metastatic cancer. It takes 509 pages before we get a chapter about mets (which ends 60 pages later) and that chapter is not only about mets, but includes regional relapse too. If memory serves, this is more space than last version, but still not very detailed. No matter, this is the comprehensive book explaining pretty much every aspect of breasts and breast cancer. This is the first book I think anybody diagnosed with cancer should get. There are checklists, definitions, and basic information about breast cancer that everybody should know. Don't let the size put you off, you don't have to read it cover to cover, just find the parts of interest. You will handle your cancer much better if you have this as a reference. You should know what the details mean. When Cancer Hits Home by Patrick Maguire, MD Not specifically about breast cancer, Dr. Maguire takes the most common cancers and gives an overview of each. He starts with a patient story, then describes Risks and Causes, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnosis, Staging, and Treatment. He seems to think that risk for cancers can be reduced by outside methods, something I'm not so sure about, but the descriptions and stories of each cancer will help anybody who may have cancer in their family and wants to monitor the details. Dr. Maquire has a degree in English, which means this is a well-written book. A good, general reference for cancer. Bald is Better with Earrings, by Andrea Hutton This is subtitled ""a Survivor's Guide to Getting Through Breast Cancer"" and it is chock full of tips for managing the symptoms that come with chemo, radiation and a mastectomy. There are tips on managing your port, your nails and your poor hair. It is an amusing and insightful how-to guide for getting through early-stage cancer treatment, one I highly recommend it. Death, by Todd May Confession: this one is written by my cousin, who is a professor of Philosophy at Clemson University. I have only met him once in my life and we haven't spoken in 40 years and he has no idea that I am sick so this is not pushing a family book. I wasn't asked to review it - I was given this book by my uncle and found that it was fascinating. He writes from the perspective of an atheist (guess it runs in the family) but does not diminish the role of religion in facing death. He writes about what it is like to be human beings who understand our mortality and know what it means and to go on living in spite of knowing our end. While it certainly reads like a professor wrote it, he brings up fascinating questions about the role death plays in our lives and our society. Pilates for Breast Cancer Survivors, by Naomi Aaronson and Ann Marie Turo. I must have said yes to this book when I was in remission and thought I could get healthy again. Since the book hadn't been opened, I likely got the news of my relapse around the time it arrived. I confess, I didn't read it in depth but I don't think it's necessary. We all know Pilates is good for you, and this book has exercises for breast cancer patients with modifications for the injuries we sustain, and even the surgeries we have (such as DIEP or TRAM). They also understand lymphedema and work around that. Despite the fact that I didn't read it or go through it in detail, I VERY MUCH recommend it. I had a terrible time after my mastectomy, and had I exercised or had a program like this, I might not be living with the shoulder pain that I have today, 6 years after that surgery. Everybody who has breast surgery MUST do an exercise program. Period. A Cancer Companion, by Ranjana Srivastava, MD Written by an oncologist, there is practical advice on what to expect after diagnosis, (including how to find an oncologist), what to expect before and after treatments both physically and emotionally. While she doesn't focus on any particular type of cancer, she does describes the basics that are the same for everybody: what hearing ""you have cancer"" can do to you, what an oncologist should say, what to expect during chemo, how appetite may be affected - even what to say to your kids. The book is written in a accessible, conversational way. It is definitely a good book - and advice from an oncologist is always good to have, don't you think? I hope I didn't leave any off. From now on, if I do a book review, I'll post it on facebook as it is a place I find quick and easy to do and then I won't get so far behind. My final recommendation is one that I just read on my own, called: When Breath Becomes Air by by Paul Kalanith This book is in an entirely different category. It is an unbelievably beautiful book, with gorgeous prose, written by a physician who died of cancer. Paul captured the thoughts and feelings that those of us experience in such a truthful, graceful, unsparing way that it left me in tears. We may be able to understand and accept that we are going to die but we still feel the ineffable sadness at the loss of our future and frankly, at the knowledge of our obliteration, and Paul worked through this struggle and shared it with us. It's a jewel of a book, this reflection on mortality. It will make you gasp with the beauty of his words and weep at the losses that cut so deep. We all die, and as a neurosurgeon Paul knew that better than most. Coming to grips with it at a young age is a struggle, as I well know. In the end, we look through our lives to see what our legacy will be. He left behind two beautiful things: his daughter and this book. I believe it will be read for years to come and become the definitive book on human mortality. It's simply beautiful. I cannot recommend it enough but buy tissues for when you read it and you are warned - it is a hard read for those of us who are also in his shoes. I really wish I could add, ""Breast Cancer? But Doctor, I Hate Pink"" to this list but the publisher/editor I had was not working out. She was a small, one person publisher, and I suspect that she didn't really have time to turn this blog into a book and after many months, still had not worked on it, giving me excuse after excuse. So if you are a publisher who does want to publish my blog....give me a heads-up. (I do not have the time or energy to self-publish, and I admire the women above who have!)",0,1,0.1506890193740844
929,55,9,28,1,2016,2016-01-28,"""When it comes to cancer, time matters."" C. Anthony Blau It's my belief that we are at the very start of cancer research. If you think about how much more we know than we did 50 years ago, sure, we have made great strides; some cancers that were formerly incurable now have treatments that allow people to live a normal lifespan. CML is one great example. But those breakthroughs are few and far between, and for people like me, who have languished for four years with metastatic disease, basically waiting to die - it is not enough. Other areas of our life are unrecognizable from before. 60 years ago, there were no computers, no internet, no cell phones, no satellite TV. Look what we have now. Yet, the way cancer research is conducted, despite the new tools, is not that much different than it used to be. That can and should be fixed, and I am writing about somebody who wants to be at the forefront. I have written a lot about the problem with the philanthropic end of breast cancer, and it is common knowledge that I believe that many charities don't give enough money to metastatic research. But I don't often write about the problems with research itself. I did talk about it when I was at SXSW 2015, and I have eagerly watched the process of ASCO's CancerLinQ. I became concerned about that idea though, when ASCO started putting value on cancer patient's lives. I truly feel they should be expenditure-neutral. Aside from them, I see nobody else trying to put patient data into the cloud to learn from it, and it has saddened that medical research seem to be stuck in a time warp. Wait, you haven't been following this? What do I mean? Who is doing research? Well, the research that will eventually turn into a treatment for you is done by very smart people in labs at cancer institutions, medical schools, government labs and pharmaceutical companies. They don't work together, just as individual businesses don't work together. They are each answering to their own stakeholder. Yes, I believe they all want to solve this terrible problem; these are human beings who have had mothers and sisters and fathers with cancer. I believe in altruism and I know a lot of people go into this field to solve the cancer mystery. But rules are rules. The way it works now, research may be repeated across the world. Grants are only funded if they fit existing theories about how cancer works - that means the genius who has a brilliant out-of-the-mainstream idea has little recourse in getting that idea heard. Any difference in cellular or genetic properties could be the breakthrough we need and could be turned into a treatment, but each individual only works in their own little area and cannot step out. A research doctor asking for a grant proposal knows that only 20% of ALL ideas are even funded and approvals require small, next level thinking - not the leaps we need. Steps are slow and incremental. Even when something has made the cut, going through the long process, getting it to the clinic - to you, the patient, is very slow. Imagination is no longer a valued commodity when it comes to research. Yes, safety is important but for those of us who are terminal, we might be willing to throw some safety out the door for an improved chance at life. In this era of Big Data, it no longer has to be this way. Big Data has the power to put information at every single researcher's fingertips, and enable the magical discovery that may advance the understanding of cancer. I'm not alone in thinking this way. Please watch this amazing video from Dr. C. Anthony Blau, Professor of Hematology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His area of interest is metastatic triple negative breast cancer. This video is ten minutes long and I really think you should take the time to watch, as he can explain to you much more than I can, in a better way. You will stand up and cheer at the end, I promise. I had the honor of speaking to him. He has developed a web-based tool called the Tumor Crowd Modeling Platform, This is designed to so that cancer patients can upload their molecular and lab data for comments by experts around the world. If you have had your tumor sequenced, you can uupload it to the cloud, and specialists, cancer researchers and experts from any discipline across the world can look through the data. Maybe somebody may see connections that cause a spark, and who knows? Maybe come up with the next Geevac or Herceptin. Or, maybe they'll find something that they they can recommend to just one you. That, in fact, has already happened. Dr. Blau told me that nobody has ever said no in answering a question about a mutation that was found that seemed different, no matter what institution they work for, what papers were published or about to be. Researchers get back to their roots and want to help. Dr. Blau asked me if I thought this was something cancer patients would be interested in, and my answer? Hell yes. There are some very difficult issues he has to surmount. Money. Finding people with the ability to get their tumor sequenced and have it uploaded. Money. The fear of patient identification. (Not my fear). Money. But this is the type of thinking that in 2016 we need. If I am wrong, you can post below. If I am right, you can post below.

930,59,1,20,4,2016,2016-04-20,"At a recent conference, Dr Piccart-Gebhart asked the question of how the highly fragmented breast cancer research is meeting patient's needs. This raises a very good point. We know there is all sorts of medical research going on right now. It covers many different areas in gene expression, tumor micro environment and more, and for each type of breast cancer that exists. But does it answer these questions, as noted in the articlets? ""Patients with advanced-stage HER2-positive breast cancer tend to want answers to the following questions: Can I live for many more years with the disease? Can I be sure that the chosen therapy will truly help me? Can I stay away from therapies with marked side effects for long periods of time?..."" ""Patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer have a different perspective when it comes to tailoring their treatment. What they want to know is: Can I be sure that my long-term treatment will help me? Can I do as well with a simpler or a shorter treatment? Can I forgo aggressive chemotherapy?"" I know these questions were posed as for HER2+ patients but I think they are applicable for all early and late stage cancer patients. As a cancer patient, I hear about new research all the time but very rarely am I able to 'connect the dots' and figure out what it would really mean for me if available when I was diagnosed. The article I mention above had an doctor and consultant to Roche-Genentech answering the questions for HER2+ patients. I am not a doctor. Usually when I ask my doctors about a new advancement that sounds like it might work for me, I am told that yes its new but needs more research before they can be sure... Well how can I tell? I don't have the training to understand all this medical stuff. It would be nice if research was presented in a way us patients could understand and how it ties into other research and what it means for the patient.

A nice spring Saturday is the perfect day to contemplate the garden and take care of other things around the house. We started by cleaning out the garage of gardening items and moving them under the porch. I pointed, my husband picked things up and put them down. He then set up the hammock stand so I had to try it out for a bit. (Very comfortable. I will make good use of it this summer.) I then went into the garden and cleaned out some invasive weeds (I swear the previous owners considered dandelions to be good plants). Then I pruned away at the dead branches on the bushes and the ones which were broken in the heavy snow this winter. So far so good. I probably spent an hour in the garden. Later I set up my loom and warped it (put the longer strands of yarn on it) so I could begin weaving. I was about to start weaving when I realized that my back hurt a lot and was starting to spasm. At that point, I decided I was done for the day and my husband cooked dinner while I lay in bed. I thought I was okay with a pain pill and went to bed. I did not sleep well (second night in a row) and my back is still pretty sore. I am waiting for my next pain pill to kick in. But I was only trying to be normal and do normal things. And today is not going to be a good day. Too bad I have plans for lunch out and then a museum. I will start with lunch and see how well I actually do. I probably will have to nix the museum as I am not sure how I will do standing so much. Grrrr.... I just wanted to have a normal day. Is that too much to ask?",0,1,0.09922222222222221

I have enough going on in my life that I can be a bit cranky when dealing with others. As a friend was telling me recently, I need to keep my mouth shut and not tell people they are driving me crazy. I know its not my business what someone else wants to do but sometimes I can be a bit 'outspoken' (as I hear peals of laughter in my head from the people who know me best). I recognize that I do think I can come across as a bit bitchy at times. I do try to be a nice person but sometimes I just can't keep my mouth shut. Especially if someone is really pushing my buttons, then I get really cranky. Here's an example: a group of friends are trying to get together for lunch and a museum. Around here, many public libraries have discount museum passes available on a first come/first served basis. I don't mind getting the museum passes, because I am cheap and it saves me money. But one friend (and I am not making this up) called me, texted me, called my library, and texted me again in a five minute period to let me know that my library has the pass available for the day we want them, they were available, and could I reserve it. I didn't require babysitting and I sent her a text back to tell her that. That all got under my skin for some reason. Why did she need to do so much? All I needed was to be asked to see if I could get the museum pass. Am I over-reacting? I don't think so. It made me feel that she thought I was incapable of checking on the availability of the pass and reserving it. Of course my inner child made me wait several days to actually reserve the pass to make her sweat if she decided to micromanage me and check again at the library. I don't need micromanaging. I am quite capable of taking care of things myself. Allow me to feel a bit intolerant for a bit here.",0,1,0.06980042016806724
933,59,12,8,4,2016,2016-04-08,"Do you ever wonder if you are focusing too much on the cancer in your life? Or too little? Before a cancer diagnosis, cancer probably occupies a little tiny corner of your brain. After a cancer diagnosis, it takes up all but the little tiny corner of your brain required to do basic things like eat and sleep at minimal levels. After the initial stress, cancer-brain occupation slowly settles down to a somewhat manageable level as basic human demands for survival kick in - like thinking semi-logically. Eventually you get to a bit more of an even keel so you get through life, after therapy, support groups, or whatever. Then life goes on, if cancer doesn't return, and you get some more of your brain capacity back and begin to think about life around you again. So now, I wonder if I am thinking too little about cancer? Because I do not allow it to fill my brain all the time. Should I allow myself to think about cancer more? Now that I have this knitting group with other women with cancer at the cancer support center, I feel like I am back in a support group sometimes. We have conversations about the ups and downs of diagnosis and treatment along with all sorts of related issues. I kind of like that part. But it makes me wonder if I should be thinking (pondering) cancer more? I like being sort of back to my regular life without the cancer domination.

(Those were the evil cells.) Now there is a new theory, that a group of cancer cells located together then grow into a tumor (known as a metastasis which none of us want). I can relate to this new theory. A single cell isn't a bad guy. Its when the rest of them are bad, they have nothing to do but hang out together and spread their evilness around your body. Like hanging out in a bad neighborhood. I had never really thought about what the environment of a tumor cell would have to do with the growth of cancer until I had Dr Susan Love talk back about five or so years ago. She had discussed that new research then was interested in the neighborhood a bad cancer cell was in, not just the cell itself. This new research seems to show that train of thinking has been subject to research and now is showing more answers. So now I must have a stern talking to with any cancer cells that may be hanging out in my body and tell them to stay away from each other. I am sure that will prevent any recurrence.....",0,-1,-0.09785025580480124

Nurses and doctors tell you things like ""there may be some discomfort"", or the ever popular ""little pinch"". Maybe you might feel ""tired afterwards"" or ""possibly nauseous"", or ""a little pain"" at the site that can be handled by ""OTC acetaminophen or ibuprofen"". But you really need prescription morphine for the pain, cant get out of bed for three days because of fatigue, or spend days running for the bathroom. They never can tell you more, like the real truth. Bounded by HIPAA concerns or the simple fact that they have never experienced it themselves. Face it most of our medical professionals have never experienced the procedures they perform on patients. Sure they have had blood tests, injections, and more, but have they had your chemo protocol, surgery, or invasive procedure? Probably not. Hence there is no way for them to tell you how you will feel before, during, and after, other than scared sh**less, because they really do not know. I hate this. I have learned to research all medical procedures before I have them. I also look to friends and others who might have experienced it to find out what its like from the patient's perspective. (I am so 'healthy' my father, in his late 80s, asks if I have had any new procedure recommended for him.) I do not obsess about it but I do want a good idea of what something will be like.

The changing levels were mostly due to my health. It used to be pretty good but did have its ups and downs. But I did used to be pretty healthy with cancer staying fairly far into the back of my brain. I was mostly on an even keel. I say 'mostly' because who can say they are continually positive all the time. After a quarter century of a cancer focus in my life when went from all encompassing to moving to the back of my brain, things changed. Nearly nine years ago, that all changed when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Cancer came front and center in my life. Actually it came roaring back into the front and center of my life. One thing else I did know at the time was that I had already gotten through cancer once before so I could be slightly optimistic that I could do it again. A tiny sliver of positive things. But for the next six years probably it was still important to me and a topic of frequent blog posts. But then in 2013 when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, cancer has slipped in importance in my life, but still lingers.... After two cancers, its never going to go away. Now I have a split focus in my life, sort of evenly divided between: breast cancer thyroid cancer rheumatoid arthritis fibromyalgia all the related side effects from all the related treatments What this means is that cancer is not completely a giant sucking black hole in my life. This is a slightly 'healthier' balance. Not that I am healthy but maybe a saner balance. I think anyone when they are diagnosed with cancer, it takes over their life, until something changes in their life and they get distracted.

Apparently back in 2010 some people decided they were tired of scientists setting the research agenda time line so they decided to create their own deadline. How illogical... how over simplified. Through my blog reading, I read the latest updates from other bloggers. One of them, Jennie, went to the recent Deadline 2020 people's meeting, which the metastatic breast cancer community calls, Deadby2020, at a high end resort in Napa Valley.

(Read Jennie's blog post to get all the details.) Perhaps there should be an investigation into misuse of funds here as well. One problem is the Deadby2020 people ignore metastatic breast cancer and only focus on prevention, and women, and white women only (if their meeting is anything to go by). This leaves more than 40,000 people dying each year from the disease. And Jennie acted in the normal fashion of the metastatic breast cancer community and started live tweeting from the meeting. And was cornered and told to stop. This was after she was cornered and told to stop bringing up metastatic breast cancer. I can't believe how rude they were to her. How selective they were to her. How unconcerned they were about her feelings and sensitivities. I have run many events myself and can understand how one person with questions can appear to alter the focus of a meeting. But if they are too narrowly focused they are not benefiting anyone. It would have been better if they had stopped their agenda and added a session on metastatic breast cancer and what can be done about it. Also the concept of holding such an event which does not accurately represent the people they are trying to help while excessively spending (rooms start at $540/night), in my opinion, is basically unethical and irresponsible.What were they thinking?

Research takes time and is not going to be ready for the evening news, until it is complete. This holds true for all types of research. Time is a requirement of research.

""An international panel of pathologists and clinicians has reclassified a type of thyroid cancer to reflect that it is noninvasive and has a low risk for recurrence. The panel renamed encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP)."" So you used to have cancer but now you don't any more. This isn't a cure in any way, shape, or form. Its a bit of fancy word play if you ask me. And its a way to prevent overdiagnosis. (Isn't that smart.) Its sort of like sending a rocket to Pluto and then deciding not to after it was already on its way. For me its a bit of a different story. Back at my thyroid cancer diagnosis, I was told I had both follicular and papillary. I don't think they had any way of diagnosing subtypes then so I have no way of knowing if the follicular thyroid cancer I had was this non-cancer type or not. This is not helpful to me at all. ""Dr Nikiforov and colleagues point out that the incidence of EFVPTC has risen two- to threefold during the past 20 to 30 years and makes up 10% to 20% of all thyroid tumors diagnosed in Europe and North America. This increased incidence has been explained by improvements in diagnosis. It has been described as an ""epidemic of diagnosis"" rather than a true increase in disease."" This is part of the movement to decrease over diagnosis and over treatment. Okay, I can understand the over treatment part but not the over diagnosis part. ""In 2013, a working group sanctioned by the National Cancer Institute proposed that a number of premalignant conditions, including ductal carcinoma in situ and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, should no longer be called ""cancer."" Instead, the conditions should be labeled something more appropriate, such as indolent lesions of epithelial origin (IDLE), the working group suggested. ""Use of the term 'cancer' should be reserved for describing lesions with a reasonable likelihood of lethal progression if left untreated,"" the group said at the time."" Over diagnosis is a problem that I can agree with. However if its an ailment that requires treatment it should be treated appropriately. I also can agree if people are told what they have is not cancer, it may be significantly less stressful for the patient and their family. But if it is something that could turn in to cancer and kill you in the long run, the word cancer should not be removed from the name.

He kept saying that what he does to make himself feel better will work for everyone else, especially for the person we were talking about. I chose to disagree and we ended up arguing discussing it way too long. My point was that with rheumatoid you may be able to go do something for a bit and then you need to take a break and rest for a while before doing something else. And sometimes that rest period could be a few hours before you were up to anything else. His point was that if you were sitting for a few hours, reading or whatever, you need to get up every hour and do some exercises. And you need to go for a walk or two every day and you should never just sit around. I tried to explain that with lots of pain or different types of pain, rest may need to take priority and getting up and doing exercises every hour may not be a reality. I agree that sitting around all the time is not a good idea but sometimes when the pain is too bad, that may be all you can do. He would not let go. He insisted he was right because it works for him and that he has pain too (but not rheumatoid) and he is just stubborn as hell. He assumed because he has pain too what works for him works for everyone else with pain. I ended up being very upset and made some excuse to get off the phone. He assumed the wrong thing. That pain is pain and it is no different for one to another. But it is. I find this so aggravating.

(Those were the evil cells.) Now there is a new theory, that a group of cancer cells located together then grow into a tumor (known as a metastasis which none of us want). I can relate to this new theory. A single cell isn't a bad guy. Its when the rest of them are bad, they have nothing to do but hang out together and spread their evilness around your body. Like hanging out in a bad neighborhood. I had never really thought about what the environment of a tumor cell would have to do with the growth of cancer until I had Dr Susan Love talk back about five or so years ago. She had discussed that new research then was interested in the neighborhood a bad cancer cell was in, not just the cell itself. This new research seems to show that train of thinking has been subject to research and now is showing more answers. So now I must have a stern talking to with any cancer cells that may be hanging out in my body and tell them to stay away from each other.

Nurses and doctors tell you things like ""there may be some discomfort"", or the ever popular ""little pinch"". Maybe you might feel ""tired afterwards"" or ""possibly nauseous"", or ""a little pain"" at the site that can be handled by ""OTC acetaminophen or ibuprofen"". But you really need prescription morphine for the pain, cant get out of bed for three days because of fatigue, or spend days running for the bathroom. They never can tell you more, like the real truth. Bounded by HIPAA concerns or the simple fact that they have never experienced it themselves. Face it most of our medical professionals have never experienced the procedures they perform on patients. Sure they have had blood tests, injections, and more, but have they had your chemo protocol, surgery, or invasive procedure? Probably not. Hence there is no way for them to tell you how you will feel before, during, and after, other than scared sh**less, because they really do not know. I hate this. I have learned to research all medical procedures before I have them. I also look to friends and others who might have experienced it to find out what its like from the patient's perspective. (I am so 'healthy' my father, in his late 80s, asks if I have had any new procedure recommended for him.) I do not obsess about it but I do want a good idea of what something will be like.

Apparently back in 2010 some people decided they were tired of scientists setting the research agenda time line so they decided to create their own deadline. How illogical... how over simplified. Through my blog reading, I read the latest updates from other bloggers. One of them, Jennie, went to the recent Deadline 2020 people's meeting, which the metastatic breast cancer community calls, Deadby2020, at a high end resort in Napa Valley. I am flabbergasted that they can send a bunch of white healthy people to an expensive resort (that could be held in a Holiday Inn conference room in a cheaper area of the country) to discuss a topic while leaving out important portions of it. (Read Jennie's blog post to get all the details.) Perhaps there should be an investigation into misuse of funds here as well. One problem is the Deadby2020 people ignore metastatic breast cancer and only focus on prevention, and women, and white women only (if their meeting is anything to go by). This leaves more than 40,000 people dying each year from the disease. And Jennie acted in the normal fashion of the metastatic breast cancer community and started live tweeting from the meeting. And was cornered and told to stop. This was after she was cornered and told to stop bringing up metastatic breast cancer. I can't believe how rude they were to her. How selective they were to her. How unconcerned they were about her feelings and sensitivities. I have run many events myself and can understand how one person with questions can appear to alter the focus of a meeting. But if they are too narrowly focused they are not benefiting anyone. It would have been better if they had stopped their agenda and added a session on metastatic breast cancer and what can be done about it. Also the concept of holding such an event which does not accurately represent the people they are trying to help while excessively spending (rooms start at $540/night), in my opinion, is basically unethical and irresponsible.What were they thinking?

And you need to go for a walk or two every day and you should never just sit around. I tried to explain that with lots of pain or different types of pain, rest may need to take priority and getting up and doing exercises every hour may not be a reality. I agree that sitting around all the time is not a good idea but sometimes when the pain is too bad, that may be all you can do. He would not let go. He insisted he was right because it works for him and that he has pain too (but not rheumatoid) and he is just stubborn as hell. He assumed because he has pain too what works for him works for everyone else with pain. I ended up being very upset and made some excuse to get off the phone. He assumed the wrong thing. That pain is pain and it is no different for one to another. But it is. I find this so aggravating. Please, if you have learned anything from your own medical issues, do not assume what worked for you will work for everyone else.",0,1,0.00223214285714287

I have: forgotten to get refills on time forgotten where I put my refills forgotten to call in refills I have even forgotten my husband's (only) prescription and had to pay out of pocket because I didn't get the preapproval done. This is turning into a real problem. I have been having a problem for months with increased pain in my hands and feet. Now my back has been more of a problem as well. It turns out I completely forgot to get my prescription anti-inflammatory refilled. No wonder I have been having more pain. In our old house, I had a system. I kept all the prescription bottles on the top shelf of the closet closest to my side of our bed. Every week I sit down and refill our pill boxes. I put all the bottles in two rows on the bed, prescriptions in one row and OTC (mostly vitamins) in the other row. Then I fill my husband's pill box with his prescription, move on to the OTC we both take, and close his box and put it aside. Then I go back to my pill box, adding all my prescriptions and then the rest of the OTC items. If I empty a bottle or nearly empty a bottle, I put them aside until I am done and then I get a refill or replacement as needed so by the next week we have all the pills we need and we never run out. At our new house, first we were very disorganized and there is no closet near my side of the bed. I kept all the prescription bottles in big zip lock bags on the floor in the corner. After a few weeks, I found a little book case, which doesn't hold books, to hold all my bottles. I keep everything there. Then one day a week, I put all the pill bottles on the bed, prescriptions in one row and OTC in another. I sit down and fill all the boxes as before. Sounds good? Well for some reason, I keep screwing up. I don't know if its because of more RA problems with my hands or that I am not focusing or something, but each week I find as I go through the week, that my pills are messed up. Sometimes I am missing one in a box, or have an extra in another. Or I find that I have missed a pill all week. This morning I realized that perhaps one reason why my hands haven't been very good is that I have not been taking my prescription anti-inflammatory pills. I don't even have a bottle for them. I checked online and found that I haven't refilled it since late January which makes sense why I am out now. But I have no idea when I last took it. Anyway, I sent in a request for a refill and will pick it up later today. However, the real problem is that I need to fix my system so I stop screwing up.

Once you get cancer, you spend the rest of your life wondering at some level 'will it come back?' or 'will they catch it in time?' The biggest thing about learning to cope with a cancer diagnosis is learning to squish that evil little voice that asks 'will it come back?' when ever you aren't expecting. Sometimes I feel I need a little punching bag or something that I can smash with a baseball bat and beat the crap out of when I feel the need. [Actually I think all post cancer treatment packs should come with a stress relieving punching bag or something. Complete with a personalized baseball bat or punching bag. Something we could beat the crap out of just to calm our nerves. Does anyone else want one?] I am serious.

It usually grows in response to how near I am to a medical facility or personnel, especially when any kinds of tests are taking place.

""The agency plans to expedite reviews of applications for generic drugs where only one treatment is currently sold."" I like this idea. A lot. Since a generic is essentially the same (but not quite exactly) of existing patented medications, the approval process is much easier than for brand new drugs (or so I believe). The problem is the agency has a backlog of generic medication applications. So now they will see if they can speed some up. The more generics available, the better.

First you have to deal with your so called 'friends' who head for the hills at the first sign of anything yucky, especially the word 'cancer'. They are not your friends. Forget about them. Then you have friends and family who obsess about your ailment and call and email constantly for the latest worst of wisdom imparted by your medical team. They often offer their 'advice' in return saying things like 'I can't understand why your doctor hasn't given you [insert the name of the treatment given to their neighbor's dog walker's cousin's hair dresser when they had a completely different diagnosis fifteen years ago]. They also want to know every time you have the least minor issue so they can be 'informed' about how you are doing. You have no idea why they need to know so much and what they are doing with all this information but feel invaded by their constant barrage of inquiries. Again, they are not really your friend either. The people who are your friends are the ones who stop by and visit, call and just listen, and treat you like a human being, while you are trying not to lose your lunch after your latest infusion. Hang out with these people. Finally, you have the person closest to you: your spouse/partner/best friend. Too many people find themselves suddenly single after a cancer diagnosis, in particular. I know we had our ups and downs with my breast cancer diagnosis. But I can't tell you how many friends have spoken of their spouse's lack of support, or even departure. My husband has been wonderful. For the last three years, he has given me my weekly injections for Rheumatoid Arthritis, because I cannot deal with the idea of giving myself a shot. He accompanied me to most of my doctor appointments after my breast cancer diagnosis, where he was allowed to see everything other than my weight and any pelvic exams. He came with me to every chemo infusion where we played scrabble during the infusions (and he would delight in winning when the drugs kicked in and I could only form two letter words). He only stopped going with me when I insisted he couldn't keep missing work for weekly infusions. Now he will go with me to any medical appointment I request him to. Unfortunately I have friends who are forced to go to difficult appointments alone or are forced to find rides for infusions or other times when they are not in shape to drive. Their partners find excuses as to why they can't help out. Or have left them completely to cope alone with bad medical news and the accompanying job loss and reduced income.

975,59,50,14,3,2016,2016-03-14,"Life after cancer can be very different than before it. Forget all that 'new normal' crap, I'm talking about how to tell new people in your life about your cancer history. This includes dating post cancer, just making new friends, and even new employers. After a cancer diagnosis, you move to 'cancerland' and are basically stuck there for the rest of your life. As life goes on you meet new people as do non-cancer people. But the difference is when, and if, you tell them about your medical history and cancer. Let's tackle these one by one. First of all when you get a new job after cancer, you should never tell your new employer about your cancer even if you get a new diagnosis. They do not need to know. You are not legally required to tell them. If you have medical appointments, they do not need to know why. You can always say something like 'I have an issue that needs to be dealt with'. And if you need chemo or radiation again which will require frequent absences you can just say you have a medical condition that may require alterations in your schedule for a while. It is your decision if you want to share your medical issues with your employer and, if you do, it will be held against you at some point. No matter that there are anti-discrimination laws, you will be discriminated against. You will become a 'sick person' in someone's mind and will blatantly or subtly become the subject of discriminatory practices. Miss out on a promotion etc because you may not be able to grow with the position or could miss too much work because of your medical issues. So keep your mouth shut. New friends? That's different. When you feel comfortable in the relationship you can tell them about your cancer if you want. It depends on how open a person you are. And how you think they might react. Some people (because they are idiots) head for the hills at the word cancer, others will wrap you in a protective blanket and try to baby you, and others may try to drive you crazy with their attempts to make you a healthy person by following their misguided attempts to force you to alter your life to that of a grain, eating raw vegan who runs marathons (or anything you are not - I am not against vegans I am just not a vegan and don't want to, nor do I want to run a marathon). Note: none of these people are your friends. The people who are your friends will treat you the same as they did before they knew about your medical history. Dating? Same deal. I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer before my freshman and sophomore years. My father called the dean because I was late coming back after summer break because of my surgery. I told a few friends and it was somewhat a known fact while I was in school but I didn't discuss it much. But I did date and tried to be a normal college student as much as possible and didn't let my cancer distract me from normal college student activities such as parties, football games, bar hopping, cramming for exams, staying up really late, and binge watching old movies on Saturdays with a group of friends. But later on when I was out in the real world, dating was different. Should I tell that hot new guy or not? Eventually I learned that there was no reason to share my cancer history until the relationship got serious. Basically, if they were close enough to me to see the medications I took daily, realized I took more than the average human being, and asked me why I needed them, that might be a good place to start. I had roommates for years that I never told about my medical history because I just didn't consider it their business. Some boyfriends I told, some I didn't. If it was a short term relationship that wasn't going anywhere, why bother? If a relationship was getting serious, it could become shared information. But it really didn't rush to share the information. Maybe I am a fairly private person but I never have found a reason to rush to share the information, unless I was is at a cancer focused organization or something. I guess what I am saying is that there is no reason to share your medical history if you don't want to. People don't need to know the specifics unless you want them to. If you are diagnosed with cancer, it is your choice to share or not. Society has become more open about cancer than in the 1980s when I was first diagnosed, but it doesn't mean you have to tell anyone you don't want to.

976,59,51,13,3,2016,2016-03-13,"Genetic testing has been researched like mad in recent years. Breast cancer genetic testing is no different than that the rest of genetic testing. But treatment options are not right up there with the testing results. When this mother found out she had breast cancer she went for a lumpectomy to be followed by radiation and that would be it. But then she went back to her doctor to discuss radiation. More genetic testing had been done and she had inherited an alteration to a gene that is needed to repair DNA. And if radiation breaks DNA so it might be better for her to skip radiation and have a double mastectomy instead. So she talked to a professor of genetics and medicine who said that information was wrong and she should be able to go ahead as originally planned. Then a group of doctors met and couldn't reach a consensus so they left the decision up to her on what to do. I am so glad I am not in this woman's shoes. That would be a horrible decision to be forced to make. Which option would be better? Or which might lead her to a quicker death? I could not imagine the emotional stress. And this shows a real problem that I had thought might be lurking in the background of progress. I have long been nervous iffy edgy unsure about the fast pace of research in some areas and the slower pace of advancements in other areas would be gaps that would leave the patient over a barrel so to speak. Some research takes longer than others to complete for a start and some times it takes longer to get to the starting point. Perhaps we might need a bit more coordination here to lessen these gaps. But since we can't undo time, here lies the question: if research has lead us to the discovery of this new gene and how it might potentially impact a patient's tolerance of treatment, should the patient even be told about the gene? Since there is no research showing how it might or might not impact the success or risk of radiation treatment, how is a patient supposed to react? I just think its blatantly unfair for a doctor to tell a patient that you have this gene that might or might not impact your course of treatment and we have no options to give you so you have to figure it out on your own. I would start by getting a new doctor who would provide guidance and reassurance to help make the patient feel confident that she is making a good decision.",0,1,0.08196576151121604

Many people rush out and get fresh fruit and vegetables specifically for their antioxidants and benefits. ""There is no question that antioxidants, such as those in fruits and vegetables and other foods, neutralize molecules called free radicals that can damage DNA. That has led to assertions that antioxidants can prevent cancer, since DNA damage can turn normal cells into malignant ones. But studies of whether antioxidant supplements (pills, not foods) can prevent cancer have largely disappointed."" So that last sentence tells us something. A hint that maybe anti-oxidants aren't quite as good as previously thought. ""Because free radicals might also attack cancer cells, scientists are studying whether antioxidants might allow tumors to flourish. The new research, in Science Translational Medicine, found that they can. When scientists exposed lab dishes of human cancer cells (liver, breast, colon, ovarian) to the diabetes drugs sitagliptin (sold by Merck as Januvia) and saxagliptin (AstraZeneca’s Onglyza), the cells migrated more. And when nine mice with human tumors were given either of the drugs, the cells metastasized more and invaded far-flung tissue...."" Did you read that right? Yes you did! The previously thought wonderful anti-oxidants appear to help metastasize cancer! So if you have cancer, your cancer will spread faster with help from the anti-oxidants. Nice! They are off my diet for now. But the writers add that they did not cause cancer, just that they helped it spread. And this is a mouse test which means that it may not be the same for humans. And more research is needed. So I am not jumping to any conclusions here. I know its only a mouse test but these results do not make me happy.",0,1,0.23804189857761288

I can understand the desire to change a healthcare plan which is hated by some and loved by others simply because it was the first pass at a national health plan. Obviously it needs some tweaks. Some want to add to it, some want to change it, and some want to replace it. I hope none would remove it. While I understand the need or desire for change, I really hope that health insurance is not taken away from anyone who already received it under the current plan.If the ACA allowed someone to finally get health insurance, could they really take it away? Many of us sick unhealthy people previously faced the barrier of not being able to get or keep health insurance after a not so good diagnosis. I hope those days do not return. Seriously could some of the people who most need health insurance have it taken away? This is a real concern for me. I realize that one of the biggest complaints of the ACA is the mandate that all citizens have health insurance or face a penalty. I can accept that. Some people just don't want a requirement like this in their life, whether it is desire not to have the government intruding in their life or that they do not feel the need for health insurance.. That is their right. But the people who want health insurance and couldn't afford it, were rejected by their insurance company, or any other reason, should still be able to have health insurance. Health insurance should not be taken away from anyone who has it and wants to keep it. Also any one who still does not have health insurance and wants it should still have it accessible.

Eventually you start to feel better and get to that 'new normal' crap they tell you about. And then something starts to not be right with your body and you go back to the doctor and find out your oh-so-wonderful cancer treatment has left you with a side effect that might kill you on its own. I know people who this has happened to. My sister in law's sister was treated with radiation to her chest in her teens for Hodgkin's and ended up dying of breast cancer at 47. A woman at the gym, her daughter just had a very serious heart attack at the age of 53 as a result of her treatment for Hodgkin's as well.

I also need a yearly chest x-ray, which is standard procedure for those on one of my medications, to make sure I am not causing permanent damage to my lungs. As medications get stronger to treat more and more ailments, their potential side effects can be deadly.

They cure you from one disease and end up killing you from something else as a result in the long run. Does this seem right? It does not to me. I am not very happy about this. But what options do I have? There are people who say they cured themselves through some diet change, a secret potion found on an island in the South Pacific, or becoming a raw paleo vegan or something. None of those options appeal to me. I do my best to take care of me but I also try to live my life the way I want.

How is use of drugs and the culture behind the scenes of professional bike riding eventually fell apart. This lead to him being banned for life from bike riding. In one part of the article, one of his former team members stated that he had a 'cancer shield' instead of being a 'cancer survivor'. I was very intrigued by the term 'cancer shield' which lead to me thinking. (Sorry, I know I should never think too much.) So I am familiar with idea of the 'cancer card', which is from Kris Carr's Crazy Sexy Cancer.This idea allows you to get out of certain things you really do not want to do.... like lunch with your boss - you can say 'well I'm not feeling that well' and sigh. I mean god for bid you might have a relapse as a result of lunch with your boss. Or you swipe that cancer card to justify buying a funky pair of new shoes.... But if you abuse that 'cancer card', do you create a 'cancer shield'? Abusing the shield would allow you to justify bad behavior by hiding behind your cancer. Its one thing to buy those fancy shoes to celebrate ending chemo. I bought myself a fancy watch in fact. But buying a new pair of shoes every day would be irresponsible and lead to a whopping credit card bill. Was Lance Armstrong using a cancer shield to hide his bad behavior and abuse of prohibited drugs? I'm not sure.

Both my grandfather's died of cancer - one of prostate cancer and one of gall bladder cancer, in their 80s. Some of my great aunts and uncles who smoked died of cancer as well. But none were very young and they were smokers. The definition of family history of cancer is: ""You may have a strong family history if any of the following situations apply to you: More than 2 close relatives on the same side of your family have had cancer – the same side of your family means either your father’s relatives or your mother’s relatives The relatives have had the same type of cancer, or different cancers that can be caused by the same gene fault The cancers developed when the family members were young, below the age of 50 One of your relatives has had a gene fault found by genetic tests It is important to remember that cancer is most common in people over the age of 60 and is rarer in young people. So cancer in older people is less likely to be due to an inherited cancer gene."" Then along came me: first cancer at age 19 and second at age 45. How did that happen? Who knows. The one thing I have learned, through lots of therapy and support groups, is that I can't beat myself up about it. (It is important to remember in life that nothing that happened can be undone, and unless you intentionally did something, do not blame yourself. You can blame your lung cancer on your chain smoking or your skin cancer on your tanning bed addiction but otherwise skip the self blame.) But I digress. Most cancers are not from family history. Despite all the publicity about the BRCA genes, something like less than 10% of breast cancer cases are attributed to them. There is also an obscure genetic mutation called Cowden's Syndrome, which has thyroid cancer and breast cancer as symptoms. But I don't have that.

1052,66,10,13,5,2015,2015-05-13,"Television chef, Sandra Lee, has discovered she has breast cancer. It is apparently quite aggressive because her doctors have informed her she is a ""ticking time bomb"" and she will be undergoing a bilateral mastectomy this week. Ms. Lee is in her forties. She insisted on getting screened for breast cancer which is smart. She does not have a family history, but that didn't stop her. Perhaps she knew that eighty percent of breast cancers are found in people without a family history. By finding her tumor early, she has the best chance of fighting it. She will have the cancerous tissue removed, receive the therapy necessary to eradicate the remaining cells, and if all goes well, she has an over ninety percent chance of beating the disease if it has not spread to her other organs. This is all common sense. If we can find a disease early and treat it why would we ever take that for granted? It is a question for the United States Task Force, a government sanctioned group that insists that women should not have their first mammogram until after the age of 50. Where would that leave Ms. Lee? If she is a ticking time bomb now, what would become of her in a few years when she is ""allowed"" to obtain screening? In today's NY Times, Ms. Lee is said, “Without early detection on my side, I could be telling a very different story,” she said. “Or not be here to tell it at all.” The Times went on to report on the task force's two sided view: Regular mammograms for women in their 40s can be controversial. In April, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a government panel, suggested that while mammograms are most beneficial for women over 50, mammograms for women in the 40s can “reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer.” And yet, they continue the most dangerous message of all: Still the task force’s draft regulations also stated that women “undergoing regular screening mammography are at risk for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat.” This is one of the most misinformed statements of the century. There is no such thing as a breast cancer that would ""not become a threat."" How do they know which cancer cells choose to divide and duplicate and take over a woman's body and kill her? Who are they to make this decision for women? I was first diagnosed in my thirties. My original tumor was partially DCIS, meaning it was in situ, or ""non-invasive"" as the Task Force likes to call it. However, the tumor broke through the duct and became invasive, very invasive with a triple negative pathology. Where would I be now if I had waited 12 more years before my first mammogram? I would not have been here. My second breast cancer was in the lobes and rapidly spread to my lymph nodes. This was only five and half years after my first cancer. Two aggressive cancers, both under the age of the Task Force's permitted age for screening. At the No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation, we go a step further. We believe in baseline screening before the age of forty. Screening that saved my life in my thirties should be available to everyone. And women in high risk groups, particularly women of African American descent, need to be screened as early as possible because they are at the greatest risk of the finding the most aggressive forms of breast cancer while still in their thirties. Ms. Lee's long time companion is New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo. In the same NY Times article, he said, “She had always been diligent about her exams, and thank God she had been diligent about her exams,” the governor said, adding, “If she waited until she was 50, this would be a very different situation.” Mr. Cuomo, as a fellow Long Islander and breast cancer survivor, after you are done helping the lovely Ms. Lee through her ordeal, please help the women of your state and then, hopefully, the nation. Eliminate the US Task Force's guidelines any way you can. Please, look into our Before Forty Initiative to help us spread the word of the risk young women face for aggressive breast cancers. The No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation has been fighting hard for a long time. We could use your help. Ms. Lee, we are here for you. We can help you through each step of your journey.

We are so very fortunate to have Constantine as our partner, friend and guiding light. Below we present two abstracts with links to the articles. Both articles were just published in the Current Oncology journal, and available (hyperlink below) online at (I include the brief abstracts for each): Through a glass darkly: the mammography debate [Invited Editorial] About the ongoing breast cancer screening mammography debate - less a controversy, because many points of consensus and convergence are present if not always apparent - we can make these points as prelude: that it is complex; that it is naïvely implausible to expect any decisive final resolution to the residual issues that will be convincing to the principle contending parties; and that behind it all, the devil is in the methodology. In this editorial we propose: (1) a greater focus on moving beyond the current borders of the mammography debate to secure superior screening technologies that will erode the central status currently occupied by conventional mammography; (2) making research advances that will minimize the harms, especially of overdiagnosis (overdetection); and (3) furthering research to provide validated markers for the discrimination of low-risk and indolent disease. Beyond the mammography debate: a moderate perspective [Perspectives in Oncology Review] After some decades of contention, one can almost despair and conclude that (paraphrasing) “the mammography debate you will have with you always.” Against that sentiment, in this review I argue, after reflecting on some of the major themes of this long-standing debate, that we must begin to move beyond the narrow borders of claim and counterclaim to seek consensus on what the balance of methodologically sound and critically appraised evidence demonstrates, and also to find overlooked underlying convergences; after acknowledging the reality of some residual and non-trivial harms from mammography, to promote effective strategies for harm mitigation; and to encourage deployment of new screening modalities that will render many of the issues and concerns in the debate obsolete. To these ends, I provide a sketch of what this looking forward and beyond the current debate might look like, leveraging advantages from abbreviated breast magnetic resonance imaging technologies (such as the ultra fast and twist protocols) and from digital breast tomosynthesis—also known as three-dimensional mammography. I also locate the debate within the broader context of mammography in the real world as it plays out not for the disputants, but for the stakeholders themselves: the screening-eligible patients and the physicians in the front lines who are charged with enabling both the acts of screening and the facts of screening at their maximally objective and patient-accessible levels to facilitate informed decisions.

1054,66,12,6,6,2015,2015-06-06,"The take-away: Post operative pain in breast cancer surgery can be quite difficult for the patient particularly in the setting of sentinel node and axilla dissection. This scientific article shows ways to help control the pain. It is most fortunate that acetaminophen is now available in an IV form because it can be given in the recovery room to enhance pain relief. Opioids are not always the answer or the best choice in controlling pain; their side effects often outweigh their benefits. Localized (regional) pain relief with either a long acting numbing agent administered before the patient awakens from anesthesia and/or the insertion of a pain pump that delivers numbing action directly to the surgical site can “break the cycle” of pain before it begins for the patient. Thus, the patient feels better in recovery and is able to begin the healing process without pain being the main focus. There is even some evidence that avoiding opioid use may improve survival, but there needs to be more studies to investigate this further. Improving Patient Outcomes Through State-of-the-Art Pain Control in Breast Cancer Surgery Jacob L. Hutchins, MD Abstract Acute post surgical pain continues to be difficult to manage in patients who undergo breast cancer surgery. Poorly controlled pain can lead to poor patient satisfaction, increased length of stay, and increased risk of opioid adverse events, and may be a factor in the development of chronic pain. A multimodal analgesic regimen that consists of 2 or more non-opioid medications and is initiated in the preoperative phase and continued during the intraoperative and acute postoperative phases may provide the best patient outcomes. These nonopioid medications include, but are not limited to, local anesthetics, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiepileptics, alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, and glucocorticoids. This multimodal approach can be a stand-alone protocol or a part of a more comprehensive enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Postoperative pain control remains a common problem for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. A recent survey showed that patients’ number one concern leading up to surgery is pain. Uncontrolled, acute postoperative pain can lead to an increased surgical stress response. This then has an effect on endocrine, metabolic, inflammatory, and immune functions, which can further stress various organ systems. Appropriate pain control can lead to improved postoperative outcomes as well as decreased pulmonary and cardiac complications. In addition, uncontrolled acute postoperative pain is associated with longer stays in the postanesthesia care unit, longer hospital stays, decreased patient satisfaction and quality of life, and increased costs. Furthermore, while multifactorial in nature, the incidence of chronic pain may be decreased by an aggressive multimodal approach in the acute postoperative setting. As many as 4% to 63% of patients suffer chronic pain after mastectomy, and as such, effective acute pain control remains paramount to patient recovery following breast cancer surgery. The mainstay of perioperative pain control has been opioids. However, opioids are associated with significant risks and adverse effects (AEs) such as pruritus, constipation, nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, oversedation, and respiratory depression. A recent sentinel event alert by The Joint Commission expressed the need for safe use of opioids in the hospital setting. This alert identified those most at risk for respiratory depression, including patients with obstructive sleep apnea or those who are opioid-naïve or obese, which are common characteristics of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Furthermore, opioid abuse is an ever-increasing problem in the United States. A recent survey in 2010 showed that 5.1 million US citizens had used opioids illicitly within the past month. Finding ways to minimize opioids in the treatment of perioperative pain may not only decrease AEs, but also decrease the exposure and subsequent misuse of opioids in society. A multimodal approach has been used for perioperative pain control in various surgical procedures. Multimodal analgesia is the use of more than 1 class of nonopioid medication to reduce pain and minimize the AEs of any 1 class of pain medication. These medications act via different mechanisms and produce a synergistic effect on acute pain control. A successful multimodal protocol requires coordination between all phases of care: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Furthermore, the surgical, anesthesia, and nursing teams must all work together to ensure that all aspects of the multimodal plan are followed. The Table lists a sample multimodal approach for breast cancer surgery. A preoperative regimen could consist of an antiepileptic medication, such as gabapentin or pregabalin, acetaminophen, and regional anesthesia. Preemptive analgesia ensures that the medication given is active before and during surgery. This also may decrease afferent transmission of pain signals and decrease acute postoperative pain. Several studies have shown opioid reduction and decreased acute and chronic pain using preemptive antiepileptics such as gabapentin or pregabalin. Regional anesthesia for breast cancer surgery could be either paravertebral blocks, pec blocks, or a thoracic epidural injection. These blocks can be either a single-shot block or a continuous infusion via catheter. Several studies have shown decreased postoperative pain when these regional techniques are used for breast surgery. If a transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) or deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is performed, the use of transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) has also been shown to decrease postoperative opioid use and pain scores. Intraoperatively, pain control should consist of zero to minimal short-acting opioids and a redose of acetaminophen if adequate time has passed. If the patient didn’t receive preoperative regional anesthesia, then the surgeon should perform infiltration with local anesthetics. This can be liposomal bupivacaine, bupivacaine, or ropivacaine, or placement of a continuous wound infiltration catheter. The local anesthetic of choice for infiltration should be the one that provides the longest duration of action in order to provide maximal patient benefit. Liposomal bupivacaine, given via single-shot infiltration, may provide more prolonged or extended analgesia postoperatively than standard local anesthetics. Recent data have shown liposomal bupivacaine given via infiltration to be an effective adjunct for postoperative pain control in breast augmentation and reduction. In addition, continuous peripheral or wound catheters can provide several days of pain relief using a continuous infusion of local anesthetic. The postoperative pain regimen should consist of scheduled acetaminophen, scheduled antiepileptics, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as soon as allowed, and intermittent short-acting opioids. This postoperative regimen should be continued for up to 1 week after surgery. In addition, complementary therapies such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, and healing touch can be offered to the patient. If a continuous catheter is in place, the infusion should consist of, at minimum, a local anesthetic and should be used in the acute postoperative period. In addition to the medications listed in the preceding paragraphs and the Table, several other classes of medications can also be used pending patient selection. Intravenous lidocaine has been used to decrease acute postsurgical pain in many surgical populations. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as ketamine and magnesium may play a role in central sensitization. The alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine have been used in multimodal approaches in other surgical procedures with success, as they primarily act at the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Finally, glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone have been used to minimize inflammation and postoperative pain. A comprehensive multimodal pain regimen will provide the patient with the most complete pain control. It will minimize opioids, which not only will minimize opioid-related AEs and opioid misuse, but may decrease cancer recurrence. A retrospective study by Exadaktylos et al showed that paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia decreased breast cancer recurrence rates. Prospective studies have shown that paravertebral anesthetics, as opposed to general anesthetic with opioids and inhalation anesthetics, resulted in increased natural killer cell cytotoxicity as well as increased apoptosis in estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer cells. In conclusion, this review of a multimodal approach to acute postsurgical pain can provide a framework for managing patients’ pain after breast cancer surgery. This could be used alone or in combination with an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol to improve patients’ postsurgical outcomes. However, future prospective randomized studies are needed to determine the exact combinations and dosages of multimodal medications to provide the optimal benefit for patients.

1055,66,13,2,6,2015,2015-06-02,"This is very exciting and long awaited news. I have seen too many people who have exhausted all their options, and who were physically eligible for a new, targeted treatment, only to be turned down because it has not been approved for metastatic use or they are excluded because of all their previous therapies. When you have no more choices, access to potentially life extending drugs is your only hope. Finally, ASCO understands this and five pharmaceutical companies are on board. This is a major breakthrough for advanced disease patients. All solid tumor and blood cancer patients are included. I have had friends with advanced lung and breast cancer beg for compassionate access only to be denied because of red tape. This trial will change that. Bravo ASCO and thank you. ASCO Launches First-ever Clinical Trial: Aims to Learn from Patients with Advanced Cancer Who Lack Standard Treatment Options Five Leading Pharmaceutical Companies Will Support Innovative Study, Contribute Drugs CHICAGO – The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) today announced its first-ever clinical trial that will offer patients with advanced cancer access to molecularly-targeted cancer drugs and collect “real-world” data on clinical outcomes to help learn the best uses of these drugs outside of indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plans for the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) study, including the participation of major pharmaceutical companies that will contribute free drugs, were released in a news briefing at the Society’s 2015 Annual Meeting in Chicago. The ASCO-sponsored prospective, non-randomized clinical trial will collect information on the anti-tumor activity and toxicity of commercially available, targeted cancer drugs in a range of cancer types, including any advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a genomic variation known to be a drug target. “Oncologists often use therapies approved for a specific cancer indication to treat people with other types of advanced cancer, but we very rarely learn from that experience to benefit other patients,” said ASCO President Peter Paul Yu, MD, FACP, FASCO. “TAPUR will document the real-world experience of patients who receive commercially available targeted anti-cancer drugs and will describe the effectiveness and side effects of a range of targeted agents available in this study.” ASCO will organize the operational aspects of the study, including the participation of multiple collaborators that are central to TAPUR’s success. TAPUR will involve not only patients and physicians, but also ASCO oversight committees, pharmaceutical companies, technology firms, and community-based study sites—representing a uniquely innovative and inclusive approach to studying the use of molecularly-targeted cancer drugs. “We are leveraging ASCO’s unique ability to bring together a diverse group of collaborators to undertake something that’s never been done before, all while simplifying access to multiple cancer treatments across many tumor types,” said ASCO Chief Medical Officer Richard L. Schilsky, MD, FASCO. “Perhaps even more importantly, TAPUR will involve community-based research programs, where the majority of cancer patients receive treatment and will provide education and support to community oncologists to help them interpret complex genomic tests.” TAPUR Next Steps In the coming months, an Institutional Review Board will review the study protocol and consent form. In addition, ASCO has established three oversight committees—each of which will include patient representatives, clinical oncologists, statisticians, and genomics specialists: • Steering Committee to oversee study operations, establish data sharing and publication policies, review plans to add or remove drugs from the study, and approve participation of clinical study sites; • Molecular Tumor Board to review the proposed drug-target match and suggest therapies on or off the study; • Data and Safety Monitoring Board to regularly review study results to ensure that severe or unexpected adverse events are carefully monitored, to determine when enrollment of study cohorts should expand or cease, and to determine when to release data and to which parties. Patient Participation TAPUR is designed to include a broader patient population than is typically enrolled in clinical trials. It will accept patients who have any advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma, or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and are no longer responding to standard anti-cancer treatment or for whom no acceptable treatment is available. Patients will be screened to determine if they are healthy enough to participate based on broad inclusion/exclusion criteria. If and when a patient meets the defined trial criteria, his or her treating physician will select a drug from among those available in the TAPUR study protocol that targets the identified genomic variation in the patient’s tumor. If a relevant drug-target match is not described in the protocol, a physician may consult the Molecular Tumor Board which will review the clinical and genomic features of the case and suggest potential therapies on or off the study. All patients who receive treatment through TAPUR will be monitored for standard toxicity and efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as duration of treatment. Patients participating in TAPUR will receive the anti-cancer drugs at no charge. It is expected that routine clinical care costs will be covered by the patient’s insurance plan. Participating Organizations ASCO has invited a number of pharmaceutical companies to provide marketed, targeted drugs and additional resources to support the development of the new study’s infrastructure. At the time of this announcement, ASCO reported that the following companies have signed memoranda of understanding agreeing to participate in the TAPUR study: • AstraZeneca • Bristol-Myers Squibb • Eli Lilly and Company • Genentech • Pfizer “At least 13 drugs that target more than 15 unique genomic variants will be provided by these companies. We are extremely grateful for the generosity of these companies without whose support TAPUR would not be possible,” said ASCO President Dr. Yu. “We anticipate additional companies will sign on, and are extremely encouraged with the level of interest we have received so far.” ASCO will launch the TAPUR study at clinical sites that comprise the Michigan Cancer Research Consortium, the Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan, and the Carolinas Healthcare System—existing research networks that run research trials for the National Cancer Institute and industry—with the ultimate goal of expanding nationally. Two technology companies will provide key support to manage, analyze, and interpret the study data: Syapse will provide its Syapse Precision Medicine Platform to automate the study workflow and the Molecular Tumor Board process, and capture structured data from participating practices. Illumina will provide its NextBio knowledge base platform to support and inform the case review by the Molecular Tumor Board, as well as to support analysis of the TAPUR data by the study team. Finally, the Society will collaborate and share data with the Netherlands Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment, which is conducting a clinical trial using a study protocol very similar to TAPUR. “We are very fortunate that this leading cancer center has the same focus as TAPUR,” said Dr. Schilsky. “Technological advancements will allow us to pool our information in a seamless fashion and give us the ability to learn from the experience of a larger group of patients.” Patient Advocates to Play Key Role in TAPUR Patient advocates will play a central role throughout the study, providing guidance and oversight support. Jane Perlmutter, PhD, a cancer survivor and nationally recognized patient advocate, is lending her expertise in trial development and will help coordinate patient advocate recruitment and training for the study. “TAPUR has enormous potential to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of currently available therapies in treating cancers with genomic variations and to learn from patients who are treated with off-label drugs,” said Dr. Perlmutter. “I applaud ASCO for undertaking this important study and believe its findings will improve cancer care, especially for those with advanced cancer for whom traditional therapies are no longer working.” For more information about TAPUR, please go to http://www.asco.org/TAPUR.",0,1,0.11821338383838384
1056,66,14,1,6,2015,2015-06-01,"Promising clinical trial results presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2015 show activity of the investigational anti-cancer agent ONT-380 against HER2+ breast cancer, in one case specifically against brain metastases and in another case in overall survival of heavily pretreated HER2+ breast cancer patients. ""I am thrilled to have been able to offer this therapy to a patient in her early 40s. She didn't have any other great treatment options that we would have expected to have any meaningful impact, especially on her brain. Now she's been on the study over a year. The mets in her body are gone and the brain lesion has shrunk down to a little nubbin. She's living a normal life, fretting about the family business and how the kids are doing -- normal stuff,"" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center and one of the study's authors. Both sets of results being presented are from ongoing phase 1b clinical trials of ONT-380, one in combination with the drug TDM-1, and the other in combination with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab. Women on these studies include those whose disease had progressed after at least two previous rounds of therapy (sometimes including previous drugs used to target HER2). In the first study of ONT-380 with TDM-1, all 8 evaluable patients experienced more than 50 percent reduction in primary brain tumor size. ""This drug has the potential to be the long-awaited, needed therapy that targets brain metastases in HER2+ brain cancer, and could even someday be used to prevent brain metastases in the first place,"" says Borges. The second study presents overall response rates from a similar, ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of ONT-380 with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab. Of 8 heavily pretreated patients enrolled on the study, 4 showed partial response (reduction in tumor size of more than 30 percent), 2 achieved stable disease, and 2 progressed. In about 25 percent of the 1-in-8 women who will develop breast cancer during their lifetimes, the HER2 gene creates an abnormal amount of HER2 protein, which acts as a ""receptor"" for human epidermal growth factor. The presence of more HER2 receptors allows a cell to trap more growth-promoting hormones, which tells the cell to grow in an out-of-control, cancerous way. ONT-380, invented by Array Biopharma in Boulder, CO and now being developed by Oncothyreon in Seattle, WA, is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 ""tyrosine kinase"" -- a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain. ""Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,"" Borges says. University of Colorado Cancer Center.

1057,66,15,13,5,2015,2015-05-13,"Television chef, Sandra Lee, has discovered she has breast cancer. It is apparently quite aggressive because her doctors have informed her she is a ""ticking time bomb"" and she will be undergoing a bilateral mastectomy this week. Ms. Lee is in her forties. She insisted on getting screened for breast cancer which is smart. She does not have a family history, but that didn't stop her. Perhaps she knew that eighty percent of breast cancers are found in people without a family history. By finding her tumor early, she has the best chance of fighting it. She will have the cancerous tissue removed, receive the therapy necessary to eradicate the remaining cells, and if all goes well, she has an over ninety percent chance of beating the disease if it has not spread to her other organs. This is all common sense. If we can find a disease early and treat it why would we ever take that for granted? It is a question for the United States Task Force, a government sanctioned group that insists that women should not have their first mammogram until after the age of 50. Where would that leave Ms. Lee? If she is a ticking time bomb now, what would become of her in a few years when she is ""allowed"" to obtain screening? In today's NY Times, Ms. Lee is said, “Without early detection on my side, I could be telling a very different story,” she said. “Or not be here to tell it at all.” The Times went on to report on the task force's two sided view: Regular mammograms for women in their 40s can be controversial. In April, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a government panel, suggested that while mammograms are most beneficial for women over 50, mammograms for women in the 40s can “reduce their risk of dying from breast cancer.” And yet, they continue the most dangerous message of all: Still the task force’s draft regulations also stated that women “undergoing regular screening mammography are at risk for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer that would otherwise not have become a threat.” This is one of the most misinformed statements of the century. There is no such thing as a breast cancer that would ""not become a threat."" How do they know which cancer cells choose to divide and duplicate and take over a woman's body and kill her? Who are they to make this decision for women? I was first diagnosed in my thirties. My original tumor was partially DCIS, meaning it was in situ, or ""non-invasive"" as the Task Force likes to call it. However, the tumor broke through the duct and became invasive, very invasive with a triple negative pathology. Where would I be now if I had waited 12 more years before my first mammogram? I would not have been here. My second breast cancer was in the lobes and rapidly spread to my lymph nodes. This was only five and half years after my first cancer. Two aggressive cancers, both under the age of the Task Force's permitted age for screening. At the No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation, we go a step further. We believe in baseline screening before the age of forty. Screening that saved my life in my thirties should be available to everyone. And women in high risk groups, particularly women of African American descent, need to be screened as early as possible because they are at the greatest risk of the finding the most aggressive forms of breast cancer while still in their thirties. Ms. Lee's long time companion is New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo. In the same NY Times article, he said, “She had always been diligent about her exams, and thank God she had been diligent about her exams,” the governor said, adding, “If she waited until she was 50, this would be a very different situation.” Mr. Cuomo, as a fellow Long Islander and breast cancer survivor, after you are done helping the lovely Ms. Lee through her ordeal, please help the women of your state and then, hopefully, the nation. Eliminate the US Task Force's guidelines any way you can. Please, look into our Before Forty Initiative to help us spread the word of the risk young women face for aggressive breast cancers. The No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation has been fighting hard for a long time. We could use your help. Ms. Lee, we are here for you. We can help you through each step of your journey. And, personally, as someone who has been there, I am here to tell you that you can get through this and you will get your life back.

1058,66,16,9,2,2015,2015-02-09,"WNYC and NPR present “LIVING CANCER” To Air Nationally on NPR’s Morning Edition and All Things Considered During the Weeks of February 9 and March 23 Nationally, one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with the disease, and almost every American family is touched by the disease in some way. In the past, a cancer diagnosis was often kept a family secret with a grim prognosis. Now, thanks to advances in treatment, many people are ""living cancer"" - whether we're being treated ourselves, or helping a family member or friend. During the weeks of February 9 and March 23, WNYC, the premiere public radio producer and broadcaster, and NPR will present “LIVING CANCER,” a 10-story series that will examine the shifting science and economics of cancer treatment and the impact on individuals and families. New drug protocols offer hope for many, while remaining just out of reach for others. Research scientists are working to discover the root causes of cancer, but the disease process is often too complicated for simple explanations. And as more people survive for years after a cancer diagnosis, what originally was a medical crisis can often be managed as part of an everyday routine. The radio series will explore these complex realities of cancer today. “LIVING CANCER” will air on the NPR programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered, heard on public radio stations across the country. All stories from the series will be available at www.wnyc.org/cancer and www.npr.org following their broadcast premiere. A preview video may be viewed here: www.wnyc.org/story/living-cancer-video/. In addition, WNYC’s nationally-distributed program On the Media will devote an entire episode to the history of cancer and the media, premiering on March 27. The schedule of “LIVING CANCER” stories is as follows: Week of February 9 Advances in Immune Therapy of Cancer Morning Edition; February 9 One of the hottest areas of cancer research is in “immunotherapy,” which involves harnessing the immune system to attack tumors. After decades of frustration, researchers think they’ve finally figured out how to do this. A new generation of drugs essentially disables the ability of cancer cells to hide from the immune system. NPR health correspondent and editor Rob Stein reports that the treatments are showing promise for a wide range of cancers, including skin cancer, kidney cancer and lung cancer. Fighting For The Latest Treatment All Things Considered; February 9 Kathy Liu is desperately trying to find a cure for her 10-year-old son Joey, who was diagnosed last year with late-stage kidney cancer. She’s petitioning the FDA and three major drug companies to gain access to new immunotherapy drugs, treatment she believes is their only hope. The drug was approved in September, but that hasn’t meant she can get it yet. Amanda Aronczyk of WNYC reports that Kathy Liu needs to decide how far she’ll go with current treatments — that barely work and are very toxic — to keep Joey alive until the “miracle” drug becomes available for kids. What’s The Prognosis? Morning Edition; February 10 “Doctor, how long do I have to live?” That question, and the answer — an estimated amount of time that a patient might have left — can define what a patient will and won’t do with their remaining time. But how accurate is the prognosis, and where does the data come from? And how can doctors and patients make that important question, and answer, less fraught? WNYC’s Amanda Aronczyk reports. Pregnant With Cancer All Things Considered; February 10 Last year, when WNYC health editor Mary Harris was 35, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the process of preparing for treatment, she also found out that she was pregnant. This story traces her journey through pregnancy, chemo, birth and the early infancy of her daughter, Stella. We follow her through the wrenching decisions she and her husband had to make from deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy, to the risks of undergoing chemo in the third trimester. Pregnancy in cancer is rare — estimated at 1 in 3,000 cancer cases. But it is also estimated to be growing, because more and more women are getting cancer screenings that mean a diagnosis comes early; and more and more women are putting off childbearing to their 30s or later. Environmental Exposures and Cancer Morning Edition; February 11 From 1959 to 1967, 20,000 pregnant women in California enrolled in the Child Health and Development Study and agreed to provide blood samples throughout their pregnancy and beyond. Now, some of those children are getting cancers. Researcher Barbara Cohn is looking back at the samples from pregnancy to see if she can find evidence of chemical exposures in the womb. She is also sending her data on to the first NIH funded exposome research center at Emory University, where they will test those samples for evidence of thousands of chemicals — a process made possible only with new technology. WNYC’s Paige Cowett reports. Week of March 23 (specific airdates and times forthcoming) Where are we with the War on Cancer? Medical researchers have made only modest progress treating the most common cancers since the war on cancer was declared in 1971. A fundamental reason is that scientists are still struggling to make sense of the underlying biology. One noted scientist says understanding has seemingly come full circle... from mind-boggling complexity, to seeming simplicity, and back again to complexity. NPR’s science correspondent Richard Harris explores whether cancer research is in fact lost in an intellectual thicket. Chronic Cancer As many people live longer with cancer, the disease has become a chronic condition that’s manageable, but filled with regular treatments and a persistent underlying uncertainty. Dixie Josephson was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic ovarian cancer 14 years ago. WNYC’s Paige Cowett follows Dixie and her family through her latest round of treatments. Exceptional Responders In a clinical trial for the immunotherapy drug, Sunitinib, most patients with aggressive kidney cancer failed to respond. But a handful of patients responded remarkably well. The New York Genome Center is collaborating with Memorial Sloan Kettering to do comprehensive gene sequencing, with the hopes of figuring out what these “exceptional responders” have in common, and what we can learn from them about treating cancer. WNYC’s Amanda Aronczyk reports. Paying for Cancer Melinda Townsend-Breslin knows more than anyone would want to about paying for cancer. When her mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2013, her parents thought they’d be fine; they had what they considered “Cadillac” care. But the costs still added up, leaving her father with a stunning $500,000 bill when her mother died just eight months later. Melinda knows better than anyone that this shouldn’t happen: she’s a patient advocate in Louisville, Kentucky. She was able to negotiate their bills down to $125,000. But the experience left her with so many questions: why did her parents invest in “cancer insurance” so many years back, when it barely helped at all? How could her mother survive for just eight months and still have so many bills? WNYC’s Amanda Aroncyzk reports. Early Trials Today, children diagnosed with ALL, a common form of leukemia, have an 80%-90% chance of surviving if detected early. It is one of the most dramatic reversals in the history of cancer treatment: only a few decades ago, the survival rate was closer to 4%. In the 1960s, Pat Patchell and James Eversull were kids diagnosed with leukemia and both were part of the first cohort of patients to be taken off treatment, because they were responding so well. They are now middle-aged men, 62 and 52 years of age respectively, and WNYC’s Amanda Aroncyzk checks in to see how life turned out for them, and examines how those early trials sent the precedent for cancer treatment as we know it today.

1059,66,17,10,1,2015,2015-01-10,"Thirteen and half years ago I was told I would not see beyond two years because I had the most aggressive form of breast cancer and after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, there was nothing I could do about protecting myself for the future. I read up on what the latest research was. There was not much. Back then, it was called estrogen and progesterone negative breast cancer. Now it has a fancy name, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, which means the same thing: It does not have receptors that are fueled by estrogen or progesterone and it is does not carry the protein Her2Nue. All that means is that there are not drugs to block the estrogen and it does not benefit from the breakthrough drug Herceptin. I found that exercise, a low fat diet, flax seeds and vitamin D were my only allies. I also found many other women who were diagnosed with the disease. Many of whom are no longer alive. The Before Forty Initiative was started to help young women, especially in certain populations, to get early screening as the only defense against the disease. The following report is the most promising thing I have yet to find. Researchers at Cambridge University have identified the TNBC gene. This is huge. This has the potential to make an often unmanageable disease into one that can actually be prevented. This is what HOPE looks like. We are moving forward, at long last. Breast cancer breakthrough as Cambridge University finds gene behind killer disease Cambridge University and the Wellcome Trust’s Sanger Institute have discovered the gene responsible for triple negative breast cancer The gene BCL11A is likely to be behind triple negative breast cancer By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/113360... Scientists have identified the gene behind one of most aggressive forms of breast cancer in a breakthrough which could bring life-saving new treatments. Triple-negative breast cancer is one of the most deadly forms of the disease and nearly one quarter of patients diagnosed will not survive for more than five years. Now researchers at Cambridge University and the Wellcome Trust’s Sanger Institute have found that the BCL11A gene is overactive in eight out of ten patients. Quote: The study opens the door for therapies which suppress the gene and for screening that would pick up the risk early when women still had time to opt for life-saving mastectomies. “Our gene studies in human cells clearly marked BCL11A as a driver for triple-negative breast cancers,” says Dr Walid Khaled of the University of Cambridge. “We also showed that adding an active human BCL11A gene to human or mouse breast cells in the lab drove them to behave as cancer cells. “As important, when we reduced the activity of BCL11A in three samples of human triple- negative breast cancer cells, they lost some characteristics of cancer cells and became less tumorigenic when tested in mice. “So by increasing BCL11A activity we increase cancer-like behaviour; by reducing it, we reduce cancer-like behaviour.” Around 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer. The disease does not respond to traditional breast cancer drugs like Herceptin and is one of the most aggressive types. Just 77 per cent of people with triple-negative breast cancer will survive for five years, compared with 93 per cent for other types of the disease. For the new study, researchers looked that the genetic profile of tumours from 3,000 patients, specifically searching for genes which affect how stem cells and tissues develop. Higher activity of the BCL11A gene was found in approximately eight out of ten patients and was associated with a more advanced grade of tumour. To test the theory that the gene was promoting tumour growth, scientists genetically engineered mice to have inactive copies. None of the animals went on to develop tumours in the mammary gland, whereas all untreated animals developed tumours. “This exciting result identifies a novel breast cancer gene in some of the more difficult-to-treat cases,” said Professor Carlos Caldas, Director of the Cambridge Breast Cancer Research Unit at the University of Cambridge. “It builds on our work to develop a comprehensive molecular understanding of breast cancer that will inform clinical decisions and treatment choices. “Finding a novel gene that is active in cancer should also help in the search for new treatments.” The breakthrough was welcomed by charities who said it could lead to new targeted treatments. Dr Emma Smith, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: “Figuring out the genes that play a role in triple negative breast cancer could lead to new ways to tackle the disease so this study is a promising step forward. “The next steps will be finding out if the gene plays the same role in causing breast cancer in women, and whether drugs can be developed to target the faulty molecules. “Triple negative breast cancer can be challenging to treat, so research into the biology of the disease is vital to help scientists come up with new treatments.” Dr Christopher Runchel, Research Officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer added: “Whilst this investigation and the discovery of a new gene driver for triple negative breast cancer was mostly confined to cell lines and mice, this work could prove promising in the search for new ways to treat this form of the disease in the future “Triple negative breast cancer is particularly aggressive and does not respond to hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen, or targeted drugs like Herceptin. That’s why the hunt for effective treatments is so important and Breakthrough Breast Cancer have long supported research like this.” The research was published in the journal Nature Communications. © Copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited 2015",0,1,0.08084907516725702

To die, to sleep-- No more--and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep-- To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprise of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. Please take a moment and read Hamlet’s words as he contemplates ending his life. Shakespeare captured the tortuous moments a deeply depressed person goes through when there seems to be no end in sight. Depression is a disease. It has some shame to it because it is “mental” and people in deep depression are often confronted with criticisms such as, “Why doesn’t he/she snap out of it?” or “He/she has everything! What do they have to be depressed about?” Depression strikes no matter what you have going on in your life. Over 600,000 people attempt suicide every year in the United States. Brilliant, creative, imaginative people seem to be the most vulnerable to depression. There is something about the creative, sensitive psyche that makes you feel things more exquisitely. The same ability to have your heart race when you see an osprey overhead carrying a fish back to the nest, or to see a sunset that can move you to tears, makes you feel other things as well. Sadness. Loneliness. Despair. You can have all the friends in the world and you can have a loving, wonderful family, but they cannot heal your spirit. Only you can do that. And it takes a lot of work. Before you can heal, you must travel to a very, very dark place. It was perfectly described in “Ordinary People,” written by Judith Guest, and acted, with perfection, by Timothy Hutton. When young Conrad was asked what his depression was like that led to his suicide attempt, he opened up for the first time: Conrad: “I don't know. It was like... falling into a hole. It keeps getting bigger and bigger and you can't escape. All of a sudden, it's inside... and you're the hole. You're trapped. And it's all over. Something like that. It's not really scary... except when you think back on it. 'Cause you know what you were feeling.” His wise psychiatrist tells him later, “ Let me tell you something about feelings, Kiddo. They don’t always tickle.” And so this leads me to Robin Williams. I keep hearing people saying, “He was so funny! How could this happen?” The person who opens their heart and makes everyone else feel good, doesn’t necessarily make himself feel better. In fact, it is a temporary tonic for them for the moment. And then they return to their lives and they are not laughing. Real life is not a stage. Real life does not include adoring fans. Real life for someone in a deep depression, who is trying to stay sober, who is facing money troubles, who has to maintain a happy face to the public, can be overwhelming. Sometimes it is just too much to be the strong, happy, brilliant, funny guy. And perhaps that is how Mr. Williams felt. He did the only thing he felt he could do to stop the pain. It is tragic and sad. I personally loved Robin Williams. He was a genius in my mind. And geniuses fight the hardest battles. When Christopher Reeve had his riding accident and had to get intensive therapy, Robin Williams, his roommate at Julliard, paid the expenses. He was a generous soul. He gave and gave of himself until there was nothing left to give in his mind. In the spirit of his generous heart, if you know someone who may be suffering, reach out. It can be something as simple as, “If you ever want to have a cup of coffee or maybe just watch tv together, I would love to hang out with you.” And then, when you are together, just let them be. Don’t ask more of them than they can be. Don’t make them entertain you. Just be their friend. If you see warning signs: Lack of sleep, loss of appetite, overuse of alcohol or drugs, sleeping too much, or not caring about their appearance, seek help for them. Suicide has been happening long before Shakespeare wrote about it so eloquently. Depression is now recognized as a legitimate disease. And people can recover from it. It takes work. And sometimes you have to feel worse before you feel better. But you can get better. So with that knowledge, if you need to hear it for yourself, believe it. Or if you need to know for a friend or someone else you love, let them know and help them find help.",0,1,0.22358225108225102
1062,66,2,6,2,2016,2016-02-06,"We have long been strong supporters of the work being done at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Today, an article that appeared in Long Island's Newsday, shows that there is much to hope for. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory researcher explores antisense technology to defeat cancer http://www.newsday.com/long-island/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-researcher-explores-antisense-technology-to-defeat-cancer-1.11442078?view=print February 6, 2016 By Delthia Ricks When the director of research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory examined his first specimen of cells treated with an experimental breast cancer therapeutic, he was stunned. David Spector is a seasoned scientist long used to groundbreaking results and he went into the project with a strong hypothesis. Yet, he didn’t quite know what to expect. He is exploring a treatment strategy called “antisense technology” and the outcome of his first test proved so spectacular that it served as one of those rare Eureka moments when a result surprises even a veteran investigator. “I didn’t expect it,” said Spector, enthused that a scientific endeavor can still be marked by the unexpected. “We were hopeful that something would come out of it. Of course, we didn’t know how dramatic the effect would be.” Aggressive cancer cells, which had overwhelmed the specimen, were no longer visible once exposed to the novel therapy. To Spector’s surprise, the cells had undergone a substantial character change, becoming large fluid-filled and static having lost 70 percent their ability to mobilize as metastatic tumor cells. He and his team have repeated the experiments countless times, and have subdued cancerous cells with each effort. Antisense technology involves the identification of aberrant RNA — a cousin to life’s commander molecule — that can persist at the core of some cancers. Then, it involves synthesizing a deactivating sequence — an antisense strand — that binds to the renegade RNA to trigger its destruction. The implications of the findings are enormous, Spector said, given the seriousness of this form of breast cancer — advanced disease that spreads. If the war on cancer nearly a half century ago relied largely on “slash, burn and poison” as methods to fight cancer through surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, then evolving efforts designed to conquer the disease will have to venture deeper into uncharted regions of the cancer cell, mainly its inner sanctum — the nucleus — where DNA and RNA reside, scientists say. Spector’s form of research is the kind that some experts say will be needed if there is to be a genuine “moonshot” effort to defeat all cancers, a challenge issued by President Barack Obama in his final state of the union address last month. Advanced breast cancer is a significant public health concern, according to the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network, an advocacy organization for patients, which estimates that 6 percent to 10 percent of breast cancer cases are Stage IV and metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis. Yet, others are at risk as well — patients whose cancers are resistant to standard treatments and those whose disease inexplicably rebounds after remission. Patients are watching anxiously as Spector’s research progresses. “This is very important work, very important for us, ” said Joanne Marquardt of West Islip, an 11-year breast cancer survivor. She describes the potential for metastatic disease as the shadow that haunts some women — and men — years after successful treatment. To date, Spector’s research has mostly involved mouse mammary cells. And while he underscores the preliminary nature of his experiments, Spector is well aware that he has embarked on compelling scientific terrain. Experts outside his lab are also excited about the approach. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a Southern California company, has already joined the effort to develop Spector’s antisense concept into a treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Human clinical trials are expected within the next 18 months, said Frank Bennett, vice president of research at Ionis. Spector and postdoctoral fellow, Gayatri Arun, the lead associate in the lab, journeyed into the nucleus of cells to target an engine of cancer development: the mystifying molecular segments that scientists call long non-coding RNA. These sequences were once called junk RNA. Investigators now know they are hardly junk and probably play active roles in other forms of cancer as well as disorders that have no relationship to malignancies. “There is no junk RNA,” but there are some RNAs, Bennett noted, whose function remains a mystery. His company also studies non-coding RNAs and develops antisense therapeutics for a wide range of medical conditions. Like DNA, RNA is a nucleic acid and each is governed by a special alphabet, the letters of life. For DNA those letters are A,T, C and G. RNA’s alphabet is A, U, C, and G. Each letter represents the name of a nucleic acid, the basic building blocks of genes, which spell the code for a specific protein. DNA, a double-stranded spiraling helix, carries the blueprint for proteins. RNA, a single stranded molecule, is involved in transcribing DNA’s code. As it turns out, some forms of RNA — non-coding RNAs — are not involved in transcription. For years, long non-coding RNA remained woefully understudied, persisting as a bewildering chapter in the story of genetics. But work, such as Spector’s and a growing number of other scientists has begun to shed light on this dark matter of the genome. Long non-coding RNA may underlie some forms of lung cancer, studies have shown, as well as certain types of heart disease, particularly cardiac fibrosis, a condition marked by abnormal thickening of the heart’s valves. Spector has targeted a long non-coding sequence of RNA called Malat1, which has played an underappreciated role in aggressive breast cancer. Spector and his team found Malat1 to be overabundant in tumor cells of those diagnosed with the disease. “In the past, when scientists were looking for targets to treat cancer, the hunt for the most part, had been among the proteins. Very little work had been directed toward these other RNAs,” Spector said. “This is a remarkable class to target because we can attack them in ways that are different from the way we target proteins.” “In terms of RNA,” Spector said, “we are basically talking about sequences of letters.” For example, if the long-noncoding RNA target sequence is A, G, C, U, Spector said of RNA’s alphabet, then the “antisense” sequence to quell it would be A, G, C, T, borrowing from DNA’s lexicon. Malat1 is dozens upon dozens of letters long, but when only 16 to 20 antisense molecules bind to it, an enzyme is automatically recruited by the cell that destroys the entire stretch of cancer-causing Malat1. The reason is explained by evolution: Double-stranded RNA is alien, even to a cancer cell. That is why the enzyme quickly assembles — to destroy any inkling of a double-stranded RNA. Tumor proliferation is halted when Malat1 is destroyed. Spector credits the vast Human Genome Project with opening new windows of understanding into hidden regions of the genome. Sixteen years after the project’s end, discoveries about poorly understood forms of RNA are still paying dividends, he said. His antisense approach was well under way when Obama called for a “moonshot” effort to conquer cancer. The American Cancer Society is welcoming the presidential challenge noting that innovative approaches that are off the beaten path can help spur a new understanding of the processes driving tumors. “Cancer will not be cured this year,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, an oncologist and chief medical officer for the cancer society “but we should do all we can to ensure 2016 is remembered as the year we came together in an effort to work smartly. “It is imperative,” he said, “that we continue to fund the brightest minds.” In West Islip, Marquardt, a research advocate with the West Islip Breast Cancer Coalition, views Spector among the brightest minds. She is excited about the prospects of his antisense therapy moving into a clinical trial. “From what I have read of his work, this approach,” she said, “goes a long way in dealing with the problem of metastasis.” Marquardt, who serves as a consumer reviewer of studies up for grants awarded by the Department of Defense’s breast cancer research program, read Spector’s antisense research paper not for funding, but for her own edification. Marquardt hails from a family that has been stalked by the disease over multiple generations. Her grandmother had breast cancer as did her mother and aunt and now her daughter. She said metastatic breast cancer is much tougher to treat. “The fear that it can come back, that the other shoe is going to drop, is something we live with,” said Marquardt, a retired biology and Earth science teacher. Spector’s innovative approach to dramatically slow and possibly stop the disease, she said, fuels the hope of survivors worldwide.",0,1,0.08017167973535896
1063,66,20,7,8,2014,2014-08-07,"The No Surrender Breast Cancer Foundation's Before Forty Initiative strongly advocates the importance of early screening for breast cancer in women before the age of forty and not waiting until after forty for baseline screenings. This is particularly true for women of African-American, Hispanic and Ashkenazi heritage, because when breast cancer develops in these populations, it is most often the aggressive triple negative breast cancer. Women who have the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutation can be tested before their cancer is found, and can take protective measures such as a prophylactic mastectomies, to reduce their risk of developing the disease. A new gene mutation has been discovered that is most closely related to younger women and triple negative breast cancer. It is called the PALB2. The following is a report from the New York Times, detailing the findings. Study Shows Third Gene as Indicator for Breast Cancer By NICHOLAS BAKALAR AUG. 6, 2014 Mutations in a gene called PALB2 raise the risk of breast cancer in women by almost as much as mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, the infamous genes implicated in most inherited cases of the disease, a team of researchers reported Wednesday. Previous data had indicated that mutations in PALB2 were linked to breast cancer, and many genetic tests already screen for them. But it had not been clear to what extent these mutations raised a carrier’s odds of developing the disease. Dr. Marc Tischkowitz, an associate professor of medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues studied 362 members of 154 families with PALB2 mutations. None had BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, but all had at least one family member with breast cancer and a mutation in PALB2. There were 311 women with PALB2 mutations, of whom 229 had breast cancer, and 51 men with the mutation, of whom seven had the disease. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Over all, the researchers found, a PALB2 mutation carrier had a 35 percent chance of developing cancer by age 70. By comparison, women with BRCA1 mutations have a 50 percent to 70 percent chance of developing breast cancer by that age, and those with BRCA2 have a 40 percent to 60 percent chance. The lifetime risk for breast cancer in the general population is about 12 percent. The breast cancer risk for women younger than 40 with PALB2 mutation was eight to nine times as high as that of the general population. The risk was six to eight times as high among women 40 to 60 with these mutations, and five times as high among women older than 60. The scientists were not able to explain why younger women with the mutations were at higher risk. And there were too few men, Dr. Tischkowitz said, to make a judgment about their risk. The data also indicated that women with the PALB2 mutations were slightly more likely to have “triple negative” breast cancer — a form resistant to hormone treatment, more aggressive, and more likely to recur than other subtypes. Dr. Anees B. Chagpar, the director of the breast center at Yale-New Haven Hospital, who was not involved in the work, said she was impressed with the study but cautioned that other factors must be considered in evaluating a woman’s risk. “This has to be tailored to the patients, who may have other mutations and varying family risk,” she said. “With no family history, the increase they found is 35 percent. If you have two or more family members with cancer, they found a risk of 58 percent.” The study used data from 14 sites in eight countries but found no significant geographic variations in its prevalence. The researchers write that larger studies are needed to detect such differences, as well as to assess the role of lifestyle and hormone use on breast cancer risk in PALB2 mutation carriers. Breast cancer risk depends not just on genes, but how they interact with the environment. Official guidelines do not recommend screening for breast cancer genes in most women, only for those with a family history of the disease. Dr. Tischkowitz said that such women should consider testing for PALB2 mutations if they are negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Dr. Chagpar said: “As the testing becomes more common, we’ll hopefully end up with studies with thousands of patients in them. We’re going to start getting answers to hard questions.” A version of this article appears in print on August 7, 2014, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Shows Third Gene as Indicator for Cancer. © 2014 The New York Times Company",0,1,0.07651641414141414

1067,66,5,7,8,2015,2015-08-07,"We are advocates of a healthy, evidence-based CAM regimen. However, when undergoing chemotherapy, it is not advisable to supplement unless expressly permitted by your doctor. Of all the supplements out there, the only one that appears to be safe, and essential for the rest of our lives, is Vitamin D. All other ""vitamins"" can be detrimental to the effectiveness of your chemotherapy killing cancer cells. To put it simply, vitamins and supplements are anti-oxidants, chemotherapy is an oxidant. By taking supplementation that fights oxidants- you are fighting the chemo. One case in particular is fish oil. As this study from Clinical Oncology News reports, it decreases the effectiveness of your treatment. Please read and then go over all the extra supplements you are taking while you are enduring chemotherapy. Supplements and Cancer Resistance: A Word of Caution By Maurie Markman There is considerable and understandable interest among cancer patients in a variety of strategies designed to optimize the quality of their lives during and after treatment. Patients and their families also are increasingly proactive in their search for approaches that may favorably affect clinically relevant outcomes. For these reasons, a wide variety of supplement use is common in the cancer patient population. In fact, in my experience, it is now quite common for patients to bring information to their clinic visits that they, or their families, have discovered through their own Internet-based searches so that they can inquire whether the strategy or product highlighted in the material would be relevant in their management. The specific goals of supplement use vary but include the desire to prevent or alleviate cancer or treatment-related symptoms, enhance an individual’s nutritional status or general well-being, or favorably affect natural defense mechanisms. Unfortunately, there may be legitimate concerns associated with the use of particular supplements in this setting. It is important to note, the major issue here is not the lack of evidence-based data supporting the objective validity of claims that the supplement actually produces the desired favorable effect, but rather the potential that use of the product may cause harm. For example, it has been estimated that omega-3 fatty acids, delivered most commonly in the form of fish oil, may be used by as many as 20% of patients with cancer in the United States. 1 Preclinical data have suggested that even low concentrations of certain fatty acids can result in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. 2 Furthermore, a recent study in normal volunteers showed that consumption of fish oil at doses that might be taken by patients with cancer resulted in plasma concentrations of these fatty acids that were in the range where preclinical studies had revealed the development of chemoresistance.3 Thus, although these data do not prove that the intake of fish oil with cytotoxic chemotherapy seriously interferes with the clinical effectiveness of antineoplastic treatment, one must be concerned that this could happen. Of course, it would never be possible to know in patients with cancer whether their use of fish oil had anything to do with the development of chemotherapy resistance in their cancers. However, on the basis of these data, it would be prudent for oncologists to encourage patients who are self-administering fish oil while undergoing chemotherapy to discontinue this practice and resume use of the product—if they so desire—following the completion of the cytotoxic drug program.

1069,66,7,6,6,2015,2015-06-06,"The take-away: Post operative pain in breast cancer surgery can be quite difficult for the patient particularly in the setting of sentinel node and axilla dissection. This scientific article shows ways to help control the pain. It is most fortunate that acetaminophen is now available in an IV form because it can be given in the recovery room to enhance pain relief. Opioids are not always the answer or the best choice in controlling pain; their side effects often outweigh their benefits. Localized (regional) pain relief with either a long acting numbing agent administered before the patient awakens from anesthesia and/or the insertion of a pain pump that delivers numbing action directly to the surgical site can “break the cycle” of pain before it begins for the patient. Thus, the patient feels better in recovery and is able to begin the healing process without pain being the main focus. There is even some evidence that avoiding opioid use may improve survival, but there needs to be more studies to investigate this further. Improving Patient Outcomes Through State-of-the-Art Pain Control in Breast Cancer Surgery Jacob L. Hutchins, MD Abstract Acute post surgical pain continues to be difficult to manage in patients who undergo breast cancer surgery. Poorly controlled pain can lead to poor patient satisfaction, increased length of stay, and increased risk of opioid adverse events, and may be a factor in the development of chronic pain. A multimodal analgesic regimen that consists of 2 or more non-opioid medications and is initiated in the preoperative phase and continued during the intraoperative and acute postoperative phases may provide the best patient outcomes. These nonopioid medications include, but are not limited to, local anesthetics, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiepileptics, alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, and glucocorticoids. This multimodal approach can be a stand-alone protocol or a part of a more comprehensive enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Postoperative pain control remains a common problem for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. A recent survey showed that patients’ number one concern leading up to surgery is pain. Uncontrolled, acute postoperative pain can lead to an increased surgical stress response. This then has an effect on endocrine, metabolic, inflammatory, and immune functions, which can further stress various organ systems. Appropriate pain control can lead to improved postoperative outcomes as well as decreased pulmonary and cardiac complications. In addition, uncontrolled acute postoperative pain is associated with longer stays in the postanesthesia care unit, longer hospital stays, decreased patient satisfaction and quality of life, and increased costs. Furthermore, while multifactorial in nature, the incidence of chronic pain may be decreased by an aggressive multimodal approach in the acute postoperative setting. As many as 4% to 63% of patients suffer chronic pain after mastectomy, and as such, effective acute pain control remains paramount to patient recovery following breast cancer surgery. The mainstay of perioperative pain control has been opioids. However, opioids are associated with significant risks and adverse effects (AEs) such as pruritus, constipation, nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, oversedation, and respiratory depression. A recent sentinel event alert by The Joint Commission expressed the need for safe use of opioids in the hospital setting. This alert identified those most at risk for respiratory depression, including patients with obstructive sleep apnea or those who are opioid-naïve or obese, which are common characteristics of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Furthermore, opioid abuse is an ever-increasing problem in the United States. A recent survey in 2010 showed that 5.1 million US citizens had used opioids illicitly within the past month. Finding ways to minimize opioids in the treatment of perioperative pain may not only decrease AEs, but also decrease the exposure and subsequent misuse of opioids in society. A multimodal approach has been used for perioperative pain control in various surgical procedures. Multimodal analgesia is the use of more than 1 class of nonopioid medication to reduce pain and minimize the AEs of any 1 class of pain medication. These medications act via different mechanisms and produce a synergistic effect on acute pain control. A successful multimodal protocol requires coordination between all phases of care: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Furthermore, the surgical, anesthesia, and nursing teams must all work together to ensure that all aspects of the multimodal plan are followed. The Table lists a sample multimodal approach for breast cancer surgery. A preoperative regimen could consist of an antiepileptic medication, such as gabapentin or pregabalin, acetaminophen, and regional anesthesia. Preemptive analgesia ensures that the medication given is active before and during surgery. This also may decrease afferent transmission of pain signals and decrease acute postoperative pain. Several studies have shown opioid reduction and decreased acute and chronic pain using preemptive antiepileptics such as gabapentin or pregabalin. Regional anesthesia for breast cancer surgery could be either paravertebral blocks, pec blocks, or a thoracic epidural injection. These blocks can be either a single-shot block or a continuous infusion via catheter. Several studies have shown decreased postoperative pain when these regional techniques are used for breast surgery. If a transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) or deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is performed, the use of transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) has also been shown to decrease postoperative opioid use and pain scores. Intraoperatively, pain control should consist of zero to minimal short-acting opioids and a redose of acetaminophen if adequate time has passed. If the patient didn’t receive preoperative regional anesthesia, then the surgeon should perform infiltration with local anesthetics. This can be liposomal bupivacaine, bupivacaine, or ropivacaine, or placement of a continuous wound infiltration catheter. The local anesthetic of choice for infiltration should be the one that provides the longest duration of action in order to provide maximal patient benefit. Liposomal bupivacaine, given via single-shot infiltration, may provide more prolonged or extended analgesia postoperatively than standard local anesthetics. Recent data have shown liposomal bupivacaine given via infiltration to be an effective adjunct for postoperative pain control in breast augmentation and reduction. In addition, continuous peripheral or wound catheters can provide several days of pain relief using a continuous infusion of local anesthetic. The postoperative pain regimen should consist of scheduled acetaminophen, scheduled antiepileptics, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as soon as allowed, and intermittent short-acting opioids. This postoperative regimen should be continued for up to 1 week after surgery. In addition, complementary therapies such as acupuncture, aromatherapy, and healing touch can be offered to the patient. If a continuous catheter is in place, the infusion should consist of, at minimum, a local anesthetic and should be used in the acute postoperative period. In addition to the medications listed in the preceding paragraphs and the Table, several other classes of medications can also be used pending patient selection. Intravenous lidocaine has been used to decrease acute postsurgical pain in many surgical populations. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists such as ketamine and magnesium may play a role in central sensitization. The alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine have been used in multimodal approaches in other surgical procedures with success, as they primarily act at the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. Finally, glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone have been used to minimize inflammation and postoperative pain. A comprehensive multimodal pain regimen will provide the patient with the most complete pain control. It will minimize opioids, which not only will minimize opioid-related AEs and opioid misuse, but may decrease cancer recurrence. A retrospective study by Exadaktylos et al showed that paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia decreased breast cancer recurrence rates. Prospective studies have shown that paravertebral anesthetics, as opposed to general anesthetic with opioids and inhalation anesthetics, resulted in increased natural killer cell cytotoxicity as well as increased apoptosis in estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer cells. In conclusion, this review of a multimodal approach to acute postsurgical pain can provide a framework for managing patients’ pain after breast cancer surgery. This could be used alone or in combination with an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol to improve patients’ postsurgical outcomes. However, future prospective randomized studies are needed to determine the exact combinations and dosages of multimodal medications to provide the optimal benefit for patients.

1070,66,8,2,6,2015,2015-06-02,"This is very exciting and long awaited news. I have seen too many people who have exhausted all their options, and who were physically eligible for a new, targeted treatment, only to be turned down because it has not been approved for metastatic use or they are excluded because of all their previous therapies. When you have no more choices, access to potentially life extending drugs is your only hope. Finally, ASCO understands this and five pharmaceutical companies are on board. This is a major breakthrough for advanced disease patients. All solid tumor and blood cancer patients are included. I have had friends with advanced lung and breast cancer beg for compassionate access only to be denied because of red tape. This trial will change that. Bravo ASCO and thank you. ASCO Launches First-ever Clinical Trial: Aims to Learn from Patients with Advanced Cancer Who Lack Standard Treatment Options Five Leading Pharmaceutical Companies Will Support Innovative Study, Contribute Drugs CHICAGO – The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) today announced its first-ever clinical trial that will offer patients with advanced cancer access to molecularly-targeted cancer drugs and collect “real-world” data on clinical outcomes to help learn the best uses of these drugs outside of indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Plans for the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) study, including the participation of major pharmaceutical companies that will contribute free drugs, were released in a news briefing at the Society’s 2015 Annual Meeting in Chicago. The ASCO-sponsored prospective, non-randomized clinical trial will collect information on the anti-tumor activity and toxicity of commercially available, targeted cancer drugs in a range of cancer types, including any advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a genomic variation known to be a drug target. “Oncologists often use therapies approved for a specific cancer indication to treat people with other types of advanced cancer, but we very rarely learn from that experience to benefit other patients,” said ASCO President Peter Paul Yu, MD, FACP, FASCO. “TAPUR will document the real-world experience of patients who receive commercially available targeted anti-cancer drugs and will describe the effectiveness and side effects of a range of targeted agents available in this study.” ASCO will organize the operational aspects of the study, including the participation of multiple collaborators that are central to TAPUR’s success. TAPUR will involve not only patients and physicians, but also ASCO oversight committees, pharmaceutical companies, technology firms, and community-based study sites—representing a uniquely innovative and inclusive approach to studying the use of molecularly-targeted cancer drugs. “We are leveraging ASCO’s unique ability to bring together a diverse group of collaborators to undertake something that’s never been done before, all while simplifying access to multiple cancer treatments across many tumor types,” said ASCO Chief Medical Officer Richard L. Schilsky, MD, FASCO. “Perhaps even more importantly, TAPUR will involve community-based research programs, where the majority of cancer patients receive treatment and will provide education and support to community oncologists to help them interpret complex genomic tests.” TAPUR Next Steps In the coming months, an Institutional Review Board will review the study protocol and consent form. In addition, ASCO has established three oversight committees—each of which will include patient representatives, clinical oncologists, statisticians, and genomics specialists: • Steering Committee to oversee study operations, establish data sharing and publication policies, review plans to add or remove drugs from the study, and approve participation of clinical study sites; • Molecular Tumor Board to review the proposed drug-target match and suggest therapies on or off the study; • Data and Safety Monitoring Board to regularly review study results to ensure that severe or unexpected adverse events are carefully monitored, to determine when enrollment of study cohorts should expand or cease, and to determine when to release data and to which parties. Patient Participation TAPUR is designed to include a broader patient population than is typically enrolled in clinical trials. It will accept patients who have any advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma, or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and are no longer responding to standard anti-cancer treatment or for whom no acceptable treatment is available. Patients will be screened to determine if they are healthy enough to participate based on broad inclusion/exclusion criteria. If and when a patient meets the defined trial criteria, his or her treating physician will select a drug from among those available in the TAPUR study protocol that targets the identified genomic variation in the patient’s tumor. If a relevant drug-target match is not described in the protocol, a physician may consult the Molecular Tumor Board which will review the clinical and genomic features of the case and suggest potential therapies on or off the study. All patients who receive treatment through TAPUR will be monitored for standard toxicity and efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as duration of treatment. Patients participating in TAPUR will receive the anti-cancer drugs at no charge. It is expected that routine clinical care costs will be covered by the patient’s insurance plan. Participating Organizations ASCO has invited a number of pharmaceutical companies to provide marketed, targeted drugs and additional resources to support the development of the new study’s infrastructure. At the time of this announcement, ASCO reported that the following companies have signed memoranda of understanding agreeing to participate in the TAPUR study: • AstraZeneca • Bristol-Myers Squibb • Eli Lilly and Company • Genentech • Pfizer “At least 13 drugs that target more than 15 unique genomic variants will be provided by these companies. We are extremely grateful for the generosity of these companies without whose support TAPUR would not be possible,” said ASCO President Dr. Yu. “We anticipate additional companies will sign on, and are extremely encouraged with the level of interest we have received so far.” ASCO will launch the TAPUR study at clinical sites that comprise the Michigan Cancer Research Consortium, the Cancer Research Consortium of West Michigan, and the Carolinas Healthcare System—existing research networks that run research trials for the National Cancer Institute and industry—with the ultimate goal of expanding nationally. Two technology companies will provide key support to manage, analyze, and interpret the study data: Syapse will provide its Syapse Precision Medicine Platform to automate the study workflow and the Molecular Tumor Board process, and capture structured data from participating practices. Illumina will provide its NextBio knowledge base platform to support and inform the case review by the Molecular Tumor Board, as well as to support analysis of the TAPUR data by the study team. Finally, the Society will collaborate and share data with the Netherlands Center for Personalized Cancer Treatment, which is conducting a clinical trial using a study protocol very similar to TAPUR. “We are very fortunate that this leading cancer center has the same focus as TAPUR,” said Dr. Schilsky. “Technological advancements will allow us to pool our information in a seamless fashion and give us the ability to learn from the experience of a larger group of patients.” Patient Advocates to Play Key Role in TAPUR Patient advocates will play a central role throughout the study, providing guidance and oversight support. Jane Perlmutter, PhD, a cancer survivor and nationally recognized patient advocate, is lending her expertise in trial development and will help coordinate patient advocate recruitment and training for the study. “TAPUR has enormous potential to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of currently available therapies in treating cancers with genomic variations and to learn from patients who are treated with off-label drugs,” said Dr. Perlmutter. “I applaud ASCO for undertaking this important study and believe its findings will improve cancer care, especially for those with advanced cancer for whom traditional therapies are no longer working.” For more information about TAPUR, please go to http://www.asco.org/TAPUR.",0,1,0.11821338383838384
1071,66,9,1,6,2015,2015-06-01,"Promising clinical trial results presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2015 show activity of the investigational anti-cancer agent ONT-380 against HER2+ breast cancer, in one case specifically against brain metastases and in another case in overall survival of heavily pretreated HER2+ breast cancer patients. ""I am thrilled to have been able to offer this therapy to a patient in her early 40s. She didn't have any other great treatment options that we would have expected to have any meaningful impact, especially on her brain. Now she's been on the study over a year. The mets in her body are gone and the brain lesion has shrunk down to a little nubbin. She's living a normal life, fretting about the family business and how the kids are doing -- normal stuff,"" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center and one of the study's authors. Both sets of results being presented are from ongoing phase 1b clinical trials of ONT-380, one in combination with the drug TDM-1, and the other in combination with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab. Women on these studies include those whose disease had progressed after at least two previous rounds of therapy (sometimes including previous drugs used to target HER2). In the first study of ONT-380 with TDM-1, all 8 evaluable patients experienced more than 50 percent reduction in primary brain tumor size. ""This drug has the potential to be the long-awaited, needed therapy that targets brain metastases in HER2+ brain cancer, and could even someday be used to prevent brain metastases in the first place,"" says Borges. The second study presents overall response rates from a similar, ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of ONT-380 with capecitabine and/or trastuzumab. Of 8 heavily pretreated patients enrolled on the study, 4 showed partial response (reduction in tumor size of more than 30 percent), 2 achieved stable disease, and 2 progressed. In about 25 percent of the 1-in-8 women who will develop breast cancer during their lifetimes, the HER2 gene creates an abnormal amount of HER2 protein, which acts as a ""receptor"" for human epidermal growth factor. The presence of more HER2 receptors allows a cell to trap more growth-promoting hormones, which tells the cell to grow in an out-of-control, cancerous way. ONT-380, invented by Array Biopharma in Boulder, CO and now being developed by Oncothyreon in Seattle, WA, is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 ""tyrosine kinase"" -- a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain. ""Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,"" Borges says. University of Colorado Cancer Center.

You became that symbol of a champion as a cancer survivor who not only beat cancer, but rose again as a champion in sports and life. My friends donned your yellow bracelets in support to remind me that I, too, could beat cancer and rise again. Whether you wanted to or not, you became the positive role model I so desperately needed to wage the war of my life. When rumors swirled about doping, I defended you. I would remind people that a stage 4 cancer survivor would not take drugs known to cause cancer. I debated fiercely with my friends that someone guilty of such allegations could not possibly pass hundreds of tests and have the audacity to sue or threaten people who claimed he played dirty. Many are upset that you lied to your sport. I'm upset that you lied to me. The example you tried to project told me that your body was an incredible machine that could beat cancer and you were stronger for the fight. It was all a lie. You weren't stronger or healthier. You didn't triumph by determination and strength. You took the coward's path. You cheated. You broke my heart, or so I thought. As I took your picture down from my wall I realized there is something for which I can thank you. You made me realize that I didn't need an example of what appeared to be super-human strength. The real truth is that within me, and others facing cancer, is champion enough - a champion who faced the raw truth of cancer and is truly stronger for having done so.

1121,69,10,8,10,2009,2009-10-08,"Living through a breast cancer diagnosis or two truly helps you understand people and how they react to certain situations. I have learned so much about people from the faithful friends and family members who won't leave your side to the scared friends who hide from cancer and you in the process. It seems the ones who have had the toughest time addressing me or breast cancer have been the men in my life. First, the issue is intimate, scary, and emotional. All things that some men have a difficult time addressing. Of all the resources available about breast cancer, few address the needs of the men supporting women with this diagnosis. Luckily, that has changed. STAND BY HER: A Breast Cancer Guide for Men by John W. Anderson (AMACOM Books, October 2009) is an excellent resource for any man who needs help in overcoming the fears and frustrations of seeing loved ones diagnosed with breast cancer. Not only does he share his own experiences with his mother, his mother's friend, his aunt, and his wife, he also provides strategies and support for navigating the breast cancer minefield. I don't normally endorse products on my blog, but this is a great resource. Let's speak honestly here. Breast cancer treatment is so very tough for women, especially emotionally. A very large component of treatment involves serious hormone manipulation and often times physical changes. And frankly, if men were wired to be able to handle emotions and hormones, well, how do I finish that? It is an area where men and women are wired very differently leaving it difficult for men to understand how to offer the support a woman needs as she battles breast cancer. Don't get me wrong, some men handle all this like amazing champs, but everyone involved in a cancer diagnosis could use all the support available and then some. Yes, I recommend this book, but I am not alone. This book is also endorsed by the Komen for the Cure Foundation. I like John W. Anderson. He has seen far more than his share of breast cancer in his lifetime, but he has used that painful experience to help others. Our caretakers are truly our heroes and John demonstrates this expertly in his book. I want to share the love. In honor of breast cancer awareness month, I have a few copies of this book. Leave a message or drop me an email (link at the left) and I will send you a copy. No charge. Really. I'd like to get as many copies of this book into the hands of people that need it. But hurry; once they are gone you will have to find it on your own. The more advanced we become with treatment and as the survival statistics rise, please know that women make it look easier and easier to fight breast cancer. Don't let us fool you. For many us, it will be the hardest thing we ever do. Anything anyone does to help ease the burden is never forgotten. So who wants a book? Don't be shy. Drop me a line already.

1122,69,2,1,7,2010,2010-07-01,"Each year, on this day, it has been hard not to look back and think about the day as it unfolded six years ago. Each broad-ranging emotion, each action, each word as it was said to me, the look on each person’s face as I told them of my diagnosis. At times those memories sting with the poignancy of the moment as though it happened seconds ago. This year, only one year out of treatment from the recurrence, I find myself facing the day differently. As 2009 came to a close, I dedicated 2010 to a new start. I needed to put the cancer in its appropriate place in my life – in the past. So I set off on a journey. I had physical side effects that were lingering from treatment and side effects from the hormone-suppressing medication I would be taking for five years. I was trying to heal, physically, emotionally, and spiritually and it led me on a wonderful path of mind body wellness and healing. I began to explore Reiki, yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, and it was all so much to absorb and understand what I needed in my life and how to incorporate as lasting changes. I spent a weekend at the Chopra Center to pull the pieces together and instead it changed my perceptions again. I learned that meditation isn’t a nice thing to do from time to time, but is the foundation for mind body wellness. I learned that before I could ever begin to heal my body, I had to heal my heart. I had to let go of the pain and the feelings of failure as result of my diagnosis both times. I learned that instead of defensively closing my heart to protect it, I needed to open it to accept love and healing. And the rest would flow, with work, commitment to wellness, and the grace of God it would flow. And it has… After two months of primordial sound meditation, I am already seeing improvements in feeling a bit more centered, a reduction to my slightly high heart rate, and general well being. I try to always choose colorful, healthy, fresh meals in Ayurvedic tradition. I rededicated myself to a fitness program that seems to be effective so far. My lymphedema issues have stabilized a bit for now. All positive. All moving forward. All blessings for body, mind, and spirit. Looking back, I am reminded of the beautiful words of Hafiz: The earth has disappeared beneath my feet, Illusion fled from all my ecstasy. Now like a radiant sky creature God keeps opening. God keeps opening Inside of Me. --Hafiz In the beginning of this cancer journey, I refused to believe that I was so shallow that lowly cancer would change me. I was determined to disassociate myself with the people claiming that cancer changed their lives in positive ways. Cancer wasn't the catalyst for positive change. Cancer removed my illusions about life and in doing so allowed me to be more aware of the delicate nature of life. It has allowed me to recognize the abundant joys of life on a very different level than ever before. The adundant joys, however, came from somewhere far, far, far from ugly, destructive cancer. The memories of this anniversary may always be bitter sweet, but I have a most grateful heart today. What more could I ask?

So many times I have started to write and as I write I get this odd feeling that I am either sounding a) whiny about the little things when really I should be grateful to be alive or b) a little full of myself regarding the things I find important as a survivor. Meh, all bloggers are a little whiny and arrogant, no? On with life as a survivor…. This year is going by at lightening speed. Seriously. Where did the first four months go? I started the year teaching three classes in addition to my regular job. I’m not sure exactly what I was thinking with this schedule, but you can do anything for ten weeks, right? But I also fit time in for a new passion: boxing. I have been working out a boxing gym. Love it! When I am in the ring, I feel incredibly strong. I literally have my Rocky moment! And then my trainer gets in the ring and I feel like a breathless, weak, wimp. But what a great work out! The best part of being a survivor, is that the debates with the insurance company keep popping up (you feel the sarcasm, right?). Nothing like needing a service and having to wait six months to get it. I have been having lymphedema issues in my arm and back. I have been trying yoga lymph drainage massage while waiting for the physical therapy to be approved. I flew across country last week and wore my sleeve, but that didn’t stop my back from swelling (looks lack back fat on one side…sexy, no?). Hopefully the physical therapy will kick in next week. My oncologist also mentioned that recent studies are showing a 30% reduction in swelling with acupuncture. I am hoping that as soon as this study is published and the fields are identified I can start some acupuncture too. I am paying attention to all of my New Year’s resolutions and this is a record for me. Honesty to be starting the fifth month of the year and still have those resolutions in sight is a personal best. In fact, this weekend is THE weekend I have been waiting for all year. I will be enjoying yoga, meditation, and natural healing with, wait for it…I’m about to name drop….here it is…Deepak Chopra. Not only Deepak, but Erin, my long time bloggy friend and sweet wonderful healer, is joining me. We finally get to hang out in person. How cool is that?

1124,69,4,6,1,2010,2010-01-06,"Welcome 2010. This year so far promises to bring new dventures, new hope, new beginnings, and new energy. I am filled with more hope than ever before about the future. My goal is to become physically and mentally stronger which will not only help in my ongoing quest to fight cancer, but it will enhance my overall health and happiness. 2009 was a tough and wacky year that brought me great personal strength and sent me down a new path that involves natural healing. I find myself at the dawn of 2010 feeling inspired to forge ahead on this path. I started on this journey when I was frustrated how I felt physically after chemo and radiation last year. I arm was aching, I lost range of motion in my shoulder, and lymphadema (the swelling in my arm)was rearing its ugly head (or should I say ugly big fat arm). My physical therapist explained that the main lymphatic vessel is between the lungs and the diaphragm and when we practice deep, breathing (into the diaphragm) we exercise the main lymphatic vessel (from memory here; she talked to me about this while bending my arm in a pretzel). She mentioned that there is some research that supports these deep breathing exercises to help with lymphadema. If nothing else it also helped with relaxation (when you can't sleep because you aren't comfortable because your arm and shoulder hurt). And about the time I was in physical therapy, a friend offered to send me healing energy (Reiki). I trusted her (still do!) and decided that it couldn't hurt me. I experienced something in the first session that was amazing. The combination of that and physical therapy really helped me with my shoulder and arm issues. About this time, one of my medications (hormone therapy) was causing this itchy, ugly, scabby rash on my hands (pretty and so sexy). My doctor suggested a topical steroid, but since the natural approach was really working for me, my cousin suggested I visit a natural healer and have him do some ""vial"" work on me. I wasn't sure what that was, but once again, it couldn't hurt. Within two weeks after seeing him my hands cleared up (except for some scars, but I'm workiing on that!). The natural healilng engine was really picking up speed for me. Time spent each day doing deep breathing evolved into meditation (a twofer! so efficient). My natural curiosity led me to research meditation which led me to Deepak Chopra and Primordial Sound Meditation. And that led me to yoga and Ayurveda. And now it is 2010 and I feel great. I am full of energy and hope and a desire to be healthy. I haven't made any resolutions, but I have made promises to myself. If I can make myself healthy, happy, and whole, it will not only bring me peace, but bring peace to those around me. Understanding and embracing the whole mind body connection is the key for me this year. With that in mind, I have promised myself the following: 1. Meditate daily. 2. Practice yoga. 3. Focus on a natural diet (Ayurveda). 4. Physical exercise daily. 5. Learn and practice Reiki. Welcome 2010! So glad you are here.

1126,69,6,16,12,2009,2009-12-16,"When I was young, I remember reading The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. I remembered the story as a poignant story about being willing to give whatever you have to benefit those whom you love. Rereading the story as an adult, I am not so sure I would interpret it the same way; however, I reconnected with the story when a dear friend had a tree planted in honor of my mother. When my mother passed away, my friend asked if she could have a tree planted in a local park in honor of my mother. It took me a few months to be able to go forward with it emotionally, but in fall 2008, a beautiful tree was planted in a very sweet neighborhood park. When my mom first moved to California she immediately wrote to her family telling them of the purple trees in California. It seemed only appropriate to request a Jacaranda tree with its lovely purple blossoms. My sisters and I have enjoyed picnics by the tree and we have visited the tree on occasions even sneaking my doggies in for a visit at a park that doesn't allow dogs (what park does not allow dogs?). Since the park is so close to my office, I frequently go there on my lunch hour and check on the tree. I feel close to mom there. It feels good to be there. I have watched the tree grow over the last year or so. It is a beautiful little tree with five strong branches, one for each daughter. It will grow to provide shade for the children who play in the park, it will provide a beautiful burst of purple color in the late spring and summer when it blooms, and it will watch over the weddings and birthday parties and other special events that frequently happen in the park. It is in fact a giving tree, much like my mom who gave everything she had for those she loved. On November 30, her birthday, I went by for a visit. Much to my surprise there was a beautiful blossom at the very top. Strange because Jacarandas bloom around June. You can't really see it too well on the photo from my phone's camera (try clicking it to see it larger), but it was such a special and sweet gift to see such life and color crowning the tree on her birthday.

1127,69,7,4,12,2009,2009-12-04,"Life as a survivor has had its challenges. After my first diagnosis, I lived in fear of recurrence. In some ways I felt like I had to go out and do a lot of things in case there was a recurrence and I wouldn't have a chance. Although saying it, it sounds like I went traveling, and sky diving, and other fabulous things. Not so much. I took on challenging projects and got involved in events that have some social benefit (Race for the Cure, Relay for Life, etc.). I tried to give to the greater good thinking in some tangled way that karma would protect me from a recurrence. If you have been reading along in the last year, you now that is not exactly how the story went. Somehow, through powers greater than myself, I was empowered during the second trip down the cancer journey. I powered (literally) through treatment and have been working on creating the life I want without cancer. I know that cancer will always be a part of my life, but I realized that it doesn't have to be a part of my present or future. Cancer is part of past. This time around I am respectfully putting cancer in its rightful place and moving forward fearlessly. I determined I have two choices: I can live in fear of recurrence or I can live having faith in my healing. If I can believe 100% in my healing, the fear has no place in my life. I can be afraid that the cancer will come back, or I can live and embrace the life I do have. I thought this would be easier said than done, but really the opposite is so much harder. Living in fear is hard. It is burdensome. It robs the joy from even the simplest of pleasures. It permeates every fiber of your being and follows you like a shadow. Shedding fear takes a leap of faith: faith in your God (however you describe or call God), faith in yourself, faith in the Universe. Honestly, though, what is there to lose? I can continue to walk carrying a heavy burden or I can simply put it down and move forward without restriction. Once you leap into fearlessness a whole new world opens before you. It's brighter -- literally there is more light and more color. You can recognize all the love and positive energy around you. You start to attract people who feel the same energy you feel. The difference is amazing. I welcome the close of a very difficult year and the beginning of a fearless future. Who is with me? Labels: moving on after cancer",0,1,0.15821587972750767

1196,9,1,11,2,2011,2011-02-11,"Yesterday was a first for me--I used my identity as a ""cancer"" patient (or former cancer patient or cancer survivor--so hard to know which phrase is most apropos for me) to illustrate a point I was making in my Asian American lit and theory course. Right now we're reading NYU Law School professor Kenji Yoshino's Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights (click here for the link to the book's website). One of my students asked for a clarification of the key concept of Yoshino's book, namely how covering differs from passing. Now, I'm very comfortable with using myself or elements from my life, especially in terms of my ethnicity, race, and gender, to help illuminate aspects of what I'm teaching--particularly when it's in a class on Asian American subjects. So it wasn't unusual for me to draw from my personal identity to clarify a theoretical concept related to race or identitarian issues. But it was DEFINITELY a first for me to draw from my most recent experiences with cancer. And this is what I said. If, during the middle of my chemotherapy treatments--the period in which I clearly lost my hair due to this treatment--I wore a wig and found myself at a dinner party with a group of people and I never brought up my cancer diagnosis or on-going chemotherapy treatment--if, in fact, when complimented on my new hairstyle, if I simply said thank you or didn't elaborate on the fact that I was wearing a wig, then I would be passing--I would be deliberately hiding my cancer diagnosis and masking the visible effects of my cancer treatment. I would be ""passing"" as a healthy person rather than as a cancer patient. However, if I was open about my cancer diagnosis and my chemotherapy treatment, and the fact that I had lost my hair but then still wore a wig to this dinner party--either to not make others feel uncomfortable from the visible difference I present as a cancer patient or to make myself more comfortable to not be so visibly marked by my cancer--then I'd be ""covering""--there is no denial about the fact that I have cancer, but I would also not draw any attention to my status as a cancer patient. After I gave this example the students nodded their heads, and I moved on with the next phase of my lesson. But it was an odd feeling, realizing that I had just used my cancer as a way to illustrate an intellectual issue in the classroom--that I had so publicly performed my cancer identity for my students. Because what was odd wasn't the insertion of the personal with the professional--as I noted before, I've often used aspects of my identity in making or illustrating a point in the classroom. What was odd was realizing that I had integrated, seemingly seamlessly, the identity of a cancer patient/cancer survivor to the point where I COULD use it as an example in the classroom. Is this an intellectual leap, for me, to accept and recognize the place of cancer in my life--to my sense of self? Is it now a part of my indelible identity in the same way that I think of my gender and race and ethnicity as immutable (even while, of course, recognizing that intellectually I know that these are also social constructs--can I ever turn off the academic in me)? Will I now be the professor who performs her cancer in the classroom or is this a consequence of time--that this experience being so fresh for me becomes yet another recent experience for me to draw from?",0,1,0.0935849567099567
1199,9,12,2,1,2011,2011-01-02,"It's now the second day of the new year, 2011, and I typically don't do new year's resolutions (seems like a set up for failed expectations) but leaving behind one year for the next does seem to be a chance to look back and reflect, as well as to look ahead with hopes and aspirations. I know I haven't been writing much on this blog--truth be told, the last entry about why I chose not to do reconstruction seemed to be a place for me to pause in terms of my processing about cancer and chemo and surgery. Maybe I also needed a break from writing--which is funny since one could argue that all I've had since May 2010 is a break from writing and working (aside from blog writing that is, well, and some light editing and conference planning activity that I've been doing for the Association for Asian American Studies). When I think about 2010, the last year of the first decade of the 21st century, I realize that it will be marked by my illness and cancer--that I will have spent more days of that year living with the knowledge that I have/had cancer than days not knowing--or to put it another way, that most of 2010 was occupied with being in and out of various doctor's offices (or more accurately, waiting rooms). It'd be easy to say that 2010 was a horrible year and I'm glad it's over. But 2010 will also mark the year I turned 40, and most especially (and most significantly) the year I got married to Matthew. It will also mark the year I turned in my tenure file. And most recently, the year that Matthew and I expanded our family to include Bella--the newest addition to the Grady-Ho household: [We've been debating about a second dog for a while now, but after we returned from our pre-Christmas vacation to Charleston--we decided to look in earnest and we found her through a rescue organization that takes dogs from rural shelters and fosters them in Wake Forest. So far Bruno is tolerating (just barely) his more energetic younger sister--we're hoping that in time, they'll really grow closer] So there have been some important milestone and moments in 2010 that I'll look back on in fondness. And some of them, I must confess, have also been around my cancer diagnosis. Now, I still hold firm to the fact that if I had to do it over again, I would NEVER WANT TO HAVE CANCER OR GO THROUGH CHEMO AND SURGERY. But...I'd be lying if I didn't say that post-cancer diagnosis, I have been nearly overwhelmed and deeply moved by the love and kindness of people in my life. From near strangers to my oldest and closest family members, there have been random acts of kindness and love and support from people that have really humbled me. In particular, all the people who dropped off food--the food gifts were incredible and are most memorable, to me, as both a symbolic and material way for people to express their support/concern/affection. Of course, there are moments that I will never want to relive. That awful feeling in the pit of my stomach upon hearing the initial diagnosis. The worry and concern, the anxiety and fear I could see on people's faces or hear in their voices when I shared my diagnosis. The entire experience of chemotherapy and surgery. The realization that I would more than likely lose ovarian function and be unable to get pregnant. The loss of my hair (which is, thankfully, growing back very quickly). So 2010 was an awful year, health wise (and I should add, not just for myself but for my dear Aunt Teri-Ann and dear friend Jeff Cross--and there are other friends who have had health issues this year and who have had their own surgeries and experiences in doctors' waiting rooms & offices). Which means that in looking forward, what I most hope for 2011 is good health. For myself, for all my loved ones, for all of you. What 2011 will actually bring is anyone's guess. I will be back in the classroom on January 11--which makes it the first time in a year that I'll be teaching undergrads (I only taught a single grad seminar Spring 2010, so this is one of the longest absences I've had from teaching undergrads). I'm still working on my book manuscript on racial ambiguity (I have 40 very rough pages on Tiger Woods that I'm not proud of ... yet, and I need to work on a chapter about transracial/transnational adoptees). I'm the conference co-chair for the annual meeting of the Association for Asian American Studies (yep, I've been doing conference stuff for the last few months while recuperating from surgery). And then there's my tenure file...I still need to be observed in the classroom--and then my department will vote on me (in late February I believe) and then I await news from the college and provost committees (keep your fingers crossed ladies and gentlemen). I've got a lot on my plate professionally. Am I better? Yes. By which I mean, I've got my hair back (yay!), I'm no longer feeling so fatigued (although I still have bouts of exhaustion and my energy level is still not 100%--after walking Bella for 40 minutes the other day I came home and collapsed. Walking for 40 minutes should NOT drain me normally...I'm not sure how I'm going to train for this 4 mile race in April if this persists). I still have some tightness in my arms and chest post-surgery, but in general I have full range of motion. And most of all, psychologically and emotionally I feel strong. But I want to clarify one thing about that last statement. While I do feel like my cancer is in the past--part of the memories of 2010 I will carry with me, I don't feel like I'm necessarily ""over"" it--I don't necessarily know if I'll ever feel the way I did pre-April 2010, mentally and emotionally that is (well, even physically since there's no way to get my original breasts back or to take away these physical scars). I have been marked by this disease, for better or worse, and I will carry those psychic scars with me, just as I wear the physical scars. They are part of my life now, and I am learning to live with them. I'm not sure how much blogging I'll be doing in this space. I suspect that I'll still write posts from time to time. There is one about my gender identity, in particular, that I'd like to explore. But for those of you who were mostly checking in to see how I was doing, you probably won't be hearing much on the health front--you hopefully won't be hearing anything significant on the cancer or N.E.D. front EVER (that'd be wonderful, wouldn't it?). So this may be the last entry you decide to read, which is fine by me. I am grateful that people wanted to know what was going on with me and checked into the blog at all. So Happy New Year! Lets hope that 2011 is good to us all, body and soul. [Me & Bruno at Folly's Beach, SC -- see, my hair IS growing back!]",0,1,0.12478647718401813
1200,9,13,5,6,2011,2011-06-05,"About 3 months ago, I had an appointment with my Ob-Gyn. Now this may be TMI (isn't this whole blog TMI???) but the reason I went in was that my period had come back WITH A VENGANCE. I suppose after not having a period for nearly 9 months it's not unexpected to have the floodgates open, so to speak. But it freaked me out--especially because 9 months prior to my cancer diagnosis I had had surgery to remove some fibroids that had caused serious bleeding issues to the point where they had to infuse me with 3 bags of blood prior to my surgery to get my hematacrit & hemoglobin levels to the point where they could do surgery (yep, I was that bad off--if I was alive a century ago I'd be dead by now -- and not from the cancer but from the fibroids). Anyway, during the ultrasound of my uterus a spot was found on my ovaries. It could have been simply a residual spot from having recently had my period. Or it could be a benign cyst. Or a malignant tumor. When I met with my gynecologist, he wanted to see me in another month and repeat the ultrasound because given my recent cancer history, he thought it was better to be on the safe side. And the good news is that when they repeated the exam, the spot had disappeared. Was I worried? Not terribly. I suppose I figured the law of averages would kick in--like, I couldn't possibly be diagnosed with ovarian cancer less than a year after being diagnosed with breast cancer, right? And I tend not to worry until I need to worry--at least not consciously worry. But the truth is, I am afraid of recurrence. How could I not be? The tamoxifen treatment that I'm on has certain side effects and risks associated with it--namely the risk of developing a fatal type of uterine cancer. The percentage of women who develop this type of uterine cancer while on the tamoxifen treatment is very small--certainly statistically smaller than the advantages to being on tamoxifen for 5 years. So I take this daily pill and hope for the best. Yet it freaks me out to think that my body, in reaction to this hormone therapy that is supposed to prevent the original breast cancer tumor cells from spreading to other parts of my body may, in fact, be creating new types of cancer cells in my uterus. And when I say it freaks me out, it's not like I want to get a hysterectomy or that I worry about it every day. But when I read this report in The New York Times last night, I was first of all very glad to hear that tamoxifen and other treatments that they give to women after a breast cancer diagnosis are now being used to prevent breast cancer from every occurring--that these drugs are being used as a preventative, prophylactic measure. However, it was a jolt to read that among the serious side effects of tamoxifen are blood clots--and of course the National Cancer Institute has a Question & Answer page that lists, clearly, what the negative side effects are--and right there are blood clots, strokes, uterine cancer, and cataracts. How can I police my body for these issues? Should I wonder every time I feel a tingling in my arm? A cramp in my abdomen? A blurring in my eyes? I don't want to turn into a hypocondriac. And quite frankly, uterine cancer can be very hard to detect early since we don't have access to our uterus--I can't really see or feel it, except once a month, and then that's in the form of cramping--it's not like I can check around for a tumor by reaching inside my body and feeling around. I did get a baseline reading on my eyes from the wonderful folks at Carrboro Family Vision and the amazing Dr. Jason Chow. So far my eyes look like the eyes of a healthy 41 year old woman (meaning, I probably need bi-focals in 4 years, but that's part and parcel with aging). I guess I'm musing about these things because I think, in part, I have to live my life the way I lived my life prior to getting my cancer diagnosis--meaning, I can't worry about every little ache and pain. I can't worry about whether the cancer is going to come back on a daily basis. It might--and my follow-up appointments with my surgeon and oncologist and my regular physical with my primary care physician and appointments with my gynecologist, should be maintained to make sure that I'm doing OK. But I think I have to try to live with the fear of recurrence without letting that fear take over my life.",0,1,0.1109361471861472
1202,9,15,16,8,2012,2012-08-16,"Last week, on August 9, 2012, renowned humorist and This American Life contributor, David Rakoff died. He died, essentially, because a tumor had developed in his left shoulder--a cancerous tumor that was brought about by the radiation treatment he underwent in his 20s when he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. I was in the shower listening to NPR when they announced his death. And I cried. I didn't know David Rakoff personally, but I did feel like I ""knew"" him through his writing (he's the author of 3 books and a 4th that will be published posthumously). I also knew him through his radio pieces for This American Life--most recently a bit he did playing Dr Seuss. I admired his writing and his radio essays, but I cried because I was scared. For me. I had written previously about cancer making you selfish--or rather, making me selfish. I think this is sort've natural. I also don't want to paint myself into being a terrible monster. I am genuinely sad about Rakoff's passing. Just as I was genuinely sad when Elizabeth Edwards passed away a year and a half ago. Just as I was and still am genuinely sad over the death of my favorite aunt from leukemia. But I am also scared. Not in a way where I am paralyzed or I think about my mortality constantly. But I definitely know that hearing about David Rakoff's cancer coming back a second time and then hearing the news about his death makes me feel scared. It makes me wonder if that's going to happen to me. My fear doesn't last very long--enough to cry in the shower mourning David Rakoff and feeling anxious about my future. And then I dry myself off and go about my day. But I wanted to write about fear because I think it's something we have a hard time acknowledging--those of us who have a cancer diagnosis or who have a loved one with a cancer diagnosis. And recently I was reminded about the need we have to keep positive while reading this piece in the New York Times, part of their ""Life, Interrupted"" series which chronicles the thoughts and feeling of Suleika Jaouad. Quoting Barbara Ehrenreich's critique of the bright-siding of cancer, Jaouad, after admitting that she has tried to keep a positive attitude towards everything she has been dealing with related to her cancer, writes: At what point is positivity a form of denial? Does positivity at all costs have a cost? I’m not a negative person, and I’m certainly not trying to set up a school for negative thinking, but today I’m giving myself permission to step out of the spin zone of positivity — to stare down fear, anxiety and dread without the guilt that I might be giving up or not fighting hard enough. And reading her essay reminded me of what I had forgotten because I am no longer living with it on a daily basis: Cancer is hard. It's not about being positive or negative. It's about cancer being a difficult disease to navigate. And it's difficult on so many levels--because chemotherapy is horrible and the side effects can be crippling. But most of all, because it's scary. It's scary to think that you are putting your body through all of these treatments--of getting poked and prodded and having parts of yourself cut open and cut off. And we do this because we want to have the best outcome possible--we want the cancer to go away, and we want to live. So it's sad and scary to hear about people who did all these things, like David Rakoff, and who, none-the-less, dies from cancer related complications. Not a cherry post, I know. But I think it's OK to admit that I'm scared. Just a little bit. I think it's important, in fact, to acknowledge that I went through something horribly difficult and life altering. And that the scars that I wear are not simply on my chest.",0,-1,-0.07328939275660586

1206,9,19,7,12,2010,2010-12-07,"Today Elizabeth Edwards died from metastatic breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 2004, the day after John Kerry & John Edwards failed to win the 2004 Presidential election. The tumor (which she discovered herself) was the size of a half dollar. It was detected early and the prognosis was good because it had not spread to her body but was contained to her breast. She did a lumpectomy, along with chemotherapy and radiation. In 2006, over a year after her diagnosis, her oncologist said, ""that I had a lot going on in my life . . . but cancer was not one of them"" (taken from The Daily Kos). Then in March 2007, Edwards discovered that her cancer had spread to her ribs, hip, and possibly her lungs. Her oncologist, Dr. Lisa Carey, confirmed that there was no cure for her cancer but that it could be treated and she could live a very full life for the next few years. But that her cancer was terminal. (Here is the link with the original press conference that the Edwards' did at UNC Chapel Hill: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/us/08edwards.html?hp). When I heard that Elizabeth Edwards had passed away this evening I cried. I'd like to be able to tell you that it was purely out of empathy and sympathy -- that my tears were for her young children, as well as her older daughter, her extended family and friends, and even for her estranged husband. But I cried not only in sadness for another woman felled by cancer, but because this particular woman, who lived in Chapel Hill, who had the same disease I have, who shared the same oncologist that I have (yes, Dr. Lisa Carey, is also my oncologist), and who had a similar prognosis, initially, to my prognosis--could be me. There is a 14% chance that what happened to Elizabeth Edwards will happen to me. There is a 14% chance that I will be going to see my oncologist for a follow-up appointment 2 years from now and she will be concerned about a symptom that I am exhibiting and in follow-up tests will tell me that the cancer has returned and it is in my bones or a major organ. There is a 14% chance that just like Elizabeth Edwards, I will be living with stage IV metastatic cancer, trying to figure out how to live with a diagnosis of terminal cancer--how to live with the certain knowledge that my natural life span will be drastically cut short. And there is a 14% chance that like Elizabeth Edwards I will not be here in six years. That I will die from the cancer in my body. I'm scared. Not to the point where I feel paralyzed. And not to the point where I am going to spiral into depression. But in the here and now--on the night that Elizabeth Edwards has died, I'm scared. And I cried not only because a very public woman who had breast cancer died, a woman who lived less than 10 miles down the road from me, but because when I heard that Elizabeth Edwards had died today, I realized that that could be me. We have the same disease with a similar prognosis, were treated in the same facility by the same oncologist. How could I not feel freaked out and wonder if that will be me one day? Which is why I can't say I'm a survivor. I know I've written about this in past posts, but I think Edwards death reminds me that I live with a certain amount of uncertainty. I want to be part of that 86%. I live every day with most of me believing that I will be part of that 86%. But then there are days, like today, where a shadow is cast, and I am reminded that there are the 14% of people who don't survive this disease. The last thing I'll say, though, is that as selfish as part of my tears were, I do mourn Elizabeth Edwards death. Because I think a lot of what she said and did regarding her cancer diagnosis was exemplary and provide me with a model for how I want to approach my own future. In countless interviews after her 2007 cancer relapse, she reiterated that everybody has to die; in her case, she now knows what she's going to die from. She also said that what she wants to show people isn't a woman dying from cancer but a person living with cancer. And that this is the biggest message she has for people with cancer--not to focus on the dying but on the living. And so in honor of Elizabeth Edwards, I'm going to focus on living my life as well as I can. I hope you will too.",0,1,0.09921672998203608
1207,9,2,14,1,2011,2011-01-14,"OK, here's a truth. I'm tired. I don't know if I'm more or less tired than I was during chemo and post-surgery. Probably less tired. At least physically it's easier for me to move around. But I *feel* fatigued. On many levels. I think I've downplayed my exhaustion for a few reasons. Primarily I think that I have a hard time accepting that being tired and not having a lot of energy or energy in reserve, which I think is the more accurate description for my condition right now, is part of my new reality. And I think I've been reluctant to accept this because I have been concentrating on being BETTER--on healing and resuming my regular routine and a sense of normalcy. But the truth is, I'm tired a lot. I just don't have the energy that I used to have. And what I mean by this is my life pre-chemo/surgery. My life pre-cancer diagnosis. And my fatigue and exhaustion aren't just physical--it's also mental and emotional. It's a new inability to handle stress in the same way. And a recognition that I need to be as gentle with myself as possible. To really cut myself slack. To not demand too much of myself. In short, I need to learn my limits--my physical limits but also my mental/emotional limits. And this is a hard thing for me to do. I'm normally a very high energy person. And I'm a multitasker who is a perfectionist and who burns the candles at both ends (and sometimes in the middle). I have extraordinarily high (overly high) expectations for myself (and for those close to me, unfortunate at times, I realize) and in general I feel like I should deliver on those expectations. But I can't right now. Pushing myself, something I'm used to doing, is just not an option. I don't have it in me. Case in point: after teaching back-to-back classes yesterday, I canceled my office hours and collapsed on the couch at home, pretty much not getting up until I collapsed in bed (where I promptly fell asleep the minute my head touched my pillow). Normally teaching back-to-back classes and holding office hours would leave me tired, but not ""bone-dead-I'm-going-to-pass-out"" tired. This is my new reality. And it reminds me that teaching takes energy. Emotional and mental energy, in addition to physical energy. I think I forget this because I enjoy teaching and because I've been doing it for so long now that it almost seems like it is second nature to me. But it's work--it takes work to be a good teacher. And I'm not sure how organized or coherent or lively I was yesterday. I know I forgot to share some basic information with my students about their assignments--leading me to follow-up on email. I know that I felt scattered and a bit dis-organized during the first hour of teaching, perhaps a consequence of being out of the classroom for so long. And I know that I was surprised by all of this. Which I shouldn't be. I shouldn't be surprised that teaching is going to be different for me this semester. That my body is different. I am different. And I should be gentle with myself. To not demand too much of myself, especially in these first few weeks back in the classroom. And yet...I'm disappointed. Disappointed in my body for not having more energy. In myself for not being more organized and accomplishing more. Disappointed that I am still healing--that I'm not healed (past tense). It's silly, I know. Healing is something that can't be rushed. And I know that if I were someone else, I would tell me to be more patient and to be gentle and that what I went through was a big deal and I have to learn to limit myself and it's not a failing or an indictment on my character or sense of self. Why do we often become our hardest critics? And is this just because I'm an academic who deconstructs and critiques others for a living? (sigh) Maybe I just need a mantra to get through the next few weeks and months. Be gentle Jen...be gentle Jen. Hopefully I can learn to take my own advice. [Update/Aside: If you saw the post below, you'll see that Matthew and I adopted a new dog, Bella. Unfortunately, we had to return her to her foster mother last week Monday when we realized that Bella had some very aggressive tendencies. Specifically, she tried to attack Bruno 3 times and was also aggressive with our friend's dog, Squirrel. It was a hard decision, but at the end of the day, we feel we made the right choice because we couldn't live with the tension and with the uncertainty of her attacking Bruno. And it's also part of learning my own limits--it wasn't the right time to get another dog because teaching is just about all I can handle right now.]",0,1,0.035263779176150305
1208,9,20,1,1,2013,2013-01-01,"So this seems about par for the course--a new blog post every 3-4 months. Of course I had often thought about writing and posting in this space. I'm never sure if there's anyone still reading this blog, but I thought that it's still useful to have it up for the older posts, the ones that are happening in ""real time"" in terms of my initial breast cancer diagnosis, treatment decisions, chemo, surgery, and recovery. If you want to read any of those posts, you can look on the right and see the key blog posts I've highlighted that gives you a sense of my story so far. But this is a new year. Specifically, it's the first day of 2013. The doomsday folks who misread the Mayan calendar were wrong--life didn't end on 12/12/12. We also managed to avoid going over a fiscal cliff (well, perhaps--the House still has to approve the deal). We are all still alive. Although I suppose this is a point where I could wax on in philosophical fashion about how much longer I or anyone else has on this planet. For better or worse, what my cancer diagnosis and everything that followed from it has meant is that I'm more aware of my mortality--more aware that I am alive, for now, but whether it will be the recurrence of my cancer, a new cancer (tamoxifen makes me at risk for uterine cancer, and the chemo made me at risk for ovarian cancer) or just the vagaries of life (random acts of violence, accidents, illnesses--wow, this is turning into a rather somber new year's blog post). Yet that's not what I want to write about, not today. What I want to write about, the ""looking back"" part, is a post I've said I was going to write for over two years: What it's like not to have breasts. [Aside: for anyone new to this blog, I had bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery in mid-October, 2010 without reconstructive surgery. For more on my reasons not to do reconstruction, click here for this older blog post] I must say that the answer I would have given you in January 2011 would be different than January 2012 and now, January 2013. In the weeks and months after my bi-lateral mastectomy surgery, I was very low. Perhaps not a full throttled depression, but there were so many things to juggle, mentally and emotionally, related to my breast cancer and related to my life in general. The first time I took a shower after I was out of the hospital, I just sobbed. I cried every time I took a shower and had to change and saw the bandages, the drains, the empty space where my breasts had been. And the first time that Matthew and I had sex, I sobbed, and he just held me and told me it was going to be OK. That's been the hardest part. Perhaps that's an overly intimate thing to share, but it's true--it's what I had suspected all along when I was trying to decide whether to do the mastectomy surgery or just the lumpectomy with follow-up radiation. I knew that losing my breasts meant losing sexual pleasure. And while I could have had replacement breasts that would ""look"" like my old breasts (or newer, better breasts), the sexual stimulation and pleasure would be gone (you can't have nipple stimulation with a fake nipple and silicon breasts). And there's the clothing issue. I gave away several dresses and blouses that really didn't fit anymore--that didn't look good without my breasts--or because I was too self conscious with the low cleavage showing my scar tissue. So shopping has been a new challenge. Never a fan of the cowl neck line previously, I now have 3 different cowl neck sweaters/dresses because for some reason this look works for breastless women. It's been over 2 years since my surgery. The scars have healed (although I still don't have much sensation in my chest area or underneath my arms--apparently when they remove your lymph nodes and your breasts and cut through these nerves, they can take a long time to wake up, if they ever do--my surgeon says not to worry about it, so I don't). And I've healed. I don't walk around thinking about myself as someone with breast cancer. Then again, I never forget it. Like with any non-visible but potent identity, it's something I'm always aware of but don't think about all the time. So the word I would use, now, to talk about not having breasts? Normal. This is my new normal. And not having breasts feels normal to me. I can name a few milestones. The first time I changed in a woman's locker room at a spa. I was extraordinarily self conscious--this was pretty early on, February 2011. I wanted to treat myself to a few spa treatments because my skin was wrecked after chemo (chapped, dry, dehydrated) and because I wanted to treat myself after going through that whole experience. I was the only person in the locker room, but I worried that there might be other women who would come in and see me...and then what? I don't know whether I was afraid that they'd be embarrassed or I'd be embarrassed or both. And what would we be embarrassed about? My deformity (because that's what it felt like then). My visible mark of having breast cancer? I changed quickly and was grateful that no one came in. I considered this a minor triumph that I didn't use the privacy booth but was able to just change in public, even if I felt anxious about it. The next milestone also came at a spa, this time in San Francisco this past May 2010. I was going to a Japanese bath house with my old college roommates. I'd been naked around them many, many times--including post-surgery (we all rented a house and went skinny dipping in the hot tub). But this would be the first time I would be naked not just with them but in a public space with other women--women I didn't know. You can wear a bathing suit, but of the thirty to forty women I encountered at the spa, I'd say only about three women opted to wear a bathing suit. Everyone else (as I figured they would) were naked. I had brought along my bathing suit and just assumed that I'd be one of the few women going clothed, but when we were in the locker room and I started getting out of my street clothes, I just simply put on my robe without the suit and walked out with the rest of my friends. And while I was initially self conscious, I quickly forgot about my breastless difference from the other breasted women and just enjoyed being in so much water and steam and with my very dear and close friends. It might have also helped that without my glasses, I'm blind as a bat so I couldn't see if anyone had a weird reaction to seeing me and my missing breasts. The last milestone just happened in November. I was attending a conference in San Juan Puerto Rico (The American Studies Association--yes, it does sound like a boondoggle, but I was actually on two panels). A group of friends rented a set of condos a block from the beach, so we were constantly going back and forth between the conference site and the beach. The friend I was sharing a room with is someone I've known for nearly a decade, but we had never really lived together like roommates before. Nevertheless, we're very comfortable with each other and early on I asked if she minded if I just walked naked from my room to the bathroom (easier than doing the towel thing--and I suppose I'm outing myself, but I do walk around naked in my house -- with the windows shut of course -- if it's just easier going from one room to another). Anyway, it wasn't until after I returned home that I realized this was the first time I had been naked around someone new when I didn't ask them if they were uncomfortable seeing me without breasts--where I didn't think of my body as different from my friends' bodies or needing to be explained or accounted for in any way as different from them. In other words, I had normalized my breast-less state. I forgot about my breast-less difference. I was living my life and thinking of myself as Jennifer rather than Jennifer without breasts. So there you have it. I'm sure there are going to be more moments in the future where I feel self conscious or where I second guess myself on being in a locker room. The above three milestones all occurred in very private spaces or with very close friends. But what has surprised me is how quickly I've adjusted and how I'm not sad about missing my breasts anymore. I am not glad not to have breasts, but among the things I love is not wearing a bra while jogging, not wearing a bra period....OK, so that's it. Not wearing a bra. Still, the list of things I'm sad about (sexual pleasure) is manageable (we can derive sexual pleasure in so many different ways--and honestly we are such a breast fixated nation, in some ways this is just an exercise in healthy diversity of sexual practices). This is my new normal and it feel comfortable to me.",0,1,0.10739284997563145

1210,9,22,18,10,2011,2011-10-18,"One year ago today, October 18, I underwent a bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery as part of my breast cancer treatment. I went to the hospital in the morning with my husband and mother, where the radiology clinic injected my breasts with dye (which really hurt!) to trace the dye to my sentinel lymph nodes (which they removed along with my breasts to ensure that the cancer hadn't migrated to my lymph system). And then I waited for about two hours (maybe it was even three) before being taken into the pre-surgery room. I was hooked up to an i.v. My personal items were put in a bag (including my glasses, which I'm blind without). I hugged my Mom and Matthew good-bye. And then I was wheeled into the surgery, where the last thing I remembered was the anesthesiologist telling me that he would count to three and I should be asleep, and I think I made it to one... And then there was the very disorienting experience of waking up in the recovery room. I felt very groggy and confused. I could hear the voice of an elderly man who was crying and demanding to be let out and the angry voice of a nurse telling him that he just finished surgery and he needed to calm down. When I could finally open my eyes and signal to a nurse, I felt a pain in my throat (they had to intubate me during the surgery) and I was incredibly thirsty. And I wanted to know where Matthew and my mother were. The nurse found Matthew, they wheeled me to my private room (with my mother meeting me en-route), and they told me how to work the pain meds (which I immediately did click). This all happened a year ago. Literally. It's now 6:05pm and I got out of surgery at about this time a year ago. And it seems so odd that I went through this experience. A friend just yesterday asked if I felt disconnected from the experience--as if this all happened to someone else. And that's not how I feel at all--I definitely felt it, I definitely lived it. And now? Now...I'm trying to figure out what it's like to have gone through this. Not in a way that will give me closure--there isn't real closure for me about this. I'm trying to find a language and a way to tell this story, I suppose (this is the professional/academic part of me coming out--the side of me that thinks in terms of narrative). I'm trying to make sense of this experience--of trying to sort out my feelings about all of this--what I went through in the past and how I'm dealing with this now. One of the things that I've been trying to sort out is, just how bad was it? I think there are multiple reasons I ask this. One is that it's partly my nature--I pride myself in being the person who tries to suck it up and push through and not whine about how hard things are. Did going through chemotherapy suck? Was losing my breasts hard? Yes and yes. But I'm alive. And compared to others--those who are facing metastic cancer, breast or otherwise, I seem to be doing pretty well. And compared to relatives who have died from cancer (an uncle to colon cancer, an aunt to leukemia), my treatment was not that bad and my prognosis is definitely good. And truthfully, I don't know that when I was going through everything that I felt like I was suffering. Yes, chemotherapy is toxic--it's a hard treatment to endure. I lost my hair. My taste buds changed. I developed neuropathy in my fingers. I was constantly fatigued. And recovering from surgery was hard. I still feel twinges of pain from the scars where my drains came out of my body. But I don't know that I felt like I was struggling. Maybe because I had A LOT of support. Maybe because I had a lot of information. Maybe because I had wonderful examples of women who survived and are now thriving, who had once been diagnosed with breast cancer. So there's a part of me that feels like what I went through, while hard, wasn't THAT hard--that I didn't experience it as a constant trauma. And yet. I feel traumatized. Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself. I am large. I contain multitudes. [and yes, I just plagiarized from Walt Whitman--although is it plagiarism when you admit the source?] And that's the rub. On the one hand, I feel that what I went through was manageable and not that bad and that as someone who lived through this experience, the important thing is that I LIVED through it--and I did so relatively intact and without experiencing any seriously horrible side-effects--and I had HUGE HUGE support. But on the other hand...I'm forever altered. I am literally deformed. De-formed. I have grief for my breasts and the sense of what if...what if it comes back...what if I am one of the women who develops metastic breast cancer... So it's been a year since my surgery. And to commemorate this year anniversary, I decided to alter my body through a piece of permanent body art--a tattoo: [view of tattoo on the inside of my left ankle] [close-up of lotus tattoo] I chose a lotus because of its symbolism of renewal--of beauty born from the muck and mud--and of its Buddhist symbolism of enlightenment and progress. I miss my breasts but I love my tattoo and I'm certainly glad to be alive.",0,-1,-0.02098595848595847
1211,9,23,20,4,2011,2011-04-20,"It has been a year (over a year actually) since I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. The anniversary happened last Friday--April 15 (tax day). It is also the day after Matthew's birthday, so this year we spent Friday waiting for the Best Buy Geek Squad to come by because as a surprise for Matthew and in celebration of his 30th birthday (yes, he's a young'un) I got him a complete home theater system--as in a 46"" plasma flat screen t.v. and a rotating wall mount that comes out 20 inches from the wall and a blu ray player that has wifi capability (yay for streaming Netflix and Pandora) and a copy of Inception. So Friday was spent waiting for the Best Buy guys. Because they give you this range (in our case it was 8-12pm) but then Elvis, our Geek tech, said he couldn't find the t.v., so by the time they got here (11:30am) and sussed out our place, and actually did the installation (which included cutting into the dry wall, going into the crawlspace underneath our house to route the cable to the new side of the living room where we were mounting the television) it was 3:30pm. And because I was battling the tail end of the adenovirus, it meant that I was pretty wiped out by the afternoon, so my plan of commemorating the day with a trip to the tattoo parlor to get a lotus tattoo put on my right ankle just didn't happen because I had a rip roaring headache and decided I should just lie down and nap (which I did in-between watching Netflix films in true couch potato style by lying down and barely moving from one spot). So why am I sharing all of the mundane facts about my year cancer anniversary diagnosis? Because I have been thinking about how to honor and commemorate the day. And the plan, as modest as it was, was for me to get the t.v. installed in the morning and then go to the tattoo parlor in the afternoon. But the tattoo parlor was busy until 7pm and I was too tired, and truly, the best laid plans you can make for yourself can just end up falling by the wayside. Which is OK. At least this is what I tell myself. The plans I have made for myself have often not come through--and certainly the caner diagnosis happening a year ago put on hold or indefinitely postponed many different plans that Matthew and I had for our lives together. Like our honeymoon (which we are taking this August) and our plans to start a family (which we are hoping to take the first of many steps taken over many months by attending an info session this summer about open adoption). There's more that I've wanted to write in this space--about feeling better once I recognized that I was depressed, in large part because the recognition itself is therapeutic but also because I have an amazing therapist, Phyllis, who I can't say enough positive things about. And the warmer weather has also helped my mood--as has the increase, the slow increase, in my energy level--which got a boost by going to NYC over spring break and hanging out with my cousins Wayne and Craig. I also wanted to write about Relay for Life--which happened 2 weeks ago without me walking the survivor's opening lap because I was felled by the adenovirus, but truthfully I wasn't sure I was up for being clapped at while walking around the track (more on that later), and finally, I wanted to write about my decision to try to write, in a more formal and organized way, some of my story--about what it has been like for me to have this diagnosis. Anyway, this isn't a very coherent post, I know. But it was a year ago today, April 20, 2010, that I wrote my first entry in this blog. And because I like symmetry and because I did want to mark the year anniversary of my diagnosis in some way, I thought it was high time that I broke my blogging silence and acknowledged that I've had a roller coaster of a year. I can't say that it's all been awful. I mean the awful stuff has been awful--I wouldn't wish chemo on my worst enemy, my hair falling out was horrific, my recovery from surgery was painful, and being faced with the potential reality that my life span may be cut short meant moments of fear, anxiety, and terror. But this past year also was the year I married Matthew and had a weekend full of family and friends and love and laughter and great food. And I turned in my tenure file in August and received the great news that the vote in my department was unanimous in February, and just this past Monday I received a phone call from my chair that the second hurdle was over (the College committee) and my file was on its way to the Provost's committee--which is essentially the 3rd and final hurdle. So there has been pleasure as well as pain, and light as well as darkness. Which is pretty much what life is. Which means I don't think I really did learn any new or profound wisdom after being diagnosed with cancer. I think I just re-learned the things that I already knew--that life is unpredictable and you can make all the plans you want, but sometimes things happen and you just have to roll with them. Sometimes it's OK to just lie on the sofa watching Netflix films and napping. I tend to burn the candle at both ends so it's a good reminder and metaphor for me--that the world will not stop spinning on its axis if I'm not constantly in motion and if the plans I make don't actually happen. I wish I had something more profound to share on my year anniversary, but maybe that's about as profound as I get. Or maybe it's appropriate because sometimes the profundity of a situation isn't going to just happen because I want to mark the anniversary of an event.",0,1,0.12440571811053741
1212,9,24,31,8,2011,2011-08-31,"So first of all, an apology. Both for the long lapse between blog posts (I knew it had been a while, but June 5??? That's a REALLY long time) and for not explaining that I'd be taking a break from blogging. Of course, the truth is, I didn't realize that I was taking a break from blogging. Maybe more specifically, taking a break from thinking about cancer. My cancer. My post-cancer life. Being N.E.D. (no evidence of disease). But a while ago, when someone asked me if I was still blogging on this site, I said that I wanted to take a break from thinking of myself as someone with cancer or someone who had had cancer. But I should have said this all in a brief post--especially because looking at the last post, where I'm about to see whether I have a cyst or malignancy on my uterus, it leaves people wondering a bit. So the first thing I'll say is that my ultrasound was clear. All is good. And my follow-up appointment with my surgeon was also good (I think that happened a few days after I wrote the last post). I'm taking Tamoxifen, and aside from a few hot flashes, mostly at night (2-3 episodes), I don't seem to be having any side effects. I am, by all physical evidence at least, the vision of health. I've been exercising and lost a few of the pounds I gained in the spring semester when I was too weary to do anything beyond teach and sleep. My mental health is good--or at least I'm no longer experiencing a low level depression. And there doesn't seem to be any signs of cancer in my body that they can detect through blood work of physical examination--and my body seems to be holding up pretty well so far, meaning I'm having no other health issues and feel fine. So I'm a healthy person. I look like a healthy person. I feel like a healthy person. Yet there is that little question in the back of my mind--am I? Or perhaps more accurately, ""for how long?"" Because truthfully, even if I never have a recurrence, as my body ages I will probably have some kind of health issue where I experience a period of not being well--of being disabled--of being ill. We all will. It's a sobering thought. And the fact that I think this way is probably a sign both of what I've recently experienced with cancer/chemo/surgery as well as a sign that I'm getting older and recognizing that my 41 year old body is not my 21 year old body and will one day be a 61 year old body with different types of challenges (joints, I'm told, become a problem as we age). In other words, these are the musings of a middle-age person not of a young, vibrant 20-something or teen or even 30 something person--at least not someone who hasn't been through or witnessed intimately the deterioration of someone else's body or their own for a period of time. Anyway, I thought about whether I wanted to take this blog down, but I think that there are still things I'm exploring and figuring out about living my life post-cancer. And there are certainly things about cancer in the world that I think are worth commenting on--like this piece in The New York Times about the language of cancer--especially all those ""fighting"" words we associate with the disease. And there's the presentation I gave at the annual meeting of the Association of Asian American Studies--one that talked about my experiences with getting breast cancer and the lack of Asian American models and stories out there. It was the most intimate presentation I have ever given--and while I was nervous when I first started to read my paper, by the end I had found my stride and really felt comfortable talking about what I'd been through, both from a personal as well as intellectual point-of-view. So I'm not done blogging here. I may not be updating on a regular basis--there will probably be weeks between posts. But if you are curious about what life is like for one particular former stage 2 breast cancer patient, please continue to tune in.",0,1,0.14147478930087623
1214,9,3,6,7,2012,2012-07-06,"It has been a LONG time since I've blogged on NFPR. There have been times, off and on, when I've thought about logging in and sharing a story or insight or observation. There have been moments when I've wanted to write to process what I was going through. Or to record an amusing anecdote. Or to mark an anniversary: The 2nd year anniversary of my cancer diagnosis (which is also, unfortunately, the day after my husband's birthday--it will remain unforgettable for us on many levels). The 2nd year anniversary of my port being put in. The 2nd year anniversary of when I started chemo. But, of course, I didn't. Didn't write about these milestones. Didn't commemorate them. Didn't even note them, in some cases, until after the fact. So why am I back now? Not sure. Maybe because in doing research for a chapter I'm writing on transracial/transnational adoptee blogs, I came across an essay by a theorist who works on narrative and new media, and she was writing about the gendered nature of cancer blogs. And in describing the various ""story-genres"" and purposes for which women wrote about their breast cancer (and all of the blogs she analyzed were breast cancer blogs--at least the ones written by women--she also looked at male bloggers who wrote about a variety of cancers that they were experiencing), I was reminded of my own blog--how useful and helpful it had been for me to have a place to talk about my experiences with cancer. To vent my rage and frustration and anxiety about going making treatment decisions, through chemotherapy, preparing for surgery, living without breasts, and thinking about my mortality. Recently I learned that my ex-husband's stepmother (are you following that chain?) died a year ago from ovarian cancer. She had been a breast cancer survivor. Her ovarian cancer came nearly ten years after her breast cancer diagnosis and seems to have been a result of the chemotherapy and radiation treatment that she underwent. I'm, unfortunately, no longer in touch with my ex-husband or his father/family (I learned about her passing through a mutual friend), but I felt sad and freaked out, both for her/her family and for myself. This is what having cancer does--it makes you selfish. It makes you think and wonder about whether it's going to happen to you. I mean, of course I was sorry about her passing. And it felt weird to learn about her death from someone other than my ex-husband--highlighting the estrangement from a family that I'd been married into for over a decade. But part of my sadness over her passing was also a sadness at wondering whether her fate could be my fate. Would this be my fate in another 8 years. Could I be developing cancer in my ovaries, in my uterus, as a result of the chemotherapy or just because--just because when you have cancer, there is a potential for it to spread to other parts of your body. And uterine and ovarian cancer is so difficult to detect because you can't see or feel the tumor. A week ago I was having drinks with some friends, and someone brought up the fact that she sometimes forgot that I had had cancer. I know what she means--at least, I know why she could forget. I don't talk about it very often--I mean, it doesn't really come up in everyday conversation. And there are few visual reminders. I suppose the most prominent one is that I no longer have breasts, but since I was small to begin with and since I've learned to select clothes that don't enhance my bust (or missing bustline) it's easy to forget that there's a part of me that's missing, especially now that my hair has completely grown back in (and it has grown back thicker and darker than before, if you can believe that--I have less gray hair now than I did pre-cancer--not that I ever had a lot of white hair--I inherited my father's genes for that because he didn't go gray until he turned 50 and then ""poof!"" it was all overnight). So I totally understand why my friend sometimes forgets that I have cancer, and why no one who didn't know me 2 years ago would even wonder about me and whether I'd had breast cancer because I just look like a normal, healthy woman in her early 40s (Matthew would say I look like I'm in my early 30s, but he may be looking at me with eyes of love). But I don't ever forget. And I don't mean because there's ocular evidence everytime I shower and look down at my scars. I mean because I feel like being a person with cancer--having experienced chemotherapy and the various surgeries I had related to my cancer diagnosis--that's now all a part of who I am. I think about being a person with a cancer diagnosis (notice that I still don't feel comfortable calling myself a ""survivor"") in the same way that I think about myself as a woman or as an Asian American. These identities are part of who I am in such a naturalized, almost essentialized (I use that word, hesistantly, since I'm not trying to say that there is an essentialized element or quality to being a woman or being Asian, but perhaps I don't need to be so academically cautious in this space). I've internalized having a cancer diagnosis and going through cancer treatment in the same way that I've internalized the fact that I have an Asian face. These are parts of me that just are and that are unforgettable to me. Anyway, I think it might be time for me to start writing in this space again. I needed some distance from thinking about myself in relation to my cancer. But I might be ready to start exploring some things that I've been thinking about...like what the best thing is about not having breasts (I'll save that for a future post). So if anyone is still reading this blog from its initial startup 2 years ago, thanks for being a loyal reader. And for anyone new, I hope that this blog provides some interesting insights for you, and feel free to leave a comment.",0,1,0.059711034394578706
1215,9,4,7,10,2011,2011-10-07,"So yesterday I saw the film 50/50. I had blogged about it earlier and had been eager to watch it because it seemed at least in the trailers, to be a frank and funny look at what it is like to get a cancer diagnosis and go through treatment. What I wasn’t prepared for was that it was also very heartfelt. Many cancer films often, intentionally or not, traffic in sentimentality—there is the stirring music, the sick patient lying stoicly in the hospital room, the tragic revelation of disease or death. There wasn’t anything sentimental about this film. It was one of the things I had been hoping for—an unsentimental look at cancer. But that doesn’t mean that it wasn’t hard—that it wasn’t emotionally stirring. Because in its direct approach and in the portrayal of this man’s experience going to chemo and having surgery, it so vividly mirrored my own experience—the kind of prosaic nature of what it’s like to sit in a chemo chair for 4 hours, the kinds of conversations you strike up with folks in neighboring chairs. The fear that you try not to show or even acknowledge to yourself let alone to others, and yet that does surface, as it will surface, when you are wondering whether the treatment is working. Whether you will survive this surgery. And it was the scene of the surgery in particular that really caught me off guard. I’m not going to give anything away (and the fact that he has surgery is also not something that anyone who is going to watch a cancer film is going to be surprised at either hopefully) but I did want to explain what it was that hit me in the gut. It was his vulnerability. And I don’t necessarily mean what the actor portrayed (although I do think that Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job in this scene of portraying vulnerability)—I guess what I mean is the simple image of seeing him in a gown on a gurney about to be wheeled into surgery, saying good-bye to his mother and talking to the anesthesiologist about not being sure whether they’d give you enough drugs so that you wouldn’t wake up in the middle of the procedure or that they would give you too much so that you wouldn’t wake up in recovery. Apparently these were the exact questions I asked before my own surgery. I don’t remember—the whole thing was a blur. But when we were driving back from the film yesterday Matthew reminded me that I asked my own anesthesiologist these very questions. And he admitted that he cried in this scene because it was so real—because just a year ago, that had been me, with Matthew and my Mom—saying good-bye to me before being wheeled in to have my double-mastectomy surgery. The weird thing is, I don’t remember being nervous. I’m pretty sure that they slipped in some anti-anxiety meds in my i.v. line (smart thing), so what I recall isn’t panic or fear but just a sense of calm. I remember feeling like it would all be OK, I’d take a nap and then I’d wake up and… I suppose it’s the “and” that I didn’t know how to wrap my mind around. And in some ways still don’t. Which is why seeing that character being wheeled into surgery just hit me in the gut. Because he said all the things I had been thinking and feeling and a year later, still carry with me. The grief of a cancer diagnosis—of my cancer diagnosis—hasn’t resolved. I wonder whether it will.",0,1,0.0888541666666667
1216,9,5,2,9,2011,2011-09-02,"Let me tell you about my Aunt Teri. When I was growing up, I had 2 Aunts named Teresa--with different middle names. So as a way to distinguish them, I called the youngest one, Shaoliang, which my father said meant ""little aunt"" in Mandarin. It, apparently, also sounds close to ""little sheep"" and so I used to draw a picture of a little sheep when I would write letters to her. My Aunt Teri was one of those people who created community wherever she lived--and she and my Uncle moved around to various places throughout their lives. But she really had a knack of cultivating friendships of a breadth and depth that is unusual--in other words, she has both a very large and intimate circle of friends from every place she has ever lived. When I recently confessed to her that I was nervous at the thought of being a parent (Matthew and I are looking into adoption--which will be the subject of a future post, I'm sure--what it's like to be a breast cancer survivor going through the domestic adoption process) and when I asked her whether she had ever been nervous, she told me that she had always known that she wanted to be a mother--that it was one of the things she was most proud of--and that she knew that it was what she was meant to do--be a Mom--be someone who could give unconditional love to children. My Aunt Teri was a stubborn person--a trait common on both sides of my family. She had stores of compassion but also stores of stuborness--she was not a pushover but could assert herself in a caring yet forceful way. There were times when she would not take no for an answer. She knew how to fight for what she wanted--for what she felt was right--for what was important. This morning my Aunt Teri passed away after complications due to her marrow transplant, which was a result of being diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in February 2010 (2 months before my own breast cancer diagnosis). I got the call right before my 10am class--and I had to shut the door on my emotions in order to get through class (something I've learned to be good at--compartementalizing that is, because I got the news about my cancer diagnosis half an hour before a grad seminar a year and a half ago). Although I've teared up throughout the day--and gotten choked up--I haven't yet had a proper cry. As I told one cousin, I feel emotionally constipated--I can feel something sitting inside my chest, wanting to be let out. And I trust that when the moment is right, my emotions will come spilling out. When I got my breast cancer diagnosis, my aunt was one of the first people to call and reach out to me. She shared helpful hints and suggestions about going through chemo and things to eat. We talked about our similar experiences--and the differences in our cancer treatment and care. We were connected in this intimate manner, which I know is something neither of us wanted to have happen. This is the fourth relative I've had die of cancer--the first on my father's side. It all feels surreal--the number of family I've had who have died of various cancers. My Aunt Teri was one of my favorite people. She was someone I confided in and trusted. She is someone I love wholeheartedly and who will always live in my heart. And I will always miss her. Always.

1217,9,6,15,4,2013,2013-04-15,"Three years ago today I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I remember being slightly nervous/anxious all morning and the early afternoon. And I remember chiding myself for feeling so anxious--that the results would be negative and I'd feel silly, later, for spending so much time fretting about nothing. Except that I was wrong. It wasn't nothing--it was stage 2 breast cancer in my left breast and DCIS in my right. April 15 is tax day, but it's always going to be ""the day I found out I had cancer."" How could it not? But this morning I also learned that a childhood friend, Tina, passed away yesterday. She had also had breast cancer--diagnosed much earlier than mine. I can't recall the specifics of her own diagnosis--we were friends from music camp when we were teenagers, had drifted apart, but had briefly come together from time to time when our paths crossed--when I came back to California while living in Boston (where Tina was doing a PhD in French literature at UC Berkeley and I was doing my own PhD at Boston University) and then when I was visiting Paris, where she had relocated with her husband. When she found out about my diagnosis through a mutual friend, she sent me a really lovely message--supportive and generous and funny, which sums up many of the wonderful qualities of Tina. She was also driven, smart, and beautiful. The most lasting memory I'll have of Tina is sipping a kir royale in the Latin Quarter of Paris while listening to a jazz quartet. It sounds like a cliche--one of those Parisian moments that happens in movies. And walking, afterwards, along the Seine with Tina and her husband Renaud, I felt like I was in a movie--that it was a perfect night because of where I was and who I was with. The last time I saw Tina was when she hugged me good-bye at the entrance to the metro by Notre Dame--I have a picture of the two of us, at night, with Notre Dame lit up in the background. I feel sad. And, I suppose there's also the odd coincidence of learning about her death today. When I found out, last week, that she had come back to SF to seek treatment and that she was, essentially, dying, I felt freaked out--and knew it was a matter of days. But it doesn't really make a difference knowing that someone is going to be passing soon. I suppose it might take some of the blunt shock away, and maybe it helps people prepare themselves. But it still feels shocking. Even knowing that it is going to happen--that it's inevitable--it still surprised me. There's a built in mechanism that many of us have--a denial mechanism that says we're going to live forever. Sure we'll get older and maybe we'll have injuries or illnesses, but modern medicine is a wonderful thing and you hear stories all the time about the 90 year old who ran a marathon, the 80 year old who climbed Everest, the 94 year old who went back to college and finally got that degree. And you think you'll just keep living your life until... My cancer diagnosis was like having that mechanism disabled. It was a reminder that people do die. I will die. You will die. The people we love will die. It's a mortality wake up call. And in the three years since that diagnosis, I've been able to get that mechanism to work again--I've been able, from time to time, to think that maybe I really will live forever--maybe I'll finally decide to go sky diving when I'm in my 70s. Maybe I'll have a second career as a French chef when I'm in my 80s. I've been able to think that maybe my cancer really is gone--that as the clock ticks up to my 5 year mark, maybe I'll really be able to say I'm cured. But maybe not. Maybe the mechanism, that denial mechanism, is actually permanently broken in me, like a non-digital clock that tells time correctly only twice a day--maybe that's what it's like for me and the rest of the time I know. I know I'm going to die. I just don't know when or how. That's probably one of the scars I have that won't go away. Because I wonder. When I have a weird pain in my abdomen, I wonder if a tumor is growing in my uterus or ovaries. Because when I find myself more tired than usual, I wonder if it's just being middle-aged or if it's a sign that the cancer has come back. Because when I learn that another person has died of breast cancer like my friend Tina, it's a reminder that people still die from this disease. RIP Tina. I'm glad you aren't in pain anymore. I'm sorry for everyone you left behind who will have a Tina sized hole in their hearts. I'm grateful to have known you and to have my last memory of you be a picture perfect Parisian memory that is happy. Thank you.",0,1,0.13740930431071274
1218,9,7,17,1,2011,2011-01-17,"Yesterday I was mistaken for a man. It happened at the Harris Teeter near Timberlyne up on MLK way. It was around 10am. I had just come from visiting Matthew at Cup of Joe and had on a Cup of Joe baseball cap (more like a Greek fisherman's cap), my flannel jacket from Nepal (it's black with multicolor bands at the wrists), and my yoga pants (which for me means my ankles are showing) with my keen slip ons. I mention this because I think if one were to see me, the entire me, there are sartorial signs that may read more as ""feminine"" than ""masculine"" or at least clothing you'd associate more with a woman (yoga pants), although I also recognize that some of my other clothing may have seemed either masculine or androgynous (baseball cap, keen shoes). The jacket probably just registered as ""ethnic."" Anyway, I was standing in line with my basket and a checker appeared and said directly to me, ""Sir, I can take you at that counter,"" pointing to the register to my left. I literally looked in back of me, wondering if perhaps I was mistaken in who he was speaking to, and then I realized that, no, it was ME, and I dutifully followed him. And then I had to make a decision: do I say something or not say something. Do I try to pass as a guy or do I let him know he's made a mistake. Since I am pretty sure that as low voiced as I *think* I am, I'm really not so low pitched as to be mistaken for a guy. I also think that upon closer inspection (like seeing the diamond wedding band that I wear or the bracelet on my wrist) the guy might realize his mistake and feel more embarrassed. So I said to him, ""Even though I know I look like a guy, I'm actually a woman."" I said this without any judgment or inflection--just stated it as matter-of-factly as I could. The checker (a college aged kid) was pretty chagrined--apologized--but I smiled and told him it was my short hair that fooled him. And he smiled, relieved, and agreed that the hair was what made him think I was a man. Which of course has led me to think about my gender identity--or the way that I present myself as a woman. Because previous to my cancer/chemo/surgery, I would have told you that I exhibit pretty masculine traits. That I liked wearing men's shirts (especially oversized white button down shirts); that I used to sing tenor parts in the chorus during high school because there weren't enough boys to sing those parts; that I have that annoying ""male"" way of interrupting people during conversations and other verbal markers that signal a more masculine rather than feminine talking style. And, in general, I just would have said that I don't *feel* very feminine. To which I now say: RUBBISH. I mean, you don't know what it's like not to feel feminine until you lose your hair and your breasts. I also think it was easy for me to say that I felt masculine, because my female identity and my hetero identity were so firmly entrenched and seemingly one and the same. In other words, I wonder to what degree it's easy for me, as a straight-identified, pre-bilateral mastectomy and pre-chemotherapy-loss-of-hair woman, to say that I identify as ""masculine"" or feel myself to have ""masculine"" traits when so many of my obvious physical features read ""feminine""--including my clothes and accessories: necklaces, rings, dresses, etc... Even more androgynous clothing like jeans or suit jackets were tailored for women rather than men--as well as my shoes--they clearly read female. Yet ever since the loss of my hair and the loss of my breasts, I've been thinking about my gender identity, in terms of my physical features. I've been wondering about what parts of me are still coded as feminine and which parts of me may truly seem to be more androgynous, more masculine. When I look at myself from the neck down wearing a t-shirt for example, I encounter a flat chest that resembles a boy's more than a woman's. And when I look at myself in the mirror, with my hair cropped close to my head, I see an uncanny resemblance to my male cousins. In fact, when I had my head shaved by Matthew back in July, my mother remarked that I in the photos I posted on this blog I looked just like my Uncle Hunter. All of which has made me realize that as much as I may look like a boy, I actually do feel like a girl (or woman rather). I actually identify, quite strongly, with being a woman--because my mannerisms, my clothing choices, my body language, my voice, are all coded as feminine and all convey a sense of my womanliness. My missing breasts didn't make me more of a woman, nor more feminine. My hair, well that's a different story. I do think that short hair plus androgynous clothing can equal gender confusion. Which may be why I'm not sure if I'll be keeping my hair short. That as much as I like to academically think about ambiguity, I'm not sure how I feel about being in an ambiguously gendered body. And yet there's a part of me that thinks that perhaps this is a time for me to explore androgyny--to explore what it means to occupy a body that is feminine without such feminine markers as longer hair and breasts. To think about what it may mean for me to either intentionally pass as male or to allow myself to be mis-read--to not have corrected the check-out clerk but to just let him make his own assumptions about who I am. Something to think about as I more through space in this new body of mine and a key question for me to wonder about is: what will I feel like wearing a summer dress? Will this be a moment when I feel the full weight of the loss of my breasts and the loss of a part of my femininity? I suppose we'll have to wait until May to find out.",0,1,0.11322381114515942
1219,9,8,16,5,2011,2011-05-16,"I know I haven't been writing on a regular basis in this blog. The semester really kicked my ass, energy wise. And then realizing that I was dealing with low-grade depression also left me for a loop (thank goodness for a great psychotherapist--I can't say enough positive things about Dr. Phyllis Hicks!). And of course the end of semester is always just a busy time--meeting with students, grading papers, tying up loose ends. But perhaps I also haven't been writing because I've been taking a break from thinking about cancer or thinking about my cancer in particular. And I realize that I've been a bit allergic to thinking about myself as a cancer survivor or someone with cancer. It's not, exactly, that I want to pass as a healthy person (and by writing that, I don't mean to suggest that I'm not healthy right now, but as someone only a year past diagnosis and less than a year past chemo and surgery, I'm not exactly sure that ""healthy"" is what comes to mind when I think about my body) or to deny the experience that I had this past year with chemo and surgery--and the uncertainty that any cancer diagnosis brings. But I think I wanted to think of myself as ""normal"" again--or at least as not a cancer patient anymore. Yet two weeks ago I was thrust in the belly of the beast so to speak--because I flew to Milwaukee to see a favorite aunt of mine (I'll call her ""T"" to protect her privacy and that of my uncle ""B""). Aunt T was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia last February. My original plan was to fly out to see her over the summer, but then 2 months later I received my own cancer diagnosis, so 2 weeks ago was the soonest I could fly out to spend any substantive time with her. Unfortunately that time was spent in the Bone Marrow Transplant ward, where she returned to after her successful haploidentical transplant (in her case a stem cell transplant from 2 different sources) due to infections she had developed, which also led to her malnutrition issues, which then led to edema (swelling). I had originally planned to visit her and to help with her homecare post-transplant surgery, but instead I found myself visiting her every day for the week that I was there, observing proper protocol for someone who is in an isolation room--meaning, I scrubbed my hands thoroughly and put on a paper gown before entering her room, and I scrubbed my hands thoroughly after I left. [Note: these procedures were more to protect other bone marrow transplant patients from catching one of the infections that she developed rather than protecting her from anything I was bringing in, although I'm sure that must have helped] The good news (because I should cut to the good news) is that my aunt is improving and the even better news is that the transplant seems to be working--her body is producing white and red blood cells--remission may well be part of her future. But good news aside, it is sobering to visit anyone in a bone marrow transplant unit, regardless of the prognosis. It was a chance for me to see, very up close and personal, what happens to us when our bodies fail us--particularly when we receive a cancer diagnosis so extreme that it requires what seems to me to be a radical procedure--to erase one's immune system and source of blood and replace it with someone else's (or multiple someone else's in my aunt's case). Any transplant has risks and dangers involved--a bone marrow transplant is no different, and, indeed, is in many ways more risky, I think, because of the concern of the cancer coming back despite the pain and agony (physical but especially emotional and psychological) of the transplant. I was worried before leaving for Milwaukee that I would feel freaked out--that seeing my aunt in the hospital and visiting her, particularly, in the BMT ward, would hit too close to home--would make me feel my own vulnerability regarding a cancer diagnosis too keenly. I was worried that I might freeze up around her--that I would be awkward and werid--would not know the right thing to say or do. I suppose in many ways I felt the way that others feel when confronted with a loved one who is sick or has cancer. I suppose in many ways I felt the way that many healthy people hearing about my breast cancer diagnosis felt--that they didn't know what to say or do and worried they might say the wrong thing. And while the first two days were hard for me, emotionally, I quickly recognized that as hard as it might have been to see my aunt in her current state, it was much harder to BE my aunt. And being with her for a week was illuminating to me about how much she wants to live--how much she wants to fight her disease (her motto is ""kicking butt"" with respect to her cancer--perhaps we are both angry Asian American women when it comes to this disease). It was illuminating, to me, to see my aunt in her condition because I realized that at some point, this might be me or it might be someone else I love. And what I mean by that is, in spending time with my aunt in the BMT ward, I recognized the fragility and vulnerability of the human body. I know I've written about this before, but my cancer diagnosis has had me thinking more and more about my own mortality and about what the end of my life will be like. It is uncertain--all of our lives are uncertain in that respect--but I feel after this recent experience with my aunt that I have a greater appreciation for what happens when our bodies start to fail us, regardless of the reason why and regardless of whether it's temporary (which I hope it is in my aunt's case) or permanent (as it will be eventually for all of us).",0,1,0.1459793607752791
1220,9,9,11,12,2010,2010-12-11,"On December 13, it will be 8 weeks since I had my bi-lateral (double) mastectomy surgery and 4 weeks since the last drain was removed from my right side. It will also be 12 weeks since my last round of chemo and approximately 6 months since I was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2010. How am I doing? This is the question I am most asked from friends and colleagues and acquaintances when I see them after a few days/weeks/months. It was the #1 question I got when I went to my department's holiday party last week. And my answer, genuine and consistent, is that I'm good, or to be grammatically correct, I'm well. I'm doing just fine. I'm still a bit tight in my chest--yoga and the physical therapy exercises definitely help--and I'm definitely still tired/fatigued as a result of the healing that my body is still undergoing. Case in point: after being on my feet for 3 hours on Wed. at the holiday party (and I attended the IAH party before the English dept party, so it was really TWO holiday parties I went to on Wednesday) I spent the next 2 days either in-bed or on the couch because I WAS SO TIRED I COULD NOT MOVE--QUITE LITERALLY, I WAS CRASHED OUT AND CLEARLY MY BODY WAS SAYING STOP, YOU NEED TO REST. But really, perhaps what people want to know is ""What is it like not to have breasts? How are you coping psychologically and emotionally?"" So this is the post that talks about missing my missing breasts, and why I chose NOT to do reconstructive surgery. Because I do miss my breasts. Or let me put it this way, I miss MY breasts. It's not just the abstract concept of having a breast or the gendered nature of feeling feminine by being a woman with breasts, or even noticing that my clothes don't quite fit the same way (which is definitely true) but first and foremost, I miss MY breasts--the breasts I was born with, that grew with me as I grew, that I lived with throughout my teen years and learned to take pleasure in, sexually, as I grew into my adult sexuality. And that last point--what my breasts mean to me sexually--is why I did not choose reconstruction. The truth is, prior to my cancer diagnosis, I didn't think a lot about my breasts. I liked them because they were part of my body and, in general, they've worked well for me. They weren't so big that they became cumbersome to me, and they weren't so small that I couldn't fill out a dress nicely. They were, in the words of that immortal children's tale, ""just right."" But I have to say, that I found my nipples, outside of sexual pleasure, a bit inconvenient. In U.S. society we frown on women's nipples (maybe men's nipples too, but it's more acceptable to see them). Women need to cover up their nipples--anyone who has ever seen the machinations to which starlets will go to reveal all parts of their boob except for their nipple will understand what I mean. It would be considered unprofessional for a woman at work to wear a blouse and NOT wear a bra, especially if it was a white shirt or a tight blouse. And I always found wearing bras to be inconvenient for the most part. My way out, during winter months, was the camisole top. I mention all of the above to give you a picture of how I pretty much treated, aesthetically, my breasts. How I feel about my breasts in terms of my sexual life is a different matter. And I know that saying all of this may be odd or make others feel uncomfortable, but the bottom line for me is that my breasts, my nipples, were most important to my sexual identity and sexual life. So when I learned that breast reconstruction would allow me to aesthetically look the way I used to look but would not let me FEEL the way I used to feel, that pretty much sealed the deal for me. Because as I noted above, what I want are MY breasts--I want to feel MY breasts--I don't want to just look down and see that I have breasts or be reassured that my clothes will fit exactly as they had before. First and foremost, reconstruction would feel like a cosmetic choice for me; it would hide the loss of my breasts but would not speak to my emotional loss at their absence. Let me just pause here and say that I know that my view and perspective is a pretty minority view and perspective. Anecdotally, in a very small sample of women who have had double-mastectomy surgery (like about a dozen) only one woman, my maternal aunt, elected not to have reconstructive surgery--and most of my female friends and family told me that if they were in my position, they would definitely want reconstructive surgery--that having breasts are VERY IMPORTANT to their sense of identity--to their sense of normalcy--to their sense of just being women. I do understand this. Completely. I judge no one for their choice in wanting reconstructive surgery. Especially the desire to feel normal again--to feel like you are yourself again. To not want to worry about how your clothes feel or about looking so different--of feeling self conscious while undressing in a locker room or dressing room or even in the privacy of your bedroom and bathroom. I understand the desire to want to feel whole again--and especially with what plastic surgeons are doing nowadays with nipple tattoos--and the improvements in silicon inserts--breast implants and reconstructive surgery gives women who have had mastectomies breasts that are just like their former ones or ideal breasts that they always wanted. And while, for the most part, my family and friends have been very respectful and supportive of my choices, whether they personally would choose the same route or not, what I've been surprised at is the reaction and assumptions from acquaintances and virtual strangers--that everyone assumes that I will change my mind--that the only reason I'm not choosing reconstruction is that all of this is too overwhelming for me and I will change my mind when more time has passed and I have healed. There have been nurses who have assumed I will be doing reconstruction while going through chemotherapy. Strangers have told Matthew that I may say I don't want reconstructive surgery but as a woman I will, of course, change my mind and get reconstructive surgery, I just simply don't know my own mind right now. Friends of friends have told me that I can now have larger breasts or the ideal breasts I've always wanted. Even extended family tell me not to be stubborn and to be open to getting breast reconstruction in the future, assuming that due to my contrary nature that I will secretly want reconstructive surgery a year from now but will be too proud to get it because I've been so vehement about not wanting reconstructive surgery. Is there a possibility I will change my mind? Yes, of course. I think I'd seem too truculent at this point if I say no. But if I were a betting woman, I would not count on me changing my mind. There has never been a point, prior to my cancer diagnosis, during my decision making about whether to do a lumpectomy of both breasts or the bi-lateral mastectomy, during chemotherapy, and leading up to my surgery when I ever thought that I wanted to do reconstruction. There is nothing about reconstruction that is appealing to me. It is not a judgment on anyone's decision to do reconstruction--it is my own level of comfort, my own relationship to my breasts, my own sense of what I miss about my missing breasts, that leads me to this certainty. I miss my missing breasts. I miss having part of the body that I was born with. I miss the absence of my breasts. But having new breasts--ones that aren't part of me, that don't give me any sensation or pleasure--would not take away from my sadness over missing my breasts. In fact, what I feel in my gut is that choosing reconstruction, for me, would be very wrong. It would feel wrong--it would feel false--it would not make me feel whole. On the contrary, it would remind me more starkly than the scars I currently carry with me, of what I have lost. And perhaps, most of all, what I realized before my surgery, in looking at the images I was lucky enough to find on-line of a woman who also chose not to do reconstruction (click here to see her Flickr stream), was that I would be OK. I would be OK without breasts. I would learn to live without my breasts, and it will be weird (it is weird) but at the end of the day, it will also be OK--and that most importantly of all, my decision to not do reconstruction is the right decision for me. [Addendum: I should say that my decision was reinforced by a pamphlet that my wonderful surgeon, Keith Amos, gave to me. It is distributed by a non-profit organization here in Raleigh, Myself: Together Again (click here on the link). It's a wonderful booklet that, in image and text, chronicles a young woman's bi-lateral mastectomy surgery and reconstructive surgery. It shows the scars, her port, the drains, the plastic surgeon's marks, the expanders, and finally what she looks like with her nipple tattoos and the silicon implants in. For anyone considering either breast augmentation or breast reconstruction, this is an important booklet to look at. I was glad to page through it, because my visceral reaction on seeing it was reassurance that I had made the right decision--reconstruction is not for me]",0,1,0.15466387148205335
