0,10,1,[Timestamp('2012-01-28 00:00:00')],"The SCAR Project is a series of large-scale portraits of young women confronting breast cancer shot by fashion photographer David Jay. In the groundbreaking exhibition, this young generation of survivors reveals what is really beneath the pink ribbons. SCAR is an acronym: “Surviving Cancer. Absolute Reality.” Primarily an awareness raising campaign, it puts a raw, unflinching face on young women and breast cancer while paying tribute to the courage and spirit of so many brave young survivors of this disease. To view a slideshow of images on The SCAR Project web site click HERE. Dedicated to the more than 10,000 women under the age of 40 who will be diagnosed this year alone, The SCAR Project is an exercise in awareness, hope, reflection and healing. The mission is three-fold: raise public consciousness of young women with breast cancer, raise funds for breast cancer research/outreach programs, and help young survivors see their scars, faces, figures and experiences through a new, honest and ultimately empowering lens. David Jay has been shooting fashion and beauty professionally for over 15 years. His images have appeared in a multitude of international magazines and advertising campaigns. Like so many others personally touched by the disease, Jay was inspired to act when a dear friend was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 32. Like the subjects themselves, Jay’s stark, bold portraits challenge traditional perceptions of the disease and capture the raw beauty, strength and character of so many extraordinary young women. Each portrait represents a singular, stripped-down vision of the life-changing journey that unites them all. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in young women ages 15-40. The SCAR Project participants range from ages 18 to 35, and represent this often overlooked group of young women living with breast cancer. They journey from across America – and around the world – to be photographed for The SCAR Project. Nearly 100 so far. The youngest being 18 years old. Although Jay began shooting The SCAR Project primarily as an awareness raising campaign, he was not prepared for something much more immediate . . . and beautiful: “For these young women, having their portrait taken seems to represent their personal victory over this terrifying disease. It helps them reclaim their femininity, their sexuality, identity and power after having been robbed of such an important part of it. Through these simple pictures, they seem to gain some acceptance of what has happened to them and the strength to move forward with pride.” The International SCAR Project Exhibition premiered in New York City in October 2010, then in Cincinnati and a second DC showing in October 2011. The SCAR Project will premiere in DC in October, kicking off breast cancer awareness 2012 from our Nation’s Capitol. This blog will follow The SCAR Project exhibition as it tours, David Jay as he continues to shoot the portraits, and will also feature interviews with The SCAR Girls.",1,1,0.15060555386642338
1,10,10,[Timestamp('2012-08-09 00:00:00')],"[I met today’s guest blogger at the first planning committee meeting for The SCAR Project DC exhibition. I was instantly drawn to Lauren, not just because of her striking though gentle beauty (as you can see in her SCAR portrait below) but also (as you will see when you read her story) because she is a kindred writing spirit. Since getting to know her something else that really puts the L in Lauren, methinks, is best summed up in some lyrics she posted recently on Facebook: “Until the referee rings the bell/Until both your eyes start to swell/Until the crowd goes home/What we gonna do y’all?/Give em hell, turn their heads/Gonna live life ’til we’re dead./Give me scars, give me pain/Then they’ll say to me, say to me, say to me/There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter/Here comes the fighter/That’s what they’ll say to me, say to me, say to me/This one’s a fighter.”* Which is summed up perfectly, methinks in the slideshow I’ve added at the end of her guest post.] Guest Post by SCAR Girl Lauren As a healthy and active young woman, I was under the impression or, in hindsight the delusion, that I was impervious to life-threatening illnesses or events. I simply believed that if I worked hard and was a good person that life would reciprocate in kind. So when I was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2009 at age twenty-eight, while my husband was on his second tour in Iraq, you could imagine that my naive “vie en rose” attitude quickly shattered. I was left asking the question “why?” Why had this happened to me given that breast cancer is considered an affliction of the post-menopausal woman? Had I done something wrong during my early years (an occasional drink too-many in college) or did I have some genetic component lurking in the family pool that I didn’t know about? But like so many women slapped in the face by cancer, I didn’t have much time to dwell on these feelings. A bilateral mastectomy on October 16 th quickly made me realize that shitty things can happen to good people and that there was simply no rationale for it. Looking into the mirror for the first time after my surgery was a truly humbling experience and visually captured, for me, what “surviving” cancer really meant. That whoever I once was, I would never physically be again, that my new corporeality was an altered one that I would have to get used to. Removing the gauze pads revealed swollen water-filled pseudo breasts and bruises around my incisions. I no longer had nipples, but in their place I had angry looking scars. The one on the right ran the length of my breast and curved up toward my armpit in a smirk, a fitting visage for the “diseased” betrayer of my body. The left breast had a small straight line, like a mute partner guilty by proxy. I also had drains protruding from under my arms, the bulbous grenade portion of which was cradled in a little fabric belt that was slung around my waist. I felt alien, ugly and more like some macabre B-movie octopus than a woman. As I inspected myself in the mirror, my husband drew warm water in the pink plastic basin they sent me home with from the hospital. He gingerly took the washcloth, soaped it up and helped to bathe me and wash my hair. I didn’t have the energy to do it myself. I couldn’t believe the spectacle I saw reflected back at me and I began to cry. I never had to depend on anyone for this kind of daily activity and yet here we were. I get that in our marriage vows we agreed to be there for one another in sickness and in health, but I never imagined that we would test the theory when we were so young. Extremely self-conscious, I wondered how Mark felt to see my body reduced to something unfamiliar and bizarrely reconstructed. How could he find me attractive anymore when I was so changed, having lost those attributes which society deems so intrinsically feminine and esthetic? While such thoughts may seem superficial, addressing the feelings surrounding the physical alterations of my treatment really forced me to reexamine who I was aside from societal standards of beauty and worth. And though it has been a long and particularly emotional struggle to come to terms with my post-cancer body, what I’ve learned on my expedition through illness has been liberating and transformative – especially when it comes to David Jay’s The Scar Project. I randomly navigated to the website one afternoon, curious as to what breast reconstruction looked like for other women my age. The first portrait I came to was this stunning image of a pregnant woman with a deep scar in place of her right breast, her fair skin radiantly contrasted against a dark backdrop. I remember how strong and unapologetic she looked. “This is who I am” she seemed to say to me from the screen of my laptop. At that moment, hope blossomed. I, who have yet to have children or to learn if that’s even feasible at this point, could now imagine the possibility that cancer had not usurped the opportunity of motherhood from me because there was Emily, as bold and brave as an Amazon, defying cancer and not only living life but creating it too! Her strength and courage, along with the photos and stories of other SCAR models (a shout out to Vanessa, the two Saras, Eliza, and Barbie) have inspired me to participate in the Project so that I too can do my part to increase awareness of young women’s vulnerability to breast cancer. I consider it an honor to be a SCAR model; that photo shoot with David meant so much to me. For the first time in a long time, I felt beautiful and actually portrayed as who I truly am. I’ve since realized that my scars are not damaging scarlet letters of disease and imperfection so much as they are physical testimonials of my journey upon this earth. My experience with The SCAR Project has not only facilitated the acceptance of my wounds (physical and emotional) to find the beauty, grace and peace from within, it has also allowed me to transform my breast cancer into something powerful that will impact others. Whether that means showing young women with breast cancer that they are not alone in their experience or illustrating what reconstruction can look like – it definitely affirms that the reality of breast cancer has nothing to do with pink ribbons, commercialism, or walking until doomsday. All you have to do is look into a SCAR model’s eyes to grasp what reality is for the women photographed and to sense the collective frustration that we need to find a damn cure already. While I love my fellow SCAR sisters, there are already too many of us (including women in their teens, early twenties and thirties we’ve lost to this disease) for society to maintain the status quo of what they call breast cancer “awareness.” This slideshow requires JavaScript.",1,1,0.14086794282106782
5,10,14,[Timestamp('2013-01-26 00:00:00')],"[Follow-up guest post and recap of The SCAR BAMA Exhibition. This article is posted with permission from SCAR girl Sara’s blog and that link can be found HERE.] by Sara Bartosiewicz-Hamilton It has been over a week since I got back…it has taken me this long to try to digest it. I think I have been avoiding it because I am left with so many questions and so many hopes…and yet I know the reality of the situation as well. I apologize in advance for the bouncing around that is about to occur. You’ll get two gold stars if you follow me to the end… I honestly did not plan to go to the exhibit in Birmingham, Alabama. It was three weeks after my extraction. Before my surgery, I assumed I wouldn’t be ready to be in front of people…after surgery, I thought I wouldn’t be feeling well enough to go. But then, Billy posted in the SCAR girls page that he had just booked tickets for himself and Vanessa. I should have known in that moment. I first met Billy and Vanessa in Cincinnati. Billy is the ultimate host and Vanessa is the epitome of glamour. Hubby and I talked on the way home how we wished we lived closer because we enjoyed their company so much. Who doesn’t love a couple who hike all over the city trying to find you food, only to have to pack up and hit a White Castle and have lots of laughs while doing it! It was shortly after the exhibit that Vanessa started to decline in health, her cancer had returned and had spread to the lining in her brain…and then her brain. Live Sincerely party on the Purple People Bridge Vanessa has a motto – live sincerely. She started posting more and more about this motto, what this means. She and her sisters developed a website. And then she invited everyone to a Live Sincerely party on the Purple People Bridge. To be honest, I wasn’t sure what to expect that day. Vanessa was going through treatments…major treatments. I am quite certain I was one of those lame people who talked louder so she could understand me because that was so helpful…and I was uncomfortable with both Vanessa and Billy, unsure of what to say, and kind of hung out in the background. In reality, I was struggling with a few things that day. But that day was a turning point for me. I was truly trying to take one day at a time and was still having a hard time doing so. Watching the interactions and the love…watching the intent. It moved me deeply. Live Sincerely – spelled out in luminaries In the fall, the same gallery that hosted the SCAR project hosted Angelo Merendino and his exhibit, The Battle We Didn’t Choose. Vanessa had traveled to Cleveland and loved the exhibit and Angelo. It was brought to the gallery for her birthday. It was so special to watch Vanessa. It was hard not to notice the obvious connection between Vanessa and the exhibit. It seemed as though Vanessa was showing the rest of us what daily life might be looking like for her and Billy. I talked with Vanessa about what her favorite photo was…her all pink accessorized outfit…Live Sincerely (of course)…and watched her delight as she looked down to see the luminaries spelling out her motto. The beautiful birthday girl What do you get a birthday girl who is Stage IV and trying to show the rest of us how to embrace life and live sincerely? I couldn’t come up with a great idea so I came up with a dumb one instead…a life size Hello Kitty balloon. I was kind of worried it would scare her…thankfully, it didn’t and thankfully it didn’t terrify their dog and I found out in Birmingham Hello Kitty is still going…not too strong but her head is still inflated…um, that’s three or four months later?!? That’s the best dumb birthday gift I’ve ever come up with. I will be honest…every trip I have gone on, I prepare myself that this will probably be the last time I get to see Vanessa. I go into it thinking this and I think this is why I become so awkward around her. I don’t want her to know I am thinking this…so I act like a kid trying to hide something naughty they have done. This trip, it was different. Maybe, I am different. Since that day on the Purple People Bridge, I have challenged myself to think differently. To truly see the blessings, no matter how big or small, around me. To truly live in the moment, not in the past, not in the future…live in the present. So, for me, although at that moment I didn’t realize there was a shift in my brain, I saw Billy’s post and saw an opportunity to spend precious time with someone who has tremendously impacted my view on the world. It also seemed fairly miraculous in itself – I cried when the DC exhibit had been postponed because, in all sincerity, I thought it would be the last exhibit Vanessa would have been able to attend. So, here was the Birmingham exhibit and Vanessa and Billy were going. I woke up the Friday before with a sense of needing to be in Birmingham. I am incredibly thankful I listen to my spirit…I am incredibly thankful for a husband who supports me listening to my spirit. Vanessa & me with Flat Jolene My mission in Birmingham: Project Vanessa. I took the opportunity to be with Billy and Vanessa seriously…as serious as one can be when Billy is in the room. I felt incredibly blessed to be in the same state as them for multiple days, let alone the same hotel. And, lest anyone become concerned I was stalking them…well, I kind of was? But it seemed like they were both fairly okay with it. When I first saw Vanessa in Birmingham, she looked so healthy. Yes, I see she looks different than when I first met her but she also seemed less tired or worn down than when I have seen her this past year. It took me by surprise, actually. And it made me pause…I had already been struggling with my thoughts. Over the past year, as I mentioned, I kept seeing Vanessa and thinking it was the last time I would see her. I began to consider that I was counting her out and she is still here. It frustrated me…I don’t want to do that…and I know Vanessa wouldn’t want me to do that. It reminds me of a time in high school. I was brought to a hospital about an hour from where I lived…I was brought there to say goodbye to an aunt who had ovarian cancer. I was too young to remember how long she was in that hospital or how long it took but my aunt is alive and well today. And I began to wonder…why have I stopped believing in miracles? Why have I automatically assumed it won’t happen? I know I believed it couldn’t…I am unsure what I believe today. He was supposed to be taking the photo of Vanessa and me…BILLY! Vanessa was anxious to get to the gallery…we all were. Unfortunately, my group got a bit…well….lost. So, by the time we made it, Vanessa and Billy were on the hunt for food…Project Vanessa was not going well! (I just wondered, perhaps Billy had his own covert mission: operation avoid me!!) It was probably a good thing my group was so late…it made it much easier to find a spot to hide as I cried. It is a regular thing for me…surrounded by the beauty and strength of my SCAR sisters photos resorts me to tears. This time, it was a bit different because I feel different…as if those sisters are the only ones who truly can understand where I stand today…and a bit of gratitude mixed in…sensing I was exactly where I was meant to be in that moment. Thankfully for me (and Project Vanessa) some of us met for dinner. I made myself a nuisance and sat directly across from Vanessa and Billy. It was the first of many conversations Vanessa and I (and Billy) had over the weekend. Yes, there were times where she repeated a story…like telling me about the leg warmers she was excited to have for the exhibit and thought she had misplaced. But it didn’t bother her when she asked me if she had told me about it yet and I answered honestly, yes. We just moved on. I watched as she took pictures…I don’t know how to describe it. It would seem almost like an OCD behavior but, at the same time, she was okay if she was encouraged to just stay in her seat and relax. I got to hear about her trip to Ten Thousand Villages to purchase ornaments for her nephews. She was so excited as she told me the process of picking them out (and getting to go in the back room to see the ones not on the floor yet) and how special it would be as they open them up even when she is no longer here. Yes, she openly says this…and, in a way, it was a relief – acknowledging this humongous elephant in the room. And, yet, we just moved on. I explained how I do the same thing with my kids – a special ornament every year and how they love it…every year, they are most excited to unwrap the ornaments that are their’s and hang them on the tree. Vanessa said she hopes it will be the same for her nephews. Selfishly, I was relieved when she called me by name. Over the past year, I have assumed Vanessa didn’t know who I was. Yes, I met her before her health deteriorated but it isn’t as if we spent a lot of time together then. I have interacted with her over the internet but it isn’t the same. She has had a lot going on, she has been through a lot, it would have seemed totally normal to me if one day she looked at me and asked me who I was and why do I insist on following her around. So, to hear her say, Sara….it meant a lot…priceless, actually. Bacon lollipops – Vanessa gave them two thumbs up! The rest of the time, I just followed Billy and Vanessa’s lead. We ate breakfast together at the hotel. I got to see how Vanessa’s tastebuds might be a bit…off. It reminded me of the movie Elf (and yes, I told Vanessa and Billy this). Where Buddy (the Elf) puts syrup on spaghetti and is addicted to sugar. Vanessa made hot chocolate and then put sugar and cream in it. She ate waffles and needed cinnamon and sugar and syrup in each of the squares (actually, I have been known to try to have the same ratio with waffles and syrup). While Vanessa was eating her waffles, she talked about all kinds of things. I got to hear about the first time she met Billy…she talked about her wedding day and how Billy may come by being a smart alec quite naturally. It was so special to hear about all these memories Vanessa has…and interesting to watch her remember them but not quite remember if she had told me about those leg warmers yet. At one of the breakfast dates, I asked Vanessa if I could look through her camera. After watching her at dinner, I knew her card must be overflowing. I wanted to get a glimpse at what she is thinking about, what is catching her eye. She graciously allowed me to look. It was fairly remarkable. I got to see the last several weeks of her life…some pictures that reminded me of the tag project but there were so many others that, well, they kind of took my breath away. What I saw must be what day to day life looks like when you actually pay attention. The details of a room…the artwork, the flower arrangements, the colors. The things we do to “finish” a look but then never pay attention to them again. Vanessa and Billy had gone to a restaurant called the Mellow Mushroom. Vanessa took all these photos of all these things in the restaurant. I went to the restaurant later in the weekend and it took me a bit to realize, I am sitting among Vanessa’s photos. She also had photos of an iron, standing up, laying down. Pictures like that. But I enjoyed the opportunity to see where her brain is at right now and watching it unfold in her pictures. I tried not to pry. I asked how she slept, I would ask Billy how he was doing. When I got the canned answers, I let it be. I offered to take Vanessa with me to the store, I understood when the answer was she probably wasn’t up for it. I wanted to help and understood that helping might be just being present when asked. And I enjoyed every moment I could, listening to Vanessa, talking with her, helping her. It was beautiful. Vanessa reading her speech – that’s me holding the poster she made I watched with pride as Vanessa read her speech to the guests at the gala. Vanessa and I talked multiple times about how she didn’t want anyone to be upset she was reading her speech. She had written it beforehand because she wanted to be sure she remembered everything she wanted to say. I reassured her multiple times, people want to hear from you, they aren’t going to care that you are reading it. I was so happy when she gifted our new SCAR sister Leah with the Live Sincerely poster she had made. Vanessa was so excited about it. When I was arriving in Birmingham, Billy had texted me they were at a UPS making this poster. Vanessa had told me multiple times she would not be able to get it home and she wanted to leave it in Alabama with one of the local SCAR sisters. In fact, Vanessa was a bit concerned after her speech and after she explained she was giving Leah her poster that no one was coming up to take their pictures with it. Was Vanessa unaware of the people around her crying? the impact her speech had? I was too focused on holding that poster and listening to her speech and willing myself to think only about what was happening in the moment but I knew everyone was incredibly moved and just needed a minute to recover. Don’t worry, they will…they just need a minute. (And if you did, please make Vanessa’s day and go post your photos at her website!) Even as I have been writing and rewriting this post…I have had a mix of laughter and tears. Much like the bitter-sweetness of the weekend, though, thankfully, I contained my tears to the one time at the gallery. Being thankful Vanessa was there, being slapped back to reality to hear Billy say it may just be him at the next exhibit. I don’t have a grand finale for this post. In my mind, I still have many questions that may never be answered. Yes, I think about the miracle that occurred in my aunt’s life and I am now praying for the same miracle in Vanessa’s life. At the same time, I comprehend, as much as I am able to, how grim the situation is. Vanessa has cancer in her brain that is growing. The miracle of restored health, it might not happen. I am beginning to realize giving up on the belief of miracles may be a way in which to protect myself when it doesn’t come to fruition. Much like I have approached the times I have seen Vanessa over the past year as the “last time”. Because, if I prepare myself, it won’t hurt as much? In essence, it created a barrier between us and I am immensely thankful that barrier was not in Birmingham. Perhaps, the weekend in Birmingham was the ultimate lesson in Vanessa’s guide to Live Sincerely. I got to spend an incredible time with her (and Billy) but I had to live sincerely doing it. There were no tears over Vanessa, there was no guarantee of a next time. It was living sincerely in the moment and being thankful for that moment. Clowning with my sisters Vanessa~ Thank you…from the bottom of my heart and soul, thank you. I love you~Sara Updated to include a link to The Live Sincerely Project post in which Vanessa’s sister, Jessica, mentions part of my post. It is a great post that touches some of the same feelings I have…but be sure to check out the family photos at the end – hilarious!",1,1,0.18698041285479713

19,10,4,[Timestamp('2012-06-13 00:00:00')],"[After Jolene’s Mom, Denise VonMillanich, and Flat Jolene’s special guest appearances at the SCAR Project LA cocktail party kick-off fundraiser last month, quite a few people asked about Jolene’s S.C.A.R. story. Her recent passing in October reminded us all that the absolute reality of cancer is that not everyone survives. It is a horrid, hateful disease that does not care if you are only 17 years old, like Jolene was, when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer. It does not care if you are only twenty-freaking-five when you lay down your pink boxing gloves and go to your rest in peace after kicking cancer’s ass for 9 years, like Jolene did. Cancer does not give a rip if it’s 2 weeks before your 26th birthday and you have plane tickets to NYC to The SCAR Project exhibition, where your portrait is hanging, and your SCAR sisters are all waiting to hang with you, as was the case with Jolene’s passing. Cancer does not care. But we do. And we remember Jolene. We will always remember and love you, beautiful Jolene.] As a fitting tribute to Jolene, hers was the last portrait taken down after the NYC exhibition. The flowers are from her friends who had travelled there to be with her, and from her SCAR sisters. Rest in peace, sweet Jolene. This very special guest post was written by Jolene Von Millanich. It is her story, in her own words. Although we know the end of her cancer story and that she is resting in paradise, as her brother puts it, or causing chaos among all the angels, as one of her friends posted on her Facebook wall… Jolene’s story is far from over. Her SCAR portraits, her memory, her mama, all those of us who love her, and Flat Jolene, continue kicking cancer’s ass and taking names, fighting like our girl Jolene. My Neverending Cancer Story by Jolene Von Millanvich So, a lot of people have asked me to share my story about my fight with cancer. I decided to write it here so anyone and everyone can read it. Just to warn you, it is long, but here it goes. When I was 17, I felt my first lump in my right breast. I ignored it for months until I finally went in for my annual exam and the nurse practitioner felt it. She immediately freaked out and referred me to a surgeon who ordered an ultrasound. I was like . . . “What is this bitch getting me into? I’m TOO young for this to be cancer!” I went and got the ultrasound and we found out that it was solid and not a cyst like everyone thought. After that, I went to the surgeon and he gave me the option to either have a biopsy or get it removed. I decided to get it removed. So in July of 2003, I had my first lumpectomy. A few weeks went by and I didn’t hear anything about my results so we figured that no news was good news. I started college to become a medical assistant and after my first day of school, I came home to find my surgeon sitting on my couch with my family! OMG, talk about house calls! He explained to me that my results took so long to come back because they had to send the pathology to Stanford since no one at the local hospital knew what it was. He then told me my diagnosis was a Phyllodes tumor. He said that before me, he had never even heard of it. It was borderline malignant and he didn’t get clean margins. His understanding from what he read about it was that it would be best to do a single mastectomy followed by radiation, then reconstruction. Being a 17 year old girl, my boobs were my best friends! I couldn’t imagine walking around with only one boob. What an idiot! If only I knew back then what I know now!! The surgeon decided to send me to a specialist at the UC Davis Cancer Center who had seen Phyllodes before. The specialist advised that a mastectomy wasn’t needed and we’d take the wait and see approach. In October of 2003, I had my second lumpectomy to get clear margins and remove the second borderline malignant Phyllodes tumor from the right breast. After that, we did follow up visits every 3 months for a while. Eventually, it went to every 6 months and I was clear for about a year and a half. In February of 2005, when I was 19, I had my third lumpectomy for another borderline Phyllodes tumor. My doctor still didn’t pursue the mastectomy because he felt that it wasn’t going to turn malignant and wanted to preserve my breasts due to my young age. June of 2008 rolled around and my doctor retired and my insurance changed, so I had to find a different Surgical Oncologist. Of course, I slacked on that until I felt a lump in my left breast in October of 2008. I found a really great surgeon and he did a lumpectomy that December. Immediately after that lumpectomy, I started to feel a lump in my right breast. It was pretty big by the time I got into to see my surgeon and at that time we decided that I was done getting lumpectomies every few years and it was time to do the double mastectomy. My new surgeon couldn’t get me scheduled until February of 2009 for the double mastectomy. By that time, my tumor was 11CM; the size of a softball. I had grown out of my B-Cup bra and even out of a C-Cup bra. I thought my boob was going to explode! It was so painful!! The pathology report from my mastectomy showed that the tumor in my right breast was, in fact, now a malignant Phyllodes tumor. My left breast had more Phyllodes tumors and DCIS. Jolene’s gift for her friend Trish. The picture speaks for itself. This is where the fun began! A PET scan was ordered and revealed hot spots in my right lung, right shoulder, a lymph node in my right armpit, and a lymph node in my right groin. My oncologist ordered a bone biopsy in my right shoulder because that was the easiest one to biopsy. That came back as a rare benign lesion. Then we decided to biopsy the lymph node in my right groin. Unfortunately, they didn’t get a good enough sample. The biopsy was inconclusive. My oncologist decided that since the bone biopsy was negative for cancer, the other spots weren’t cancer, either. What a mistake. I went back to work and went on with my normal life. About 4 months later, I had a repeat PET scan. It showed the spots were getting bigger. The lymph node biopsy was repeated, and what do you know, it came back positive for Phyllodes. My oncologist diagnosed me as Stage IV and referred me to a Sarcoma specialist at UCSF because he had never seen this kind of cancer. I started chemo in October of 2009. I did Doxorubucin (aka Adriamycin, the Red Devil) and Ifosamide and had to be admitted to the hospital at UCSF for 6 days for each treatment. I completed 3 rounds of this protocol and had another PET scan. It showed that the cancer was unresponsive. So, in Febuary of 2010, I started Taxotere combined with another chemo that I can’t remember the name of right now. LOL! After 3 rounds of that protocol, I had a PET scan and it revealed it was working!! Yay!! My oncologist and I decided to do 3 more rounds. After completing the first round of this three, I noticed the right side of my lips were really, really numb. My local oncologist ordered a CT of my brain which came back normal. About 3 weeks later, I noticed what I thought was an abscess in my mouth where I had 2 molars removed the year before. I went to the dentist and got x-rays done and they said it wasn’t an abscess but a cyst or a tumor and it was sitting on my nerve in my jaw which was causing the numbness in my lips. It started getting bigger and bigger and was really starting to get painful. I was, FINALLY, referred to an ENT oncologist at UCSF and he did a biopsy. The biopsy revealed a sarcoma. I, of course, assumed it was another Phyllodes. I would find out at a later date that I was wrong. On June 24, 2010, I had the right side of my jaw removed and reconstructed with my Fibula and a steel rod. I was in surgery for 15 hours and the ICU for 9 days, but I only remember 3 of them. LOL! All together, I was in the hospital for 2 weeks. The tumor measured 7 cm and grew that big in only 7 weeks!! Jolene and her friend Mary after her jaw surgery. In August, I learned that the tumor was a whole different kind of sarcoma. So I’ve had 3 different kinds of cancer and they’re planning on testing me for Li-Fraumeni Syndrome next month. It’s a genetic disorder that increases your chances of getting different kinds of cancers and, usually, affects kids and young adults. I started a clinical trial at UCSF the beginning of this month. It’s a mixture of Avastin, Taxol, and a brand new drug that doesn’t even have a name yet. I have to go to San Francisco every week for eight weeks. Then we’ll do another PET scan. I’m praying that this works!! Third time’s a charm, right?!? I can’t wait to just be done with this and get on with my life cancer free!! [Addendum: Jolene’s chondrosarcoma in her jaw recurred before the end of 2010. About a month later, she was advised the genetic testing for Li Fraumeni (genetic syndrome) was positive and she underwent another grueling 18 hour surgery in April 2011 almost identical to the surgery she had in June of 2010. More of Jolene’s jaw was taken and rebuilt. A couple of months after that jaw surgery, it was determined that Jolene had two chondrosarcoma tumors growing in her sinus cavity/brain. Jolene underwent surgery to debulk those tumors and relieve some of her pain. After that surgery, Jolene (with the support of her family) decided to enter hospice care and live a life of quality over quantity. Jolene spent the last three months of her life making memories with her family and friends.] And here are a few of those friends remembering Jolene at The SCAR Project Exhibition.",1,1,0.11863913606969169

Bravo to Style Network’s Taylor Hennessy, “Baring It All” Co-producers Nicola Bates and Patty Zagarella (also director and filmmaker), and SCAR Project Photographer David Jay for the win! “Baring It All” follows fashion photographer David Jay, into the worlds of four young breast cancer survivors, exploring their journeys and being photographed for the SCAR Project. “Baring It All” portrays what: [Surviving Cancer. Absolute Reality.] Is really all about, for them (and for the more than 10,000 young women like them, who are diagnosed each year). “Baring It All” uncovers what’s beneath the pink ribbons. To view trailers for Baring It All click here and here. In the rolling out of the red carpet for Saturday night’s Emmy’s, I interviewed “Baring It All” filmmaker Patricia Zagarella. So without further ado, how about some lights, camera…and action (cue up the first question, enter Patricia Zagarella for the answer parts): Q: First of all, congrats and namaste on the Emmy, Patty! How cool is it to win an Emmy for a passion project like The SCAR Project?! A: This is the most incredible honor BUT the award really belongs to all the courageous young women who participated and to David Jay. Q: How did you find out about The SCAR Project? A: David Jay and I have a mutual friend, who was visiting NY from Australia. She randomly bumped into David while on her visit and he told her about the Scar Project. She then sent me a link and my co-producer, Nicola and I, were blown away by the photographs – the beauty and the pain, every image and every woman’s eyes screamed a different story we wanted to learn more. Q: What inspired you to start filming the documentary? A: When I first saw the SCAR Project I was captivated by the raw reality conveyed by his photos. Striking and beautiful, yet confronting and almost brutal, they pushed me to a place I normally contentedly avoided. I was both shocked and saddened, but drawn to the images like a magnet. Despite that the photos spoke volumes, I had a barrage of questions screaming in my head, not only about the young women in the photographs but also about the photographer: Who was he? Why was a successful fashion and beauty photographer photographing young breast cancer survivors? Why did he embark on this journey and what motivates him to continue? Fascinated, I reached out to David Jay – who reached back with enthusiasm and warmth. I then met a genuinely kind and caring man, whose world had been turned upside down when confronted by a close friend’s body after a mastectomy. He told me that he dealt with it the only way he knew how, by taking her picture. And the rest is history. Q: Can you describe the process, and the emotions of filming such painful images? (ones that most breast cancer patients haven’t seen before they have a mastectomy–hopefully The SCAR Project will change that.) A: We were an all female team during the photo shoot sessions, our goal was to be unobtrusive and document the event, what we experienced was a palpable transformation taking place before us. Women would come to the door broken and nervous and by the time they left, they had a renewed sense of pride, hope and strength. Every single woman exuded beauty that came from her resolve and attitude, which David captured perfectly. It was a very special experience, albeit a tough one, being able to capture this transformation, to be able to share in the anguish, the pain, the tears and the laughter. Q: What were some of the hi-los of filming this project? What surprised you most about filming “Baring It All”? A: Meeting and spending time with these amazing, strong young women has been an incredible high. I have been touched in a profound way by all the women we met, and I’ve learned so much from them – celebrate life and live in the moment. I remind myself of that daily. The lows have obviously come when confronted with beautiful young girls struggling to beat this horrible disease. What surprised me most was the enlightened attitude of such young women and their strength in the face of their mortality. Q: How did you get into filming? A: I started working in TV & film in Australia after graduating from University. My first job was working at a TV station and it just went from there. Q: What do you consider your particular calling in the film industry to be? A: I enjoy producing, finding compelling stories and character, and then finding the right team to execute that story. I really love meeting people and learning about them, and under the pretense of filmmaking I get to ask lots of questions most people are afraid to. Q: What other film work have you done? A: I started working in narrative features, but then about 7 years ago I was presented with the opportunity to co-produce a documentary, and from that point on I was hooked. I loved telling real stories by real people. Who needs a script, real life is far more compelling, heart-warming, and heartbreaking. Q: The doc was originally titled “Don’t look away”? How did it go from there to “Baring It All?” A: The doc was originally titled “Don’t Look Away”, a title Nicola my co-producer came up with. We decided on that title early on because people’s initial reaction at hearing about the subject and photos was to look away. The entire message and point of the project was to remove the stigma and normalize something that so many women undergo but no one ever sees or talks about. We wanted people to look at the photos, look at the women, at the scars, and at their eyes. The name was changed when the Style Network came on board as they felt that “Don’t Look Away” didn’t adequately describe what the film was about. After much back and forth, we settled on “Baring It All” as the new title. Q: How did the Style Network come on board with the documentary? A: Two great women, Beth and Andrea from Remarkable Content took my trailer to the Style Network about a year before they actually came on board. The VPs at Style thought it was an important story to tell and one that their viewers could connect with, however one-off documentaries were completely out of the realm of their usual programming that it just didn’t work. They came back to me about a year after our initial conversation and the VPs had come up with an over-brand series called Style Exposed, which would include one-off documentaries. “Baring It All” is the first in the Style Exposed series. Hopefully tonight’s success for Style compels and propels them to continue to produce one-off documentaries with heart. Q: Is the documentary available on DVD? A: The DVDs are available through Amazon. The SCAR Project, Volume 1 book is also available on Amazon. Q: How would you articulate the message you hope people get when they view your doc and the SCAR Project? A: I want people to see that there is true beauty in strength and hope in the face of despair. There’s power in optimism and it’s ok to have scars and to look at them and let people see them. In line with the SCAR Project message, the goal is to raise awareness and let people know that young women can and do get breast cancer. Early detection is the best prevention, therefore the more people who see the film or the SCAR Project photos the bigger the impact. Q: How can people follow you, support the amazing things you are doing like this documentary? A: People can keep up to date with my work via my website atwww.lostinvision.com or via Facebook. Q: What are you doing next? A: I’m developing a project that deals with alternatives to incarceration, with a focus on young women who are at risk, and we hope to help transform their lives before it’s too late. Q: I have to ask… did you sleep with the Emmy? I mean… who wouldn’t? A: LOL those wings are spiky! It was a night to remember! I’m on cloud 9 and SO PROUD of everyone involved with The SCAR Project & Baring It All, especially the amazing, powerful and beautiful young women living the reality of breast cancer, thank you for sharing your stories. Q: Not really a question, but I’d just like to thank Patricia for a brilliant interview and also say “go break a leg!” in re: the “Baring It All” award at the Emmys this Saturday night. And I’ll just go ahead and say BRAVO! because I know it’s going to, as The SCAR Project intends: Raise public consciousness of early-onset breast cancer, raise funds for breast cancer research/outreach programs and help young survivors see their scars, faces, figures and experiences through a new, honest and ultimately empowering lens. So kudos Patricia. Cheers and kudos. I’d also like to give a little shout out to Cincy SCAR girl Vanessa Tiemeier’s sister, Christina Blust, whose music plays the soundtrack to her sister’s SCAR story in Baring It All.

24,10,9,[Timestamp('2012-07-18 00:00:00')],"When the international SCAR Project exhibition premieres in Washington, DC this October, kicking off Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2012 from our Nation’s Capitol, the timing couldn’t be more perfect if it tried. Besides pulling the proverbial pink carpet out from under October, the DC exhibition is also smack dab in the heat of election season. “In the end, by bringing The SCAR Project to our city, we hope to make a strong statement about breast cancer by showing our country what it really looks like,” said Donna Guinn Kaufman, breast cancer survivor, former vice-president of the Tigerlily Foundation (supports young women before, during and after BC) and founder of the Kill the Cancer Beast Foundation (empowering people with cancer to fight), the organization spearheading production of The SCAR Project DC Exhibition. “We hope that The SCAR Project will change the way that people look at this disease, seeing it for what it is, terrifying, disfiguring and deadly, and as such, take real action to end it.” Last month Kaufman and her planning committee of mostly survivors and previvors kicked things into high gear toward that end at their SCAR Project DC Exhibition Kickoff Fundraiser which was held at The Dunes art gallery. (Thank you for your gracious hosting of the event, Deidree Bennett, Fine Arts Director at The Dunes.) This slideshow requires JavaScript. (Thank you to all the photographers who covered the event: Kipp Burgoyne, Marcus Bennett, Diane Crawford, Joey Darley, and Mayrev Mary Goren for all your lovely photos. And a special thank you goes out to Kristen Berset, WUSA9 sports anchor and reporter for her graceful emceeing of the event. Also to WUSA9 weekday morning anchor Andrea Roane for her gracious support of The SCAR Project DC Exhibition.) If I were writing notes on cocktail napkins during the SCAR DC kickoff fundraiser, here’s a few of the highlights I’d have scribbled down: Breast cancer is a political issue – SCAR DC Producer Donna Guinn Kaufman Breast cancer is not prejudiced – SCAR girl Heather Salazar (caucasian) adopted her friend’s daughter after her friend (African-American) passed away from breast cancer. Then Heather was also diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer does not wait until you are “old enough to get breast cancer” – SCAR girl Eliza Hewitt who was diagnosed last year at age 22. Breast cancer does not care if you are in a wheelchair because you already have Cerebral Palsy. – SCAR girl Sara Boghdan. Breast cancer is not very patriotic. – SCAR girl Marathon Barbie the Marine who was diagnosed while serving our country in Afghanistan. Breast cancer does not play fair. -SCAR girl Darcie who shared recent news of her breast cancer’s progression. (Cheers to your health, love, and godspeed beautiful Darcie, as you strive for stable disease once more.) Breast cancer may SCAR but it does not define those who’ve stared down its ugly face and face their own absolute realities of surviving cancer. And yet, get a bunch of these crazy ass kicking cancer chicks in a room together sharing their SCARs and all I can say is cancer better watch out. One of these chicks is a marine and the rest of the women in the room have her back. With that said, here’s the drill for the SCAR Project DC Exhibition: October 1, the first day of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Kaufman is organizing a “Young Women Surviving Breast Cancer Day on Capitol Hill.” Kaufman is arranging meetings for any young women who can make the event to meet with their Senators and Representatives while young women in SCAR DC t-shirts deliver invites for The SCAR Project DC Exhibition to members of Congress and and their staff on Capitol Hill. Monday evening, The SCAR Project DC will host a VIP Reception/Press Conference by invitation only from 6:30 to 8 p.m. to kickoff the exciting week of DC Exhibition events and introduce The SCAR Project to the nation’s Capitol. The DC Exhibition will open to the public the same day October 1 and will run until October 7. General admission hours will be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (except for during ticketed gallery tours with the photographer, Monday evening VIP Reception/Press Conference and Thursday evening’s Black & White Opening Night Gala). The price of general admission is FREE. There will be daily gallery tours with SCAR Project Photographer David Jay, and when possible, various SCAR girls will be available for Q&A. Stay tuned for a schedule of gallery tours TBA. A Black & White Opening Night Gala will be held on October 4. Tickets must be purchased in advance on the Eventbrite link below. A special discounted price is offered for a pair of tickets purchased before September 1. Also a special “Buy a Ticket for a Survivor” at a discounted price is offered so no survivor who wants to go to the gala is left behind. On October 5 after the gallery closes for the day there will be a special ticketed After Hours Party with the SCAR crowd. On October 6 Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Patricia Zagarella will be on hand for a special screening of her EMMY Award-winning SCAR Project documentary, Baring It All. Zagarella, David Jay, and a few of the SCAR girls will be available for a Q&A session afterward. Tickets for all events are now LIVE on Eventbrite-Click HERE.

26,15,1,[Timestamp('2013-10-27 00:00:00')],"If you tuned into a National Football League game during the last month, you surely noticed that there was pink everywhere, from the gear worn by the players and coaches right down to the penalty flags. The stadiums are pink, the fields are pink. Even the goalposts are pink. The raison d'etre of all this pink is the NFL's annual effort to raise money and awareness as part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. But while finding a cure for breast cancer would, of course, be a scientific victory for the ages, it's worth questioning how much good the NFL is actually doing. Is it really advancing the cause or just ""pinkwashing,"" the term used to describe businesses that employ Breast Cancer Awareness Month to bolster their own bottom lines? (The Better Business Bureau actually issued a general warning for consumers to be on the lookout for pinkwashing scams.) According to an analysis by Business Insider, just 8 percent of the money spent on the plethora of pink gear being sold by the NFL actually winds up going towards cancer research at the American Cancer Society, the supposed beneficiary of the league's efforts. Since 2009, when pink first appeared on the field, the NFL has donated a grand total of $4.5 million towards the cause, while the league made $9 billion (that's billion, with a b) in revenue last year alone. As Business Insider's Cork Gaines wrote, ""if the point is to actually help fight cancer, fans would have a much bigger impact if they skipped the NFL and donated directly to the ACS or other organizations working to fight cancer."" But an unclear picture regarding the distribution of funds is not the only reason the NFL's pink October is so maddening. Another is its elevation of one disease to the explicit exclusion of all others. Nothing symbolized that situation more perfectly than Chicago Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall and his green shoes. Marshall, who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, wanted to wear green kicks during a game on October 10 in support of Mental Health Awareness Week, which ran from October 6 to 12. The NFL fined him $10,500 for violating uniform protocol (a fine which Marshall happily paid and then matched with a donation to charity). The NFL is so pink-centric that one player wearing a pair of shoes for a different cause was seen as something worthy of punishment. Initially, the league even looked to prevent Marshall from playing entirely if he sported the green shoes, before relenting and settling on just a fine. And mental health isn't the only cause steamrolled by the pink NFL juggernaut. ""I was pretty sure we were toast,"" said Rita Smith, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, upon first seeing the NFL go pink. ""There was no way we were ever gonna match them."" The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence also uses October as its awareness month, with purple being its color of choice. As Ann Friedman noted in New York Magazine, domestic violence will actually affect more women than breast cancer, but attempts to prevent the former are losing fundraising ground to the latter, in large part due to the pinkification of October that gets a serious boost from the NFL's efforts. By focusing solely on breast cancer year after year – and by making its campaign mostly about raising the ever-ambiguous ""awareness"" of the disease, as if something affecting hundreds of thousands of women is somehow a secret – while sending little in the way of real funds towards research, how much good the NFL is doing is an open question. Is all this ""awareness"" actually worth anything? And if it is, why not try to highlight a lesser known set of diseases next year, or perhaps a problem that is not even medical? (Though I will admit, the fact that conservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh is enraged by NFL players wearing pink makes me like the whole thing a bit more.) None of this is meant to diminish the very real horror of breast cancer or to undermine the monumental effort that goes into combating it. Plus, at the end of the day, every dollar the NFL puts towards cancer research is one more dollar that might have gone somewhere else had it not been for the league's efforts. But the evidence seems to show that there's more sound than fury when it comes to the league's actual financial support in the fight against the disease. In the meantime, other worthy causes get buried under an avalanche of pink that mostly lets people feel good about ""supporting"" the quest against breast cancer with minimal time or effort. And that's not good enough, if the ultimate goal is to find a real cure.",1,1,0.1088018202861953
27,16,1,[Timestamp('2011-10-07 00:00:00')],"After this past Sunday’s football game, a friend asked me if the NFL owned the shade of pink that everyone on the screen seemed to have so prominently displayed. Well, full disclosure, I didn’t watch on and I rarely do watch football – unless a party has been planned around the game, then I’m there, and I will make cupcakes decorated with your team colors and logo. Anyway, apparently everyone from players to coaches to referees was wearing pink to raise awareness of the importance of annual screenings for breast cancer, aka “A Crucial Catch.” I started thinking about the pink ribbon that has been engrained in our subconscious and if anyone owned the design mark. Of course, when you think “pink ribbon” your next thought is “Susan G. Komen.” Susan G. Komen For the Cure was the first to use pink ribbons in connection with breast cancer awareness when the organization handed out pink ribbons to participants in its NYC race for breast cancer survivors in the fall of 1991. It is rumored that the pink ribbon was inspired by the red ribbon for AIDS awareness, and used by Komen “when you couldn’t use the words ‘breast cancer’ in public.” Things of that nature have changed since the ‘90s – thanks Janet Jackson. It is also rumored that the pink ribbon is not owned by anyone, so you can slap the symbol on any product you want in an effort to participate in breast cancer awareness. That last part…it’s a little trickier. Organizations or individuals may have common law trademark rights in the ribbon, but a quick query on the USPTO’s TESS search engine generated 45 records for federal design marks featuring a ribbon and having the words “breast cancer” in the design description. However, all but one of the marks consisted of a word mark in addition to a design mark, such as DE-FEET BREAST CANCER WALK/RUN or LAW OF PINK FIGHTING TOGETHER. No search yielded only a pink ribbon design. A search for live design marks owned by Komen yielded 199 results, the most interesting one of which is this design mark: Komen does not own a design mark for a standalone pink ribbon. Like other organizations, Komen owns pink ribbon design marks that also consist of a word mark. The design mark above is the only mark Komen owns without a word mark combination and that looks similar to the original pink ribbon we all know today. This is the mark Komen currently uses to promote breast cancer awareness, and you can see the mark on several places on their website. So we know where the pink ribbon ownership stands, as least in terms of federal ownership. To answer the original question, the NFL does not own any federally registered marks related to breast cancer awareness – not the color pink and not even the phrase “A Crucial Catch.” Their support, like many organizations in October, is without federal trademark involvement. Even our own building is turning pink.",1,1,0.01494809203142536

29,18,1,[Timestamp('2012-06-11 00:00:00')],"Between the corporate marketing opportunities and the sheer number of people who want to do something — anything — that might alleviate the suffering they've seen, pink is big business. But somewhere between the first pink ribbon (created in the early 1990s according to Anna Holmes) and the Kentucky Fried Chicken partnership with the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, pink lost its way. The term ""pinkwashing"" began to show up, along with a campaign called ""think before you pink"". The public is finally pushing back against the relentless merchandising of this disease, as well as the myopic focus on ""awareness"" and the ever-elusive cure. What about preventing cancer through reduction of environmental carcinogens? What about improving quality of life for cancer patients? Today's patients can't prevent their cancers, and they probably won't live to see a cure, either. Enter ""Pink Ribbons Inc."" by Swiss/Canadian filmmaker Léa Pool. The documentary recently opened in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C., and will soon play other cities. It was made before the Planned Parenthood /Komen controversy. As Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday noted, ""The rhetoric surrounding the disease has become one of enforced cheerfulness, with patients converted into 'survivors' and 'warriors' — the implication being that anyone who dies from it just wasn’t fighting hard enough."" Exactly! Patients already have to carry the discomfort, grief, fear, pain and isolation of their disease. The ""cheer doctrine"" would also have them carry the guilt and shame of failing to cure cancer. Perhaps the first shot across the bow was the groundbreaking 2001 essay ""Welcome to Cancerland"" by breast cancer survivor Barbara Ehrenreich. Ehrenreich looks upon pink teddy bears with disdain, and observes that ""men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not receive gifts of Matchbox cars."" Almost a decade later came Siddhartha Mukherjee’s 2010 Pulitzer-Prize-winning ""The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer."" In an interview with The Guardian, Mukherjee said, ""A positive mental attitude does not cure cancer — any more than a negative mental attitude causes cancer."" I'm living proof that a positive attitude has no effect on cancer recurrence. I'm 10 years in remission from stage III ovarian cancer, and you could not have picked a worse candidate for such a challenge. I've often wished a more mature and optimistic woman could have gotten my cancer instead of me. Someone stronger. Someone happier. But cancer comes not to the woman you should be, but to the woman you are. The more focused and capable women have bad days too, of course, but it seems to me they have more tools in their bags of tricks. One worked tirelessly for a cancer awareness postage stamp and rode a bike across the country to raise funds — while I fantasized about suicide for the sole purpose of wrestling a little control away from the disease (""You can't fire me. I quit!"") As pathetic a coping mechanism as that was, it did get me through the first few years. And while I still don't believe in ghosts, I have become familiar with the concept. Beside me every day is the ghost of the woman I used to be. Then there are the ghosts of women who’ve died. When you live with ghosts, a hot pink boa might be just the ticket. Or a long walk with friends and family. A candle and a prayer. Or a joke. A cancer survivor finds a path, somehow. Limping, cursing, crying, laughing, we go on. Amid all the pink ribbon controversy, one Washington Post reader noted: ""I miss pink being just a color."" I do, too. I also miss peacefully drifting off to sleep. I realize chances are very good that I'll wake up again. But these days I find that I'm like a kid who doesn't want to miss anything.

I was stage IV right out of the gate – de novo. I hadn’t seen that coming and I felt I had lost all control over my life. I would be in treatments for as long as I lived (median survival after an MBC diagnosis is 3 years – a statistic that has not significantly improved in more than 20 years.) As most do, I turned to the Internet and researched everything I could find about MBC and what to expect. Once I had educated myself, I still felt this overwhelming sense of impotence. I joined Facebook groups and reached out to MBC organizations to figure out how to cope. These provided me with both a sense of community and reminded me that I was not alone in this. So many were in my same boat and had such great experiences and information to share. I spent many hours on the Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) site, as it had so many resources that were useful and informative. Jean Burns (right) with fellow Hear My Voice Volunteer Maura Bivens. I also signed up to go to LBBC’s Annual Conference for Women Living With Metastatic Breast Cancer held in Philadelphia in April 2015, because it sounded like a promising way to network with MBC healthcare professionals, patients, and advocates. I applied for the Hear My Voice: Metastatic Breast Cancer Outreach Program because I felt like this would be a chance for me to turn the feeling of impotence into something powerful and make an impact. The HMV program was new in 2015 and it promised the opportunity to get involved with promoting greater awareness around MBC, impact research funding for MBC, and generally put the reins back in my hands, so I felt I was doing something productive about my disease. I participated in the day-long training for the HMV advocates the Friday before the conference. It really provided a good foundation for what we wanted to do as a group. There were great brainstorming sessions and I soon realized that this group of advocates was a powerhouse that would have an important impact. We learned how to leverage our current skills (are you a good communicator, a whiz at Twitter, can you review research grants, etc.?) to advocate for MBC patients. Everyone had a niche and everyone fit into a role of some type. Each role was equally important, too. The exchange of ideas and information was breathtaking and gave me new energy and a sense of hope and inspiration. Some people attended a “die-in” at the end of the conference to physically represent the 113 people that die of MBC each day in the U.S. It was a powerful and poignant message. I got to work right away after the conference and training. For me, I knew I wanted to blog about having cancer and how it impacted my life. I started my blog, mylittlepinkmonkey.wordpress.com, as a way to communicate with people about the impact of MBC on me and my family. I also was interviewed on the iHeartRadio show with Melanie Young – Fearless Fabulous You to discuss the impact of an MBC diagnosis and did a local television interview as well for our ABC affiliate, KMGH-TV Channel 7 in Denver, Colorado. The interview I did for Channel 7 can be seen here . I participated in each interview with the hope of explaining MBC and focusing on the need for more research funding for stage IV breast cancer. Friends held a fundraiser among friends and family and we were able to raise approximately $15,000 for METAvivor to use toward MBC research grants – all 100% of the funds. I wrote to my state senators and representatives asking them to support better funding and the National Institutes of Health bill to inject much-needed monies toward researching disease. The 2015 HMV group continued to meet via telephone conferences throughout the year, and it was amazing to hear what the different members were doing. Starting yoga programs, contacting various breast cancer organizations to discuss MBC and request better focus on MBC patients, coordinating another die-in in Washington, D.C. on October 13th (MBC Awareness Day), sitting on Department of Defense committees about research funding, and so much more. My takeaway after being an HMV volunteer – there is no reason to let an MBC diagnosis steal your sense of empowerment. If you are looking for a way to take back some control and contribute toward making MBC a chronic condition and one that will hopefully be cured in the future, sign up to be an HMV volunteer. Your participation will only continue to help bring awareness to MBC and if we all work together to have a voice, that voice will be heard by the larger breast cancer community. We deserve to be heard – but we have to take the laboring oar ourselves. This is our lives at stake, and being an HMV volunteer is one way to stand up and let the world know how important your life is.

Today she shares how her surgery lead to life and career changing ideas and how it has directed her path for the future. The positive to my diagnosis, if ever there could be one, was that I was HER2+. This made me a candidate for Herceptin. Before 2006, Herceptin was only used in late-stage cancers, but by the time of my diagnosis, it was approved to treat HER2+, and it had a very favorable success rate in battling the disease. I kept thinking about the women before me with the same diagnosis prior to 2006. There were many who died waiting for the approval. There were many who died because they weren’t the right candidate. And now, there were many like me benefiting from the research and dollars drummed up by pink ribbons, walks and the memories of those women who were lost. I was grateful beyond words. Who is to say one way or another, but I believe the access to Herceptin saved my life. There is a wave of fear, anxiety and doubt that follows the flood of joy when your cancer doctor releases you from care with clear scans and positive words. It is almost even more overwhelming than the fear that greets us survivors upon diagnosis. Because now life is forever altered. Now there is nothing but a new set of what-ifs with no real solutions to challenge them. Now I had to go back to life without cancer, but a life very different than the one BEFORE cancer. People like to call it the “new normal.” And I woke every day to a different battle ahead of me; one that was about restoring myself to some semblance of the Dana I was before the disease.

How can you not notice – pink ribbons, pink building tops, pink fountains, pink toilet paper, pink professional sports teams…it’s a virtual sea of pink. As an eight-year breast cancer survivor, it is particularly striking. Most frustrating is to see items marketed during October with pink ribbons and to read the packaging and see that no money goes towards breast cancer research or support. This is simply a marketing tool that companies use to sell their products. This is an exploitation of all of the people who have experienced breast cancer. I urge consumers to read the packaging and see where your money is going, don’t fall into the pink washing trap. I have been actively involved with Living Beyond Breast Cancer since my diagnosis at age 31, while pregnant with my son, Hunter. After I was diagnosed they helped me to navigate my options for reconstruction. I became a helpline volunteer for them a few years ago and I volunteer whenever I am able. I am currently off of the Helpline while I enjoy my children – 11, 8 and 1. I am thankful for my life after breast cancer and for all of the support I received from LBBC. A long time supporter of LBBC is White House | Black Market. They, along with their sister companies, have donated over two million dollars to LBBC to fund its mission and programming! The dollars they say they will donate, they DO donate. They support women. That is a statement in itself. It is refreshing to run into a company that not only cares about their sales, but they care about the women who are their customers. They have done many beautiful ad campaigns celebrating women who have been affected by breast cancer. Each year they have products for sale and a large portion of the selling price is donated directly to LBBC. This year White House | Black Market has committed to donate up to $25,000 though their “Pink your Pic” campaign. It’s a simple way to show your support for breast cancer survivors while raising money for a great organization!

What a loaded statement given our circumstances. There were moments while I was planning our wedding that I was consumed with joy knowing that I had found my soul mate. I never thought I would love so deeply, trust so willingly and laugh so hard. There were also extremely difficult moments when I just about drove myself insane. What if the pain of my most current metastasis to my bones prevented me from walking gracefully down the aisle as I had dreamed? (I had acquired quite a limp at the start of the summer because of the disease in my hip.) And the one that kept me sleepless in bed a few nights after slaving over DIY projects and the perfect shade of pink…What if I get sick and we have to cancel the wedding? Trying to balance my diagnosis and my thoughts on forever didn’t just start with our wedding. I was diagnosed just one month after our engagement. While most women are basking in the glow of their recent engagement and diving head first into the sea of planning, I was forced to put all thoughts of a wedding on the back burner and focus on my health. It felt like all the things we planned to do might never come to be. The what-ifs that come with a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis can rival the worst day in treatment sometimes.

Thorlos became involved in the cause in 2007 after understanding it had the responsibility to take an active role. A group of employees joined a survivor in a three day fund raising walk that totaled nearly 60 miles. We learned so much that weekend. First, we were surrounded by a sense of caring and love that was incredibly strong yet impossible to put into words. We also quickly saw that our sock products – that are fabulous for foot and blister protection – were “sorely” needed (pun intended). The only question was how should we participate? In the first year we supported a single organization and quickly learned our consumers wanted us to also help other organizations that had helped them. Being a smaller brand we do listen closely to our consumers. Through their encouragement we decided to have them designate how our donations should be allocated. Our program donates $1 from each pair of pink padded Thorlos® sold to a worthy Breast Cancer Charity. Initially it was on two sock styles. We have now increased it to six styles including one for men which can be seen on our website. As you might guess LBBC was one of the organizations our consumers insisted their $1 be given to. They were right! We have learned that LBBC is a terrific organization of people and programs devoted to the newly diagnosed, young women, those living with metastatic breast cancer, African-Americans, those diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer and LGBT people affected by breast cancer. It complemented the other organizations our consumers wanted their donations to go to. So our active role is to help people participate year after year in fund raising walks and runs by protecting and taking care of their feet with our specially padded sock products. This year we asked the Institute for Preventive Foot Health – another nonprofit organization we support – to develop and fill three information voids important to fund raisers and those in the midst of fighting the disease. With LBBC we encourage you to review each of the following articles: Cause Walking: How to Protect Your Feet Before, During and After the Event Benefits of Regular Exercise for Women with Breast Cancer How Chemotherapy Can Affect the Feet Please contact us if we can help you or a loved one with their foot health needs.

92,23,28,[Timestamp('2015-10-05 00:00:00')],"October 13 is Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. The Cult of Perfect Motherhood blogger and Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer Beth Caldwell writes about an event taking place in Washington D.C. Beth invites you to learn more and join next Tuesday. For a lot of women with metastatic breast cancer, October is hard. You might be surprised by that – with all that pink, you might think it’d be a time where we feel supported and hopeful that the focus on breast cancer might bring us a cure soon. But for me and many others, all that pink inspires only frustration and anger and despair, and this year, we’re planning to turn those feelings into action. What many people don’t know about metastatic breast cancer is that there is no cure for it. Everyone who has it will die of or with their disease. Three out of 4 women and men (yes, men get breast cancer, too) diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer will be dead within 5 years, and the average life span from diagnosis is only about 3 years. Those of us diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer endure treatments that can rob us of our energy, our hair, our breasts, our fertility, and cause pain, vomiting, blisters on hands and feet, mouth sores, neuropathy, and a host of other horrible things. In sum, life with metastatic breast cancer is often nasty, brutish and short. In addition, many people don’t know how little of the research dollars for breast cancer go towards metastatic disease – the kind of breast cancer that kills you. It’s only about 7 percent. That’s right: 93 percent of the research dollars spent on breast cancer go towards early-stage breast cancer–the kind that doesn’t kill you. Which is why we still don’t know how or why some breast cancer metastasizes, or how to stop it from metastasizing, or how to stop metastatic breast cancer from killing people. We’re spending 93% of our precious research dollars asking the wrong questions. On top of that, those of us with metastatic breast cancer know that awareness is not a cure. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to tell my then-6-year-old son, I started out by asking if he knew what breast cancer is, and he said yes. Even HE was aware of breast cancer. If awareness was the solution, 40,000 Americans wouldn’t be dying every year from metastatic breast cancer. Including me. So, now that you know all this about metastatic breast cancer, imagine how we feel when we turn on the television or go to a store and see a sea of pink, knowing that the awareness won’t save us and that the vast majority of the money being raised isn’t helping us either. We see that pink ribbon and know that for those of us with metastatic disease, the pink ribbon will someday turn to black. Knowing all this, our anger and frustration and despair doesn’t seem so odd, does it? But this year, we’re trying to do something about it. We’ve started an organization called MET UP, modeled on ACT UP – the AIDS activist group that helped change the landscape for people living with AIDS. We intend to demand change in the world of breast cancer, and we’re starting by organizing a protest at the U.S. Capitol on October 13. We’ll gather at 11 a.m., and at noon we’ll hold hands and lay down to honor the 110 Americans and 1,430 people worldwide who die every day of metastatic breast cancer. We will also be meeting with aides to members of Congress to demand that Congress direct the National Cancer Institute to begin collecting data on how many people with early-stage breast cancer later develop metastatic disease; fund more cancer research in general;, and ensure more federal research dollars are spent on metastatic disease, so that, like people with AIDS, people with metastatic breast cancer can live with their disease instead of dying from it. We’d encourage anyone who wants to help save our lives to join us at the Capitol on October 13, to show the world what metastatic breast cancer really looks like. I truly believe that if we join together and make our voices heard, we can change the landscape for people living with metastatic breast cancer, and I hope you’ll join us in this effort!

99,23,34,[Timestamp('2015-09-21 00:00:00')],"Reprinted with permission by the author, Maura Bivens. Read more of Maura’s blog posts at The Pink Stink. Directly below is a video she created for the Beyond The Breast Campaign. I had a blog years ago, long before everyone and their tumor had a blog. I guess you could say I was a hipster long before being a hipster was even a thing; as soon as something was too trendy it was time for me to move on. This applied to everything from haircuts to cities. I started my adult life living in Orlando in 1991, right as Nickelodeon opened its studio and all sorts of movies and TV shows were filmed there. Next I moved to Seattle right as the grunge movement hit, the city inundated with young adults wearing plaid and rejecting any form of cleanliness. I was not into that movement. Two years later, now married, we moved to my homeland, Boston. I never thought Boston would be so “in”, thanks to Ally McBeal and other legal shows making it look so cool to be young and hip in Boston. In mid 2000’s we moved with our 2 kids to Las Vegas. But in 2004, who didn’t, for goodness sake? An estimated 5,000 people moved in every month. I really didn’t see that one coming. But I stayed in Vegas, wearing my yoga pants until I ditched those when it became the housewife’s uniform in the Summerlin area. In 2008 I found out I had breast cancer and my whole world went pink. Yes, I knew pink was one of the most recognizable ribbons, and still I felt that at stage IIB it was my duty to help spread awareness. Every October I would color my hair pink so that when people asked about it, I could tell them a little bit about the less common type of breast cancer I have, Triple Negative. A few Octobers later strangers stopped noticing, for pink hair was the trend and way too many people in Las Vegas wore it on a regular basis. October was becoming a big explosion of pink! There were now pink blenders, pink deodorant, and pink feminine products. (OK, I guess they always had those) In 2010 I got the news that my cancer was back, and it had metastasized to my lungs and statistics showed I have about a year left to live. Suddenly, multiple songs hit the radio waves about living like your dying. Really?? How can this be a thing!? The big hit that year was the song “If I Die Young”. At the time I was 41 and could only be in Young Survival Coalition because of my age at diagnosis, but I considered myself to be young. My kids sure were- ages 9, 6, and 3. Let me tell you, these songs and videos about “living like you were dying” didn’t have a clue- it is exhausting. Living life frantically and trying to grab hold to remember every minute isn’t something that can be done for long. After completing many rounds of brutal chemo, it looked like the cancer had stabilized so I asked what we are doing here. Am I living, am I dying, what is this? My oncologist explained it as we are trying to get me as strong as possible for the next round of treatment. Spoiler alert-I haven’t died yet. In fact, it has been almost 5 years since any evidence of disease. I just found out there is a name for me; Exceptional Responder. I’m thinking that’s the medical term for miracle. But I had those words stuck in my head, and this is how I live. I am trying to get myself as strong as possible for the next round of treatment. Even this August when I hit five years NED, I still want to be eating well and trying to be in the best shape I can be because I will always be stage IV. This is my story of living in between worlds. https://videopress.com/videopress-iframe.js",1,1,0.08693221030177554

She writes when she tells her story in this post for the Beyond The Breast Campaign In December 2005, I attended my first educational conference about breast cancer. The topic was about fertility in young women while going through a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat there and just listened to all that was going on around me. I had just had chemotherapy treatment that week and wasn’t feeling 100%. There was a guest speaker who told her story. Her journey through breast cancer was incredible. Through all the surgeries and treatments she endured displayed an insurmountable amount of strength. I remember sitting there thinking, “I don’t have a story like that, WOW!” I had just started my journey and was in a fog as to what living beyond breast cancer should look like because I was a “newbie” in the fight. As I continued on my path, growing through each step of the process, I began to think maybe I do have a story. There are so many things that go on that are ‘not so pretty in pink’, that no one prepared me for. At each conference I attended, trying to figure out my new normal, I learned something new to add to my zest for life. Somewhere in this process I began to blog from time to time and shared my story almost to anybody who would listen. I didn’t want anyone to have to experience the depression, fear, anger, loss friendships due to their inability to cope, and loneliness. These are the things that all cancer patients go through behind closed doors. Eventually I was able to retire from my job and define my purpose and eagerness to help others by becoming a breast cancer advocate. I learned how to tell my story to encourage, educate and empower others to fight through a breast cancer diagnosis. SO, I was asked, why do I tell my story? Honestly, I had to think: Why do I tell my story? There are several reasons. I choose to share my story so that others don’t feel they are alone. I tell my story because I am an African-American and my community needs to be able to relate to the messenger. I tell my story because I was stage I at my initial diagnosis and now LIVING with stage IV. I tell my story because I will celebrate 10 years of survival this month and I know this gives other women hope. I tell my story because I’ve learned that little money is spent on research for metastatic breast cancer and I’m running out of time to have my voice heard. This is why I am so grateful to be a Hear My Voice Outreach Volunteer with LBBC: to participate in community events and advocacy for metastatic disease. I tell my story for those that are no longer able to tell theirs. Lastly, I tell my story for my children. They will always be able to access who their mom is as a person who truly cares, as a survivor, as a fighter, as a friend, as an advocate and someone who has used her own journey to try to save lives. In closing, I realize I do have a story. Each and every on of us does. Sharing is caring!",1,1,0.19200757575757574
102,23,37,[Timestamp('2015-09-21 00:00:00')],"Ishiuan Hargrove, on triple-negative metastatic breast cancer. Join our Beyond the Breast Social Media Takeover. Today is Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s social media campaign #beyondthebreast; as someone who has been living with breast cancer for 9 years, I would like to share some of my insights on how I live with my triple-negative metastatic breast cancer. So there are two major components of this blog: a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) portion and a metastatic (MBC) portion. When a pathology report shows someone with a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), that’s any breast cancer that does not express the genes for estrogen-receptor (ER), progesterone-receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu). TNBC accounts for approximately 10 to 20 percent of all breast cancer cases and because the absence of ER, PR and HER2 receptors for targeted therapy, treatment options for TNBC patients are unfortunately very limited. TNBC is the subtype with the highest levels of recurrence and lowest survival rates compared to all other breast cancer subtypes. Here are some facts: According to the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2015, about 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed among women in the United States. About 40,290 women will die from the disease this year. A group of these women who have been treated for breast cancer are living under the shadow of possibility of cancer recurrence and metastasis. Metastasis is when the breast cancer cells no longer stay inside the breast and spreads to the rest of the body. The typical sites where the breast cancer may spread include bones, liver, lungs and brain. One major fact included in Metastatic Breast Cancer Network’s (MBCN) “13 Facts Everyone Should Know About Metastatic Breast Cancer is, “No one dies from breast cancer that remains in the breast. Metastasis occurs when cancerous cells travel to a vital organ and that is what threatens life.” So not only I was inducted to the BC club, I was diagnosed with TNBC, which still has no targeted therapy. A few years after my initial diagnosis, my cancer spread to my lung and my brain. I have two boys and I was initially diagnosed when I was nursing my second son. He is now nine years old and it took me awhile to explain to both of them that I DO NOT have lung cancer and I DO NOT have brain cancer. These sites of metastases are both part of my breast cancer. After explaining my diagnosis to my children, I realized I have to do a similar kind of explanation to adults as well. The statistics look pretty bleak in my situation. Funny thing is, I am a board certified medical physicist specialized in radiation oncology. I spent 15 years of my life treating patients with cancer by radiation, including myself! Sometimes I wonder about my purpose in life. Now I thought perhaps I could show others that metastatic cancer is not an automatic death sentence. Yes, most of us ultimately die from this disease, but some could live for many years and perhaps even preserve a quality of life. As much as the statistics offered from national cancer registries, there are no definitive prognostic statistics for MBC. We should all look at ourselves as unique cases. Through out my years of fighting cancer, I found myself gradually moving away from the most aggressive treatment options aiming for a cure, and drawn toward the palliative treatment that focuses on control of the disease and preserving quality of life. If a drug is making me feel worse than the disease itself, I might voluntary quit. If I can preserve my own immune system to a degree, I can co-exist with my cancer cells and “wait it out” until the next new drug becomes available. I now volunteer through LBBC’s Hearing My Voice Outreach Volunteer Program, doing patient advocacy and trying to share my experience with others who are walking on the same path. Living with a terminal illness can be a lonely road and sometimes even the closest person to you does not offer comfort. I keep friends who lift me up and cut loose the ones who bring me down. I stopped rushing. I started to say “no” sometimes. I’m concerned with being interested than being interesting. And finally, I ride my bicycle as much as I physically can. Cancer has taken a lot of things away from me already. I refuse to let it to take more. Sometimes waiting for the doctors and new drugs is not as useful as taking the action into my own hand. One way I do this is by trying to attend as many educational conferences about metastatic cancer is a great way to get hope. You get support and updates, and realize there are so many talented and intelligent people out there willing to help us and are trying to find a cure for our diseases. I also act as a patient’s advocate. We need to gather our resources to help fight this dreadful disease. Our society is taking collateral damage when breast cancer is hurting someone’s wife, mother, sister or daughter. When this October comes, please do not just link the breast cancer with pink. As a matter of fact, please do your own research to decide who and what to support when you give your donation to fight breast cancer.",1,1,0.12450765724575247

She dedicates the piece to her 2012-2013 Civil Procedure class at the University of Massachusetts School of Law (pictured below). I dyed it pink as day seventeen approached. I wondered if the falling out would be slow, snaking its way strand by strand down my shoulders, past my hips to the floor. Or sudden, clumps of dark blonde hair appearing in my hands during a shower, or when I casually reached up to idly twist some strands during a conversation. I couldn’t cut it short, even though so many said this would make it easier. But I had lost a breast already; this would be another piece of my femininity gone. And so with my four-year old daughter by my side I cut two pieces of the long hair I’d always had, tied them with ribbons – one for her, one for me. Then, with a friend’s help and some hair dye, we became pink. Amy Reichbach (pictured in the middle). And somehow, a few days later, after I stood in front of my class of first-year law students explaining that I would be starting chemo and losing my hair sometime after their final exam, and that I’d gone pink with my daughter to help ease her anxiety about my impending baldness, they all showed up pink too. These special people who had kept me working, who had motivated me to return as soon as possible after each surgery – their beards and hair and clothes were all pink. My attendance sheet went around that day and came back covered in pink stickers. Pink cookies had been baked and stacked on a plate at the front of the classroom. I cried. And then I taught. And they learned another sort of lesson – that it was okay to be vulnerable, that connection mattered, that every day we would come back to the same room and do what we did.

Proposed for women at average risk for breast cancer, they differ in certain details from the guidelines released in 2009 by the USPSTF. These differences have caused no end of heated discussion. Furthermore, the USPSTF is in the process of updating their 2009 guidelines. A draft of their revised guidelines was open to public comment through May of this year, and is now being finalized. A member of the USPSTF explained the rationale for this update in the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the ACS is planning to publish separate screening guidelines for high and intermediate risk women in 2016. Is it any wonder that women are more confused than ever about how and when to get screened for breast cancer? Enter Madame Astra Zen-Acre. Recently, she and several other fortune tellers, psychics, witches, and assorted healers formed an organization dedicated to resolving this confusion once and for all. Their organization, called Infallible Diagnostic Knowingness, or IDK, was founded to make their services available at no charge to anyone who wants to avail themselves of a reliable, radiation-free screening method that can predict breast cancer years before anything shows up on a standard screening tool. “Guidelines, schmidelines,” said Madame Astra in a recent interview. “We members of IDK can pick up cancerous emanations long before those foolish, low-tech machines. And we’ve been doing this for centuries.” As for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, or BCAM, Astra Zen-Acre is dismissive. “Awareness, my left foot,” she said. “We live and breathe true awareness, not some jumped-up marketing opportunity. Plus, they stole our acronym. We’ve had an initiative called BCAM for decades now. It stands for Be Cautious About Mammograms. As soon as they started pushing those damned, primitive machines in 1969, we knew they were trouble.” Regarding the color pink, Madame Astra declared, “The only thing pink should be associated with is the heart chakra, which stands for love and healing. A pink mixer isn’t going to cure a blasted thing. We don’t even use them for our potions. Nothing beats a good, old-fashioned cauldron.” When asked how women who are interested in a screening session could contact a member of IDK, Madame Astra laughed. “Oh, Honey,” she said, “we’ll contact you!” Posted in: Attitude, Diagnosis, Recurrence, Screening, Fighting the Pink Peril by Kathi 4 Comments BCAM, breast cancer awareness, Halloween, mammography, mammography guidelines, Pinktober",1,1,0.0960185528756957
172,26,12,[Timestamp('2015-09-23 00:00:00')],"Published at: 01:09 pm - September 23, 2015 In fact, this sticker is inaccurate. I got my 3D tomosynthesis-assisted mammogram a week ago. As I am wont to do, I wore my employee ID badge, identifying me as a clinician, to the appointment. Perhaps for that reason, or perhaps because of my breast cancer history, or perhaps because the mammographer called in one of her colleagues to check that she got all the images she needed to, I got to watch the computer monitor as they scrolled through the digital images that had just been taken of my breast-and-a-half. None of us saw anything alarming, but what do we know? Well, as it happens, we know a lot, but the radiologist has the last word. I was pleased that the misshapen lump that is what’s left of my right breast was utterly without density. And the left breast appeared to have only “scattered areas of fibroglandular density.”[1] This is a change from a few previous mammograms, which had shown that my breast-and-a-half was getting denser. Okay, I’m not a radiologist, but I was glad to see that my breast tissue seems to be trending toward less density, after trending toward more. Who knows why, but I do take vitamin D3, which has been associated with decreasing breast cancer risk, possibly by a mechanism which reverses breast tissue density.[2] So perhaps after taking a lot of it these past few years, it’s doing something. Anyway, bottom line is the thing was negative, according to the damned report I finally got a week later, after hectoring my poor primary care doc, then driving to my local hospital and getting a copy of it, plus a disk with the images, from the nice diagnostic imaging clerk. The nice clerk, after reading my ID badge, which identified me as a clinician, and looking at the computer, which identified me as a person with a breast cancer history, initiated an interesting conversation. I will paraphrase it as follows: She: You know, these 3D things are pretty good, but why don’t we have a better method for detecting breast cancer than mammograms? Me: I know! Mammography is so last century. She: And what about all that radiation? I mean, this woman comes in who’s 70, who’s had all these mammograms, and the current mammogram is negative, and she says, “But I can feel a lump,” and then she gets an ultrasound that finds out she has breast cancer. Come on! After all those mammograms that didn’t find anything? What’s up with that? And you have to wonder if all that radiation caused the damn breast cancer after all those years. (The jury is still out on this subject, by the way, but here’s a quote from the National Cancer Institute[3]: “Radiation-induced mutations can cause breast cancer, especially if exposure occurs before age 30 years and is at high doses, such as from mantle radiation therapy for Hodgkin’s disease. The breast dose associated with a typical two-view mammogram is approximately 4 mSv and extremely unlikely to cause cancer. One Sv is equivalent to 200 mammograms. Latency is at least 8 years, and the increased risk is lifelong.” But to continue…) Me: No kidding, huh? Way too many lesions are missed by mammograms, no matter how fancy they are. She: I think everyone should at least get a breast MRI, say, every five years, no matter what. But then, that would be MORE radiation. It’s nuts. Me: I know, I know! There are some blood tests being developed, but who knows how long it will be before they are reliable and available. She: It’s crazy. And that 70-year-old woman? They were ready to send her home after that last mammogram, and she had to insist that she get some follow-up. I had to call the ultrasound person and get them to see her right then. And they said that the cancer had probably been developing for years. Years! Me: And then we have Pinktober, which is all about corporations selling pink crap and making money, and here we are in 2015, still stuck with outdated detection technology. Not to mention that up to 30% of women who’ve had breast cancer will develop metastatic, stage IV breast cancer. Is 30% of the research on breast cancer going to stage IV? No! And men don’t even know to get screened, and by the time they do, well… She: I know! We had a man come in, whose sister had breast cancer, and it never occurred to him that he might be at risk, too. And then he found a lump…I told him, if your sister has breast cancer, and you’re her brother, then, you’ve got to get checked. Me: Yeah, not to mention BRCA genetic mutations. They’re carried by men and women. She: And why don’t doctors who have patients who smoke cigarettes make sure they get a regular chest X-ray? We have all these women getting mammograms, that don’t work sometimes, and here’s these people who are at risk for lung cancer, and they never get a chest X-ray! Totally crazy. Me: Yes, it is. She: Well, here’s your report and your disk. Do you need anything else? Me: No, I’m all set. Thanks very much. She: You’re welcome. Nice talking with someone who has a clue, you know? I don’t get to have this kind of conversation very often. References: 1. ACR BI-RADS® ATLAS — MAMMOGRAPHY. Report with images on interpreting breast density. 2.

173,26,13,[Timestamp('2015-09-07 00:00:00')],"Published at: 02:09 pm - September 07, 2015 It’s only September, and already I’m sick of Pinktober. Already, there’s been ‘sexy’ pink fundraising idiocy, stupid Facebook ‘awareness’ games, and nine pages of newly execrable pink wearables and ceramic tchotchkes on the Bradford Exchange site. Who buys this crap? There was a #PinkOFF hashtag circulating on Twitter in the past few years. I say, let’s revive it. Because I’m already pinked off. In an attempt to introduce a note of reality into the whole awareness thing, I’m going to describe some real-life folks with breast cancer. We are not the “A list” people. You know, the people who take up skydiving after treatment, and go on book tours to advertise the inspirational tomes they’ve written about how skydiving gave them back their lives after breast cancer. Frankly, the rest of us are way too exhausted for any of that, nor can we afford the skydiving lessons or the cross-continental plane fares. We don’t feel like warriors or heroes, and we’re ‘survivors’ only in the sense that, so far, we’re still breathing. We don’t walk around decked out in pink ribbon jewelry or pink sweat suits so that we’re easily identifiable. Some of us blog, when we have the energy. But, in the land of happy, pretty-in-pink breast cancer awareness, we’re not represented. We’re the silent majority, as it were. We’re on the “other” list. And trust me — it’s a much longer list. What we represent is the reality of breast cancer. So, without further ado, here’s a short list of some of us: Seven years after diagnosis and treatment, I’m still tired. Still broke because I haven’t been able to work full-time since. Still have fibrotic scar tissue from surgery and radiation. Still have pain, muscle spasms, restricted motion. Still foggy. Still constantly juggling to pay the bills. But I consider myself fortunate. At least I can work. And so far, I’m still NED — pending my next mammogram in a few weeks. There’s a young woman I’ve known for several years now who, after discovering she was BRCA positive, had a preventative bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. Swear to god, she developed every post-op complication known to womankind — flap failure, tissue necrosis, blood clots, adhesive capsulitis, infections, you name it. The end results, after several hospitalizations and surgeries, are still uneven and imperfect. She’s still tired. She’s still on a blood thinner. She’s still in pain. But she’s a mom and a wife, and her family are just glad she’s still alive. Then there’s the woman who is an artist, who developed severe peripheral neuropathy in her hands after chemotherapy. Actually, I know a number of folks who fit this description. One of them had to give up making art entirely. One of them, after years of unrelieved pain despite trying an array of meds, finally found something that helps, and manages to work as an artist, although it’s still a struggle. One of them had to stop drawing, because it hurt too much, and took up photography, which hurt less, although she’s too tired to do enough work to make a living, so she scrapes by on disability. Speaking of giving up doing the things you love, there’s my friend who recently had to give up a long, successful, much-loved professional career because of the pain, exhaustion, and complications caused by stage IV breast cancer. It’s hard to have a life when you seem to spend half of it in the hospital and the other half recovering from being in the hospital. Then there’s another artist friend who has stage IV breast cancer. Before she had breast cancer, she was an accomplished, imaginative photographer, had gallery shows, the whole nine yards. Not now. Now, when she’s not having more surgery or radiation or chemotherapy, she still occasionally manages to take some fabulous photos, if she has the time or energy after helping to look after an aging parent, as well as her very young grandchildren. Then there’s the woman who was treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma in her early twenties. Years after treatment, she developed life-threatening coronary artery blockage due to the extensive radiation she received. She survived two stent placements by angioplasty, only to end up later being diagnosed with breast cancer. Oy. You don’t get a treatment discount for developing a second kind of cancer. Then there’s my friend with stage IV breast cancer who was recently diagnosed with a different, and rare, kind of cancer. If her kidneys are cooperating, she may be getting her first chemo infusion for that second cancer as I type this. Fingers crossed. I could go on. There’s my friend with metastatic breast cancer whose husband has recurring melanoma. There’s my friend who finished treatment for breast cancer, whose mother was then diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. There’s my friend whose husband was such a shit while she was being treated for breast cancer, she had to get a divorce. There’s my friend who had breast cancer who later developed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. None of us are likely to appear on the Today Show or be asked to tell our stories at a Komen fundraiser. But if anyone would like to raise some genuine breast cancer awareness next month, maybe we should. I’m not holding my breath though. And I won’t be wearing pink.

175,26,15,[Timestamp('2015-07-12 00:00:00')],"Published at: 01:07 pm - July 12, 2015 Seven Years Later… It’s nearly seven years to the day that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I’m still here, still NED, as far as I know, so in that regard, seven is a lucky number. However, I’d rather hoped that by now, I would feel a lot more like my old self again. I think I’ve accepted the fact that I will never feel exactly like my old self again. I just thought I’d feel better than this. I do feel better. I think. That’s the problem, though. I’m not sure I can tell anymore. My ability to think has changed so much, I’m not sure I can trust my self-analysis. I’ve gotten so used to adjusting (lowering) my expectations for my mental and physical stamina, pretty much on an hourly basis, that I can’t tell for sure if my stamina is really any better than it was, say, two years ago, or if my expectations have declined so much that I don’t remember what normal stamina feels like anymore. In some ways, I wonder if I’ve gotten worse. I decided to write this post because it bothers me that I haven’t been able to write as many posts as I’d like. It’s not for lack of subject matter. I have about a dozen topics on my prospective-post list, many of them partially researched. But getting myself geared up to sit down and write them? That seems to be harder than it used to be. The big question is why. I think I know the answer. In an article by Dr. Frances Goodhart, clinical psychologist and author of The Cancer Survivor’s Companion, she suggests that the way to deal with decreased mental and physical stamina is to employ “the “3 Ps” – prioritise, plan and pace yourself.” Believe me, I could write my own book on this subject, if I weren’t still such a train wreck. I’ve been prioritising, planning and pacing myself on an almost constant basis for the past seven years. But my priorities have had to change in the last few years. A lot. There are four factors that have made my life with cancer’s aftermath more challenging all along, but much moreso recently. In the first place, I’m single. Therefore, I have only one income on which to live — mine. Which leads to the second factor, my demanding, draining, satisfying yet often frustrating job as a homecare physical therapist. I do not have a partner, spouse, butler, personal assistant, trust fund, living parents or anyone else who is contributing to paying the bills or maintaining my existence on a regular basis. And but for a brief, insane few months right after I returned to work when acute treatment was done, I haven’t been able to work full time for over six years now. So, that’s factor number three — living on one fifth less income than I used to. The last factor is that I own a house. It’s a small house, with a small yard, but it still requires upkeep. We won’t even mention the car. For a long time, I didn’t really have the wherewithal to deal with factor number four in any consistent way. Just crawling to work each day, helping solve other people’s health problems, and then crawling home was about all I could manage. For most of the past six years, I had to take neurostimulants to get through each work day, otherwise I was exhausted by mid-morning. When I got home, I could just about feed the pets and myself, make sure I had something clean to wear to work the next day, and crawl into bed. I’d sleep for ten to twelve hours, then do it all over again the next day. If I hadn’t set up automatic bill payment online, most of my bills would probably not have gotten paid on time. If I weren’t a physical therapist, and therefore spent my work days exercising and walking with my patients, and schlepping through parking lots with my heavy work bag, and climbing stairs in apartment buildings, I probably wouldn’t have gotten much exercise either. On my days off, sometimes I was able to channel my frustration, my need for answers, my outrage at pinksploitation, and my sense of the absurd viscissitudes of breast cancer into blog posts. I felt a lot of frustration and outrage. I wrote a lot of snarky blog posts. Meanwhile, my sweet, innocent, neglected little house looked more and more like a trash pit. And then I got frustrated with the mess. And my job got harder, because working in healthcare has gotten harder. Ergo, I had to shift my priorities. Ergo, more of my limited energy got spent on shoveling out the trash pit, and on trying to sharpen my ailing mental abilities for my job and my patients. And consequently, I had a lot less energy left over to channel my ongoing outrage about breast cancer and turn it into blog posts. Snark needs pep, and my pep was pooped. Some of my blog pals have been writing posts this past week describing ’15 Random Things About Myself.’ I’ve enjoyed reading them. Trouble is, it takes most of my effort these days to remember fifteen non-random things about myself. I remember my name and address. I still have to think about my phone number sometimes, because it’s not one of those nifty numeric patterns that makes it easy to recall. I remember how to drive, and with a little planning, how to get to my patients’ homes. Mostly, I remember how to do my job. I’m still learning how to deal with being a homeowner. Last winter’s ungodly record-breaking snowfall here taught me things I never knew about homeownership, the consequences of which I am still tackling. I am constantly worried about money and the personal inadequacy thereof. I also make a concerted effort to remember my friends and all the bat excrement they are dealing with. That’s about all I can handle. Since the beginning of this year, pursuant to shoveling out the trash pit that is my house, I estimated that I must have shredded or otherwise disposed of about 400 or so cubic feet of old paper records and junk mail. A lot of this was shoved into bags or boxes that occupied every room in my house except the bathroom. It was thus arranged because I haven’t been able to cope with it until this year. Most of it was in the room I use as my art studio. However, I had to get it out of the way because I have to have my home insulation upgraded. And in order for the crew to do this, they have to be able to walk from room to room. With ladders and tools and rolls of insulation. And they have to be able to get into the attic. And I have two attics, one over the main house, and one over the converted garage that is my art studio. Oh, and they also have to get at the foundation sills in the basement. So, this entire project was no mean feat. And that was only one part of it, because it also meant that I had to clean out my drawers and closets to get rid of the clothes that I don’t wear anymore, that were hanging on door hooks or folded up or bagged in various parts of the house, because they didn’t fit into my limited closet space. I’ve made a lot of progress. I’m also not done, but I’m about done enough to arrange for the crew to start. I cannot even begin to describe how much mental and physical exertion this has entailed. I find I can last for about 45 minutes before I have to stop and lie down again. Sometimes, I can manage about three or four of these sessions in a day. Sometimes, I can’t manage any at all. My hope is that, by the beginning of this winter, I will have a much tidier and better-insulated house, with a lot less stuff in it. Then, maybe I can spend less time dealing with it and more time writing and drawing and channelling snark into this blog. I’ll let you know how it goes. Life is complicated. I need a nap.

183,26,22,[Timestamp('2015-01-01 00:00:00')],"Published at: 02:01 pm - January 01, 2015 Six years ago today, I started this blog. So, first of all, thank you, dear readers and friends, for visiting, emailing, commenting, sharing, and generally making this labor of love worthwhile. You have definitely put the ‘social’ in social media. I’m glad I’m still here. Things I Did in 2014 1. According to all my requisite tests, I remained free of cancer. Or, at least, whatever cancer can be detected by means of these tests. You never know. You do what you can. 2. I took what might be considered an embarrassing number of mostly cellphone pix of my cat Fiona. And why not? She’s eminently photogenic. There are, however, several other reasons for this. Not the least of them is that she’s my one remaining fur baby. Since I started this blog, which was shortly after finishing acute cancer treatment, I’ve lost four of the five fur babies I’ve had the pleasure of living with in the past six years. Three of the ones I’ve lost were cats, including the inimitable Chloe, a glamorous peach-point Himalayan; a silly, lovely black Persian male named Jett; and the incomparable Teddy, a gray and white Manx who was more popular among my Facebook friends than I was. The other fur baby I lost was my dog, Foxy. I miss them all. One of the things I noted from the start about being diagnosed with cancer is that, while it frightened me witless, wore me out, drained my bank account, and pissed me off, it didn’t break my heart. Losing my fur babies? That broke my heart. And this past summer, for a few awful weeks, I was afraid I was going to lose Fiona, too. She developed hyperthyroidism, a not unusual health problem for older cats. But it snuck up on us so stealthily that, by the time her symptoms become obvious, she quickly developed other symptoms that are sometimes called a thyroid storm. Not only had she lost a significant amount of weight, but due to the stress on her system, she also exhibited cardiac and respiratory distress, and neurologic symptoms that manifested as seizures. She’s fine now, back to her normal fluffy self, everything behaving as it should, and taking her methimazole twice a day in her nutritious wet food. I may only have her for a few more years, but I want every minute of them that I can get. Hers is the face on my little web avatar, resting on my computer keyboard when I post comments on blogs, and I intend to keep her there as long as I can. So, in the meantime, she’ll just have to put up with my picture-taking. 3. I shredded about 38 cubic feet of paper, or the equivalent of about 20 good-sized cartons. It continues to mystify me, in this digital age, that I end up with so much paper, but there it is. Most of this accumulation was a direct result of being completely poleaxed by cancer treatment. Cancer-related fatigue is a subject about which I’ve posted many, many times, and has undoubtedly been for me the most life-altering aspect of cancer treatment. Needless to say, when about all I could manage for days and months and years on end, after dragging myself home from work, was to collapse into bed for a nap, scrape together some food for me and my pets, make sure I paid my bills, and keep the house from falling down, keeping up with the disposal of extraneous paper was very far down on my to-do list. So, it would get piled up, then stuffed into boxes or brown paper grocery bags, which would then get stuffed into whatever corner I could find, and summarily ignored. Until this year. There are still a few more cubic feet to go. But I’m on it now, and I have a lot more floor space. More room to dance. 4. I turned sixty. So did several friends, and a lot of other people, like Rene Russo and Denzel Washington, as well as writer Anne Lamott, with whom I share my date of birth. So far, it’s been pretty good being sixty. I may be slower, but I’m also a lot wilier. 5. I divested myself of a lot of stuff. Clothes, mismatched socks, tchotchkes, broken patio furniture, dead batteries, electronica. I recycled where I could, and the Big Sisters got a lot of donations. Maybe it’s something to do with getting older, but I’ve gotten to that point where I just feel like I have too much stuff. I’ve even made a pact with some of my friends about it. We now try to gift each other with experiences rather than things whenever possible. 6. I planted new plants in my garden. My long-term goal is to replace as much grass as possible with plants. Lawns are so overrated. It’s also nice just to have a long-term goal. For a few years there, I was afraid to make any goals at all. Perspective, baby. Buzz off, cancer. 7. I created a few memorable internet memes. The most successful of these was the Pinknado meme, which was created for a post that kicked off that hideous period of pink merchandizing excess known as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I don’t know what officially constitutes having a meme go ‘viral,’ but I do know that my Pinknado poster was widely and satisfyingly shared over various social media. I can also report that it was printed, with my permission, to poster size and is hanging on the walls of a few like-minded souls. It was also featured in an article about cultural resistance to the Pink Peril by writer Gayle Sulik for the Breast Cancer Consortium. Among my favorites, it was even used, poster-sized, as part of a college sociology class, along with a showing of the documentary film, Pink Ribbons, Inc. This caused one of my friends to joke appreciatively, “Fantastic! ‘I received my Ph.D. in Pinknado.'” Perhaps the most promising news is that the folks who made Sharknado, whose movie poster inspired me, also released Sharknado 2 last year, with plans to release Sharknado 3 this summer. We could both keep this up for years to come. 8. I started writing a memoir. No, not about cancer. About my frequently crazy, sometimes magical, always challenging upbringing. It won’t be a linear thing, but a collection of stories and vignettes. I have a long list of them. I’ve shared a few here on the blog from time to time, so there will likely be more. Stay tuned. 9. I kept my sanity. Once you know the depth and breadth of #8, you’ll appreciate why this is an unparalleled achievement. Every day, in every way, I am thankful to be relatively sane. 10. I had the love and support of my friends. Without them, I’d surely be unable to accomplish #9. Real world and online, I was lucky enough to make new friends and deepen my relationship with old friends. I also lost a few dear friends in 2014, and I keep their memories in my heart. Surely the best thing I did this year was to be, I hope, a good friend to those I love. I don’t make resolutions, but I always resolve to be a good friend. So, I didn’t go bungee jumping or skydiving, but when one works as a physical therapist, such activities lose their appeal anyway. I didn’t write as many blog posts as I’d like, but the mental rest has done me good, and I have lots of notes for upcoming posts. It was a year when I had to avoid listening to the news quite a lot. But I helped a lot of my patients. And I read dozens, if not hundreds, of books. And I had fun. And I laughed. And I found something for which to be grateful every day. It was a pretty good year. On to the new one. Hope you’ll all continue to be part of it.

186,26,25,[Timestamp('2014-10-29 00:00:00')],"Published at: 09:10 pm - October 29, 2014 Recently, Komen demonstrated the lengths to which it will go to sign up new corporate partners. Miffed at the reaction to its recent partnership with oil-drilling and fracking corporation, Baker Hughes, the iconic Komen logo was seen last Sunday night in a Pittsburgh hotel lounge, showing some leg to a prospective new partner. Earlier that day, a rally, led by Breast Cancer Action, was held outside of a Pittsburgh Steelers game, where Komen accepted a $100,000 check from Baker Hughes during half-time. Prior to the rally, protesters had gathered over 150,000 signatures to demand that Komen break its ties with Baker Hughes. The fracking process involves dozens of chemicals known to be linked with cancer. Komen, defiant in the face of this public shaming, brought further shame on itself by deciding to tie one on in an unnamed hotel lounge later that evening. A hotel bartender, who asked not to be named, observed Komen ‘flaunting itself with some corporate type until the wee hours,’ but could not say what the ultimate outcome of this encounter was. ‘Let’s just say that I saw a room key passed across the table,’ the bartender reported. One rally participant, who was staying at the same hotel, remarked, ‘I’m certainly not surprised. We’ve all suspected for years now that Komen will do anything for money. And damn the consequences.’ ~ Posted in: Fighting the Pink Peril by Kathi 4 Comments breast cancer awareness month, cause marketing, corporate sharks, Komen, Pinktober, pinkwashing",1,1,0.014669421487603302
187,26,26,[Timestamp('2014-10-11 00:00:00')],"Published at: 11:10 am - October 11, 2014 Flying Monkeys I got an email last evening from a woman who said she was from one of the more venerable online news sources, one that used to be in print. She said she was a senior editor who was “working on a piece about what you shouldn’t say to a breast cancer patient, and I was hoping you could lend your insight. If you’re open to it, could you send me your thoughts on what people shouldn’t say (and why), and some examples of what they could say that would be much better? Any anecdotes or advice would be terrific, and I would love to include your thoughts.” It immediately occurred to me that one of the things you shouldn’t say to a breast cancer patient was that you’d like her to tell you what you shouldn’t say to a breast cancer patient. I emailed her back, thanked her for asking me, but suggested to her that “this topic has been done to death. If you Google ‘what not to say to breast cancer patients,’ you’ll see what I mean.” I provided a link to a post by another blogger, who has metastatic breast cancer, who’s written what I think is pretty much the last word on the subject: Stupid things people say to those with cancer & their families. I then went on to say, “With respect, I think there are a lot more apt and important angles on breast cancer that you could write about, especially for a media outlet as esteemed as _____. For instance, how many of the 1300 breast cancer charitable organizations are actually involved in some kind of fraudulent fundraising practices?” I then referred her to my last blog post. The use of the word ‘esteemed’ might have been laying it on a little thick, but I was trying to be polite while thinking she was alarmingly unimaginative for a ‘senior editor.’ I closed with a bit of nicey-nice and sent it off. A short time later, she emailed back, saying, “I can assure you that the team has a very robust lineup of content planned — not just this piece.” I thought her tone was a little snippy, but I suppose mine was, too. She did close with “Thanks.” Naturally, I went to check out this news site. It’s a clean site overall, fairly well laid out, as these things go, not overly crowded with crap, as are some I could name, and it didn’t take a hundred years to load, as do others I could mention. And I found her name on the masthead, although not listed as a ‘senior editor.’ But I didn’t find a single report anywhere about breast cancer, or even about Komen’s latest nonsense with pink drill bits. And worst of all, I couldn’t find a search box either, so I couldn’t check the archives for the past few weeks since the month-of-pink-overload began. What kind of self-respecting media site doesn’t have a search box? Whatever ‘robust’ content they have planned, they better hurry up with it before the damn month is over. Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my! I was never one of the really popular kids at school. But I always had a loyal band of misfit friends who stuck together. What we had going for us is that we were always nice to other misfits, and we knew how to laugh, and we mostly recognized bullshit when we smelled it. Not so different from how my life as a blogger is now, really. Of course, I’m very grateful that people bother to read and enjoy my blog at all. Wouldn’t be half as much fun to write if they didn’t. But when you’ve been bullied from a young age by the ‘popular’ kids, and you’ve survived with your psyche more or less intact, you tend to grow up to be the sort of adult who doesn’t give a big, fat rodent’s derriere whether you’re popular or not. And you still tend to smell bullshit a mile away, or, at the very least, employ a certain healthy skepticism. I’ve come to view these qualities as advantageous in the social media world, as helping me preserve a little objectivity when I’m exploring certain subjects on this blog. I like to think I can trust myself not to get exploited by someone for their own self-serving purposes. But maybe I’m just paranoid. My mother had a personality disorder that caused her to see conspiracies everywhere, so you never know. Perhaps I’m not so much skeptical as delusional. I’ve been accused of worse. But I can tell you, without delusion, that in the past month, I’ve received every manner of request to get me to lend my name, blog space, time, ideas, and tacit or explicit endorsement to all sorts of exploits. And these are just the few that have escaped my vigorous spam filter. Some of them are fairly harmless. Some are legit. But a lot of them amount to sales pitches, delivered under the guise of ‘supporting breast cancer awareness.’ I know for a certainty that I’m not the only one who’s received these requests. I know that many, if not most, of these people making these requests just do some kind of Google search for ‘breast cancer blogs’ and go to town. Hence, they do not make me feel special. Or popular. I’ve received several requests to review as-yet-unpublished book manuscripts. These are generally sent by other members of the cancer club who have written a memoir or a novelized memoir. These requests are a little heart-breaking. All of these authors mention how they wouldn’t have gotten through their ordeals without the laughter and support of their friends, bolstered by cake, retail therapy, or trips to the local day-spa, which, it must be said, was basically my strategy. One would presume they asked their friends to read their stories first. But after that, why not then find one of the several professional editors out there who make a living reviewing manuscripts? Why ask me? Sure, I used to be a professional editor, almost thirty years ago, but there are only fourteen people in the world who know that. Likewise, I’ve also gotten a few requests to review and endorse songs, written to encourage us during Pinktober. I can always use a little encouragement, musical and otherwise. But generally, I turn to music that has nothing to do with cancer when I’m feeling disgruntled. Somehow I doubt these folks sending me iTune links know that I tried to be a rock star in my youth, or that I’ve written and recorded a number of songs that parody the experience of enduring cancer treatment and the barrage of pinkwashing that’s gone with it. Frankly, I’d rather watch a Weird Al video than listen to yet another person telling me what a hero I am. Bleck. Then there are the requests to exchange links and/or to post something about some splendid product that is sure to make my life as a cancer patient much more tolerable. These include cookbooks, Japanese dietary supplements, and special services for breast cancer patients like retreats to find one’s ‘inner warrior.’ One of the more entertaining of these was for a wrist band (pink, naturally) infused with peppermint to be worn over a certain pressure point on the wrist, which is supposed to help control nausea. One may order these wristbands at a discount by visiting their website and entering the code ‘SAVBOOBS.’ Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Among the more insidious offers are invitations to visit sites that are presented as supportive, informational online venues designed to help patients figure out if they are being adequately tested after initial diagnosis. They have names like KnowYOURBreastCancer.com and MyBreastCancerTreatment.org. Far be it from me, a staunch advocate of informed consent, to eschew gathering as much information as possible when one has been told one’s biopsy is positive. The two sites mentioned describe the benefits of molecular diagnostic testing, specifically the Oncotype DX test, which can be used to help determine whether chemotherapy would be beneficial, and to calculate a recurrence risk for those with early-stage breast cancers, including the risk for invasive recurrence with DCIS. Not a thing wrong with that. There are a few things about these sites that I do take issue with, however. One is the fine print. Unless you look for it, you’d easily miss the fact that each of these sites is maintained by companies who manufacture such tests, Agendia in the former case, Genomic Health in the latter. They are not the only companies who make molecular diagnostic tests for breast cancer, but these two want you to ask your doctor to request their tests. To my mind, this occupies the same continuum of advertising as those ubiquitous drug commercials on TV that encourage you to tell your doctor to prescribe a specific medication for heartburn, say, or arthritis. To that end, additionally, both Agendia and Genomic Health have Facebook communities. Agendia’s is called Symphony Sisterhood for Breast Cancer, the ‘Symphony’ being a panel of four tests that analyze breast tumors. Genomic’s Facebook community is called Until Every Woman Knows. Both Facebook pages invite individual women to share their stories. I received an email invitation last week from a PR firm to allow myself to be featured on one of these Facebook pages as a way “to honor people who are using social media to raise awareness about breast cancer.” Several dogged minutes’ worth of investigation brought me to the corporation behind the invite. But I didn’t find it on their Facebook page. In the ‘About’ section of both of these community pages, the corporate names behind them are not mentioned. Somewhere over the rainbow. Regular readers of this blog know what a snarky bitch I am. Appropriately enough, the last time I used The Wizard of Oz metaphorically was in another post about the risks of exploitation by social media. But, however much I may let the fur fly here, I do try not to be unnecessarily rude to individuals. I politely declined the invite from the PR firm, saying that I did not normally allow any corporation to use my name or blog, because occasionally, I write reviews of research about such things as molecular diagnostics, and I would prefer to maintain my distance and objectivity. The response to this was an offer of links and videos describing the research their client had done about their products. There was some back-and-forth on this, but overall, it was a cordial exchange, devoid of snippiness. We’re all grownups here in the blogosphere, and each of us has to decide for herself how to manage her social media presence. Me? I’m still the kid who was bullied as a child, who’s grown up to be a perennial skeptic. I like to think I’m occasionally performing a kind of public service, but maybe I really am just paranoid and deluded. “…If I only had a brain I’d unravel any riddle For any individ’le In trouble or in pain…” Posted in: Attitude, Diagnosis, Recurrence, Screening, Fighting the Pink Peril by Kathi 23 Comments blogging, breast cancer, breast cancer awareness month, pinksploitation, social media",1,1,0.10192944658222436
188,26,27,[Timestamp('2014-09-29 00:00:00')],"Published at: 12:09 pm - September 29, 2014 It’s not even October yet. About ten days ago, I got a call first thing in the morning on my house phone. The people I really want to hear from usually call me on my cellphone, and telemarketers are the folks who usually call the house phone. But occasionally, one of my doctors will call the house phone, and I was waiting on some test results (again), so I picked up the phone. “Hello?” I said, and waited. I didn’t hear any background voices or any of those funny noises that herald an auto-dialer. So far, so good. “Is this Ms. Kolb?” A female voice. I never answer that question directly. If they ask, “Is this Mrs. Kolb, I usually say, “There’s no Mrs. Kolb here,” which is the literal truth, and hang up. What I said this time was, “Who’s calling, please?” “My name is Hoozit Something-or-other. I’m a representative from Corporations for Character and I’m calling on behalf of the Breast Cancer Financial Assistance Fund. Many women with breast cancer suffer a significant financial impact and need help to pay their bills. Blah, blah, blah…” I interrupted her. “I’m only going to say this once, so just listen, don’t say another word, and grab your pencil. I don’t know how you got my name or number, but I have some ideas. I’m one of those women with breast cancer who’ve suffered a significant financial impact. I’m going to give you an email address, so write this down. You are welcome to email me some information and links, and I will review and research them, and if I decide you are legitimate, I may write a blog post about your organization. And if I decide you are NOT legitimate, I’ll write about that…” Foolishly, she interrupted me. She was not, I’m certain, waiting with her pencil poised to take down my email address. “Oh! I’m so sorry! You are just the sort of person we’re trying to reach. Our organization…blah, blah, blah…” “I told you not to say another word. Would you like my email address or not?” “…and we’re trying to raise more funds and get the word out to the thousands of women in this country that…” “You’re not listening, are you? Neither am I. Don’t ever call me again.” Slam. The great thing about still having a regular phone is that you can slam it when you hang up on someone. Sharks and tornadoes. I’ve researched the legitimacy of countless breast cancer organizations, including those who offer financial help. There’s no doubt that many of us go broke having cancer and could use some cash while we’re waiting for a cure. [See Broke: The Cost of Breast Cancer.] The last time I googled ‘breast cancer organizations,’ I got nine million hits. When I googled ‘breast cancer charity organizations list’ just now, I got three-and-a-half million hits. A lot of those hits were for groups that monitor such charities and who attempt to separate the good from the dross. Needless to say, it’s impossible for one blogger to keep up with the dross. But after that ridiculous phone call, I did look up the Breast Cancer Financial Assistance Fund. Their website is in ‘maintenance mode.’ But I did find this: One of the Nation’s Worst Charities: Right Here!, a post published by the Utah Better Business Bureau just this year on April 22, 2014. And this, by Maggie Freleng, Breast Cancer Scams: The Worst Charities Include 5 Pink Types, posted a year ago. The bottom line is that the BCFAF is essentially a scam group that is part of another scam group called the Cancer Fund of America. From the BBB article: BCFAF not only has been the subject of numerous legal actions by government entities, it was recently spotlighted in a detailed investigative report by the Tampa Bay Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting as the Second Worst Charity in the United States. Cancer Fund of America also known as BCFAF was also the subject of a 2009 news warning from BBB in St. Louis.[…] BBB research shows that Cancer Fund of America, also known as, BCFAF hired Corporations for Character to solicit for donations via telephone. According to the 2012 IRS Form 990 for Cancer Fund of America, also known as BCFAF, Corporations for Character raised $448,276 and kept $410,996 with $37,280 (or a little over 8%) going to the charity. Corporations for Character and Feature Films for Families are also the subject of a May 9, 2011, complaint in which the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice allege the defendants made 16 million calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry and misrepresented how funds would be used. Just to add insult to injury, I had also just received a snailmail solicitation from Bank of America for their Pink Ribbon BankAmericard MasterCard. Bank of America has earned its own list of reports about fraudulent practices, including this, by Mike Taibbi of Rolling Stone, about BOA’s role in the 2008 economic crisis: Bank of America: Too Crooked to Fail. However, never let it be said that corporate pinkwashing has gone out of style. According to BOA’s webpage, if you get their Pink Ribbon credit card, you can Join the fight against breast cancer and earn cash back, too[…] For each new Susan G. Komen®-branded credit card account opened and activated, Komen receives a minimum of $3 and 0.20% of all net retail purchases made with the card. For example, 20 cents for every $100. Komen also receives $1 for each annual renewal of the card. Wow, a whole two tenths of a percent! I mean, just think how many useless pink tchotchkes you could buy with $100! And with 20 cents going to Komen, that cure ought to be discovered any day now, eh? People, the sharks are out there. And they’ve started early. ~ A few alternate suggestions. These folks will spend your donations legitimately: Breast Cancer Action; see their Think Before You Pink page. METAvivor, which funds research for metastatic breast cancer. Oh, and apologies to the Sharknado folks for altering your poster. �� Posted in: Fighting the Pink Peril by Kathi 32 Comments breast cancer awareness month, financial stress of cancer, fraudulent fundraising, fundraising, Marketing ripoff, Pinktober, pinkwashing, the cost of cancer, Think Before You Pink",1,-1,-0.0007954545454545478

191,26,3,[Timestamp('2016-02-28 00:00:00')],"Published at: 03:02 pm - February 28, 2016 Being a breast cancer patient can be lonely. Even with supportive friends and family, no one really knows what it’s like to endure the shock, anger, grief, and stress of being diagnosed with cancer, and then to undergo the scorched-earth treatment of it. No one knows what it’s like to put up with exhortations to ‘stay positive’ and ‘be brave’ when you feel like a train wreck. No one knows how you feel when you are surrounded by marketing images that trivialize your disease, that dress up its harsh reality in a gloss of pink. But suppose you had a kind and thoughtful friend who had also gone through it. Suppose you got to sit down with her and talk for hours. Suppose you could ask her every question you could think of, and finally get to hear all the details of her experience, delivered straight-up, without the pretty-in-pink nonsense that leaves you feeling isolated and ignored. Finally, you think. Someone who really gets it! That’s what it’s like to read Nancy Stordahl’s memoir, Cancer Was Not a Gift & It Didn’t Make Me a Better Person. Many of us have gotten to know Nancy from her popular blog, Nancy’s Point. I came upon her blog some time in 2011, and was struck from the start by her honest, unvarnished prose. We quickly became cyber-friends. Like many of her long-time readers and blog-sisters, we’ve come to know a lot about each other over the years. But, as with any friend, you want to know more. Reading her memoir was, therefore, an opportunity to get answers to all those questions I would ask her if she and I were sitting together in person, with nothing but time to commiserate. Without giving too much away, I will say that one of the most poignant aspects of Nancy’s memoir is how she weaves the story of her mother’s experience with breast cancer into the threads of her own. As I read, I kept thinking of how such a circumstance would magnify the anguish, and about how many women have gone through exactly that anguish. Bad enough to watch your own mother experience its ravages, but then to be diagnosed yourself? Hell on earth. All these years after my own diagnosis, I find I can only stand to read precious few books about cancer. After treating cancer patients all day in my job as a physical therapist, after writing this blog for seven years, after reading countless blog posts and research articles, after losing so many friends, sometimes the last thing I want to do in a spare moment is to read another book about it. I’ve lost count of how many blog posts I’ve written rejecting the notion that cancer is some kind of blessing, or some sort of opportunity to build one’s character. In fact, I was writing about these and other aspects of breast cancer, and often feeling like one of the lone voices in the pink wilderness, before Nancy was diagnosed herself in April of 2010, and before she started her blog some months later. Although I hated discovering that yet another vital person had been diagnosed, it was a tremendous relief to find Nancy’s blog, and to know that someone else was willing and able to speak to these and many other issues from a similar perspective. The title of Nancy’s memoir says it all. How could I not read it? And I’m glad I did. Any good memoir underscores the truth that the personal is universal. And so it is with Nancy’s memoir. If you’ve ever loved someone with breast cancer, cared for someone with breast cancer, faced the implications of BRCA gene mutations, or had breast cancer yourself, you will find something that resonates with your own experience. Even if none of the above applies to you, if you want to understand, to get past the deceptive tyranny of Pinktober, or to learn about the reality of facing a life-changing catatrophe, you will learn much from Nancy. As she states in her introduction, Nancy’s intent is to share her own story about ‘cancer as I know it[…] because sharing is healing, empowering and hopefully helps us all feel less alone.’ Read it, and you will find a friend in the storm.

193,26,31,[Timestamp('2013-10-30 00:00:00')],"Published at: 03:10 pm - October 30, 2013 So, I was thinking, where is all the pink crap likely to end up anyway? You know, like, a hundred years from now… ~~ New York Times, October 30, 2113: Archaeologists working at a dig in a Texas landfill have come upon a strange layer of pink artifacts, including weapons, appliances, clothing and other peculiar items, believed to be part of a failed subculture estimated to be nearly 100 years old. Several teeshirts, covered in oddly sexual slogans, have been submitted for carbon dating. Historians researching the immediate area stated that the landfill is located close to what is believed to be the original site of a long-defunct organization called the Susan G. Komen Foundation. “In the early 21st century,” stated one archaeologist, “it was apparently believed that encouraging corporations and manufacturers to produce and sell pink merchandise would somehow lead to a cure for breast cancer. Ultimately, it was discovered that much of this merchandise contained carcinogens that in fact contributed to the disease. There is still much to discover about this now-extinct cultural anomaly.” Archaeologists comb through a Texas landfill. ~~ Well, we can only dream… Apologies to www.warmingtonheritage.com for tarting up their ‘Meet the Archaeologist’ photo.

194,26,32,[Timestamp('2013-10-13 00:00:00')],"Published at: 05:10 pm - October 13, 2013 Today is Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day, the one day in this month of pernicious pinkification set aside to acknowledge the Elephant in the Pink Room. I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m aware of MBC every damn day of the year… Because I have this list… Five years ago, shortly after I was diagnosed, I found my way to an online peer-support forum for people with breast cancer. It’s no exaggeration to say that it saved my sanity. Alone, at home, often in the middle of the night, enduring and trying to recover from treatment, the women and men I met on this forum were always there, sharing bad jokes, outrage, anxiety, as well as affection, cogent advice, compassion, and generosity. One of those forum-friends was Diane. This was the autumn of 2008, when the fallout from the U.S. and global financial crisis was crashing down around our ears. I was one of the ‘lucky’ ones, relatively speaking. I had a job with health insurance and disability insurance and paid sick time. A lot of my sisters and brothers on the forum were not so lucky. One of those unlucky forum-friends was Diane. The following tells the tale: “As we watch politicians & bureaucrats argue about the best way to help home-owners keep their homes and prevent millions more Americans from losing their jobs, some of our friends on the forum are living with the real consequences of the U.S. financial crisis. Diane is one of those friends. While she and her husband have been waiting weeks for word on whether they can refinance their mortgage and prevent foreclosure, Diane’s husband was laid off from his job, just one week before Christmas.” Some of us decided to try to help. I already had a website (for my photography), so I offered to add a fundraising page with a PayPal link for Diane and her family. The above was taken from that page. Within days, we raised over $1400. The money allowed Diane and her husband to pay their bills for the month, including the mortgage, buy Christmas presents for their young sons, and give them time to find a non-profit group that helped them refinance their home. Her husband was also able to find another job. Eventually, Diane’s breast cancer returned and metastasized. In February of 2010, Diane died of metastatic breast cancer. A few years ago, the phrase ‘fearless friend’ was coined. I believe that perhaps my late friend and sister bitch-blogger Rachel may have first mentioned it in a blog post. Someone with a better memory than mine (!) might enlighten me in a comment. In any case, it gained a hashtag and quickly spread among those of us who participate in the #BCSM Monday night Tweetchat. A fearless friend is someone who does not have metastatic breast cancer, but who pledges herself to step up and support her friends who do, however she can. There’s a large subset of us fearless friends who have also been diagnosed with breast cancer ourselves but, so far, manage to stay in the land of NED (No Evidence of Disease). I’m not sure how fearless I truly feel much of the time. But for me, being a #fearlessfriend means being a friend in spite of my fear — fear for my friends with mets, fear for my friends who have recurrences, fear for all of us who’ve had this diagnosis, who could develop mets in the future. In another February, in 2012, Rachel died. A week later, I went to her funeral. There’s nothing quite like soul-searing loss to amplify your feelings of helplessness and futility. You want to DO something, anything, to keep it from happening again. I knew I could keep blogging — and I did keep blogging — but I wrote in a haze of heartache. I so admire the drive and commitment of many of my friends in our cyber-community whose grief over Rachel’s death helped drive them to push harder for real awareness of MBC. They’ve managed to agitate, advocate, go to conferences, write articles, publish books, start groups, raise money for metastatic breast cancer research, enriching and enlarging our e-community. The circumstances of my own life, however, did not permit me to take on any further commitments. But I still wanted to do something. So I offered my geekitude to METAvivor, one of the organizations Rachel most admired and supported, and launched their blog in April of last year. It didn’t seem like much, but it was something. Blog-Admins-R-Us. Please visit our baby. There’s a great post there today, written by CJ, that we hope will be the first of several this month. As usual, the run-up to the corporate merchandizing field-day known as Breast Cancer Awareness Month started early. As usual, there have been even more execrable, tacky and tactless fundraising campaigns and pink products than there were last year. Some of them truly beggar belief. One of the most idiotic is ‘No Bra Day,’ which happens to be today. Nice timing, asshats. If the saying, ‘there’s no such thing as bad press’ is true, then NBD was a rousing success, since it raised the ire of many of us bloggers, who were not shy about articulating our collective disgust in the blogosphere. My friend the Feisty Blue Gecko summed it up for many of us. Personally, if I go without a bra in public today, I plan to clip my prosthesis on the outside of my shirt. That ought to raise some awareness. Another friend, AnneMarie, who advocates, agitates, tirelessly kicks butt and blogs at Chemobrain, stumbled upon yet another astonishing fundraising notice this year. I didn’t really want to include the jpg, but you probably wouldn’t believe me unless I showed it to you. I don’t even know what to say about this myself. What’s the message here? Breast cancer might kill you, but at least you can go out with a smile on your face? Yeah, right. It’s times like this when I wish I were better at channeling Rachel, who would no doubt come up with some apposite snark. Meanwhile, less than two weeks ago, on September 30th, there was another funeral. It was live-streamed from England. It had been arranged by the long-time partner of another woman I’ve known for five years, whom I also met on the peer-support forum, and later, kept in touch with on Facebook. Her name was Jayne. She was a gentle, unfailingly kind, completely dear human being. Her breast cancer recurred, then metastasized, and finally took her life. Just yesterday, there was a funeral for Angie Suttles. For fifteen years, she endured breast cancer, reached out to countless individuals and groups, shared her time and her story, and worked as a regional leader for Livestrong. She was known to many of us online, through social media and through her blog. Her son Caleb was kind enough to keep us informed, allow us to participate in a video he created with our messages, and arrange for the live-stream of her service. Bloody hell. The longer I participate in our amazing community, the longer my list becomes. Some on the list are recent friends, some are friends I’ve known for years now, some are patients I’ve treated over the years, some have been relatives. There are friends who weren’t on the list when I first knew them, but are now. Friends who have died. Friends who are hanging in there, hoping their current treatment will keep their mets at bay. Friends who keep working, at least some of the time, and friends who have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. Friends in pain every day. Friends who try their level best not to let metastatic breast cancer subsume their identities. Friends who laugh, make art, write blogs, cause trouble, who advocate, educate, kick major ass. Friends who take care of children, parents, spouses in spite of mets. Friends who have lost mothers, sisters, and other loved ones to mets. Friends I’ve met in person, friends I’ve met in cyberspace. Friends I communicate with daily. Friends I love, adore, admire, learn from, snark with, laugh with, share stupid photos of my cats with. Friends I worry about, cry for, rage for. Friends I don’t want to mourn for. Am I truly fearless? Not really. But I hope I’m at least a kind and conscious friend, and a decent clinician. I can’t always do much, but I can do that. And I can refuse to let fear rule my head and heart. I can speak out and write and draw and make jokes. I can treat my patients with a fuller knowledge of what they might need. And be grateful for how much my life has been immeasurably enriched by every single person on my list. What’s a little fear compared to that?

195,26,33,[Timestamp('2013-09-29 00:00:00')],"Published at: 01:09 pm - September 29, 2013 Really, I don’t even want to be writing this post. One of the most heart-rending blog tasks I’ve had to do this past week is to re-categorize a few of the links to blogs on my blogroll, to reflect the fact that the women who write them have been diagnosed with mets since I first connected with them in the blogosphere. That stopped me in my tracks. And my list of bloggers with mets keeps getting longer. It’s no wonder, then, that I’m so sick of the explosion of corporate merchandising known as ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’ — aka Pinktober — I resent even acknowledging its existence. But I’ll force myself to post some random observations, a few facts, and some links. As usual, I will avoid shopping in certain places for the next month. The above collage is comprised almost entirely of photos I took myself on one particularly hideous October Saturday a few years ago, as I ventured forth to do a few errands. If anyone would care to tell me how selling pink Chia heads (yes, I really saw them; they are in the center of the above banner) has contributed to figuring out what causes breast cancer or how to cure breast cancer or how to prevent anyone from developing metastatic breast cancer and dying of breast cancer, do let me know. I’m always eager to advance my knowledge. A casual friend of mine recently launched a small fundraising initiative with a friend of hers. They are selling tiny pink cat tchotchkes to raise money for our local breast health center and a local breast cancer support organization. Our local breast health center is a pretty good place, all in all. Friends and colleagues and patients of mine have been treated there. The friend who launched this initiative was treated there. The center has had patient navigators for a few years now. The center welcomes patient feedback about their cancer experience and acts on that feedback. Their navigators bust their butts. One of them had breast cancer herself and I marvel at her energy. I believe very much in supporting local entities, and our breast health center is certainly one worth supporting. However, I confess that the name of this fundraising initiative made me cringe. It’s called ‘Kitties for Titties.’ I don’t think this friend has read my blog, and if I run into her in the next month, I’m not quite sure what I will say if she asks me to buy a pink kitty. I may be a snarky bitch here on the blog, and I’m often snarkily bitchy WITH my friends. But I really try not to be snarkily bitchy TO my friends. Most of my friends feel the same way I do about Pinktober, but clearly not all. The ones who don’t represent a bit of a dilemma. On the plus side, I’m pretty sure that most, if not all, of the money raised, which is $4 per kitty, is being donated to the stated causes. Certainly no one is getting a six-figure administrative salary out of this endeavor, like certain other Pink Pushers I could name. But, well, they are pink kitties. Little chubby kitties. Sort of like ‘Hello Kitty’ kitties. When you see them, you’re supposed to think they’re cute. So, I’m not sure what the message is, really. Because, you know, I’ve always thought that breast cancer is way un-cute. And then there’s the titties part. One of the euphemisms for women’s breasts that I hate most is ‘tits’ or ‘titties.’ Not sure why. Maybe it’s because most of the times I’ve ever heard it used, it’s been uttered by asshat, objectifying slobs, fantasizing about snagging a quick lay. I know, I know. What is my problem, huh? I mean, normally, I don’t object to trivializing a life-threatening disease, not to mention the women’s body parts affected by that disease. And surely it would be gauche to point out that a large percentage of women treated for breast cancer no longer have either one or both of their original ‘titties,’ because, well, they were more interested in saving their lives than keeping their diseased breasts. But, hey, that’s probably just me feeling like Grumpy Kat. And then there’s the current kerfuffle playing out in Congress. Basically, the Republicans in the House of Representatives want to repeal the Affordable Care Act in exchange for passing a stopgap funding bill to raise the debt ceiling temporarily so that the U.S. can keep paying its bills. Meanwhile, some of the initial provisions of the ACA are in the process of being enacted, with lots of attendant hyperbole, hysteria and misinformation promulgated by those who oppose it. So, in response to the naysayers, I would just like to point out a few things. The ACA abolishes the practice of denying health insurance to people with pre-existing conditions, and cancer, last time I checked, is regarded as a pre-existing condition. So, I’m all for ensuring that I and thousands of other American citizens can get and keep our health insurance. Also, people with metastatic breast cancer and no insurance can get Medicare coverage, even if they are not 65. Several diseases, including cancer, are included under the ‘compassionate allowance’ provision for Medicare coverage through the Social Security Administration, through which people with mets can also apply for disability income. It’s good to know that there is still some compassion left in Washington, D.C., despite Congressional evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, back in the land of the Pink Peril, there is still only one day in Pinktober set aside to acknowledge metastatic breast cancer. It’s October 13th, for those keeping score at home. That’s one day to acknowledge that, worldwide, about 458,000 women and men are still dying of MBC every year. One day. Pathetic. Maybe it’s me being Grumpy Kat again, but this points to the central problem with Pinktober. It seems to me that the main reason why the public needs to be aware of breast cancer — or any cancer, for the matter — is because people die of it. But awareness of breast cancer is so last century at this point. What we need is cogent, accurate awareness about breast cancer, awareness about its causes; awareness about the continuing inadequacies of mammography, still the most prevalent screening tool used to detect it; awareness about the life-altering and lifelong collateral damage caused by getting treated for breast cancer; awareness about how and why it metastasizes and how to prevent it from doing so; awareness about the financial, physical and emotional toll that all cancer patients live with forever; awareness about what it means to live with metastatic breast cancer and to wonder how long your current treatment will continue to keep the beast at bay. None of this is cute, pink, fluffy, sexy, or ultimately even about losing our breasts. By my criteria, most of what passes for breast cancer awareness during the month of October scarcely passes muster. Much of it is pure baloney, or worse, disseminates misleading statistics and woefully inaccurate information. Most of it is an industry, a corporate merchandising opportunity, that provides little tangible help to those who are dealing with breast cancer. And still, in the U.S., despite the fact that 30% of those diagnosed with breast cancer will develop metastases, only 2% of the millions raised for breast cancer research goes to researching metastatic breast cancer. And that much-vaunted cure certain folks have promised? Nowhere in sight. If I listed every pertinent link I could think of, I’d have an encyclopedia. So, here’s a few. Also, check out my blogroll if you want the unvarnished truth from those who live with mets.

198,26,36,[Timestamp('2013-04-04 00:00:00')],"Published at: 02:04 pm - April 04, 2013 In three months, it will have been five years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I started this blog over four years ago, shortly after acute treatment was finished and I’d returned to work. At first, it was a way to sort out the aftermath and help me convince myself that I’d be okay. It was a way to wrestle the Monster down to a manageable size, to laugh at it, to provide a voice of skepticism and candor in the face of the Positivity Pollyannas whose tyranny did not reflect my reality. As time went on, the blog became a lot more — a place to research and write about the collateral damage of cancer treatment, to comment on the massive pink merchandising and sexualization of breast cancer, to decipher hype about research findings, and to provide some practical and hopefully useful information for others coping with pain, misery, fatigue, depression and all the other myriad facets of ‘surviving’ cancer and its treatment. It also became a way to pay it forward, to give something back. The best thing about it is that it became a conversation. It connected me to a remarkable and worldwide community of like-minded souls. That conversation has been hugely nourishing. I’ve made lifelong friends through the blogosphere and social media. I’ve learned a tremendous amount about the strength, love, intelligence and generosity of our online community, and that has helped me keep my sanity. It also helped me redefine my focus at work. As I visit my homecare patients, the extensive research I’ve undertaken to write so many blog posts provided me with a lot more tools as I’ve provided physical therapy and case management to an increasing number of cancer patients. Four months after I started the blog, I participated in clinical training for oncology rehab. Since then, I’ve participated in a number of research projects as a subject, gone to advocacy seminars, and gained further professional certification for oncology rehab. All the while, I continued to grapple with fatigue, brain fog, daily pain, and even a close encounter with non-invasive colon cancer. Far and away, the most painful struggle has been to come to terms with how many friends have developed metastatic cancer, to mourn the deaths of so many friends from cancer, friends I’ve made through the blogosphere and through my life and work. The sum total of all of this has brought me to a crossroads that has taken me months to define and articulate. It’s still hard to put words to it, but something has changed. I’ve changed. And I need to shift the path I’m on to figure out what it means. The path I need to choose now is likely to lead me away from blogging for a while. I don’t know for how long. It might be weeks. It might be months. It’s not for lack of subjects to write about or, strictly speaking, for lack of desire to write about them. It’s more that I need to nourish myself differently right now. There’s been nothing light-hearted about the journey I’ve been on. Even at the height of my snarkitude, which has been immensely fun, the burden of carting this cancer freight in my consciousness has been heavy. And growing heavier. I find myself needing to lighten the load for a while, or shift it somehow, so I do not find myself crushed by the weight of it. Part of what has nourished me for so long by writing this blog has started to deplete me, not nourish me. It’s hard to admit that — it makes me feel like I’m giving up. But I remind myself that the blog is not the only vehicle by which I can pay it forward and help others. I do it at work every day. And for now, that has to be enough. The uber-awareness I’ve developed by writing here needs to be counterbalanced. I had no choice about accepting how much cancer took over my life since 2008. I’ve lost so much of myself since then that I feel almost unrecognizable when I examine what my everyday life has become. But now, it’s time to take back more of those parts of my life that have been on hold. For a long time, I was hard-pressed to do so. The good news is that now I finally feel capable of doing so. That is a sign of healing. I know that my next doctor visit, my next scan, my next mammogram or lab test or colonoscopy could change things all over again and drop me right back in the ditch. We always live with that possibility. But for now, while I am lucky enough to occupy that magical place known as No Evidence of Disease, I’m going to endeavor, as much as I’m capable of, to live without looking over my shoulder. In short, I need to remember how to play. So, I’ve been re-acquainting myself with my sense of wonder. I’ve been trying to repair my social life. I’ve been reconnecting with my inner child, the child I described in my last post, who followed her passions and curiosity, and explored the world. So much of my life has been interior these past five years. Now, it’s time to get outside of myself again. I’m giving myself permission to remember who I am, a woman who is not just a cancer patient. I want to write just for the sheer pleasure of it, not to make a point or an argument. Not to vent. I want to write about something besides cancer. I want to write more poetry, more stories that are not about grief. I want to make more art and dust off the sewing machine and reorganize my studio and plant flowers. I want to clean my closets, metaphorically and literally. I want to spend more time with the people I love and NOT talk about how I’m feeling in relation to cancer, but in relation to life itself. I want to set up my father’s old telescope and look at the stars. I want to have parties and cook extravagant meals and go for long drives and read books that aren’t about cancer and draw with crayons and colored pencils. I want to dream dreams again. I want to make plans that don’t involve fear and doctors. I want to kick my way out of the cancer morass and become myself again. And when I do, I’ve no doubt I’ll be back here, better, clearer. I want to go out and play. And I think that finally, at long last, I can. And that makes all the difference.

204,26,41,[Timestamp('2013-02-06 00:00:00')],"Published at: 03:02 pm - February 06, 2013 The Rebel Bloggers of NBCC 2011 To those three or four people out there who still doubt the power of social media, perhaps this post will erase your skepticism forever. One year ago today, on February 6, 2012, Susan Niebur and Rachel Cheetham Moro both died of metastatic breast cancer. Susan was 39. Rachel was 41. A stunned sorrow was felt quite literally by thousands of people around the world. I had the great good fortune to meet both of them in person, at the 2011 National Breast Cancer Coalition Conference in Washington, D.C., Susan by serendipity, Rachel by design. It was my first encounter with Susan, and frankly, when I learned about her broad and influential social media presence, I was astonished that I had not discovered her before. Rachel and I met because we planned to meet, along with three other bloggers who’d become good cyber-friends, to get to know each other in the real world. Among the hundreds of attendees at that conference, we were part of a small but august group of cheerfully troublesome, not-entirely-well-behaved breast cancer bloggers. We were not all known to one another before then, but somehow, no doubt emanating highly-tuned social media vibes, we managed to find one another. We gravitated to a table near the back and off to the side of the main conference room, where we could be close to the wall outlets and keep our cell phones and laptops charged up. And also, truth be told, we were the naughty kids in the classroom, and our corner allowed us to giggle and grumble and snap pictures of each other. And ask pointed questions. And become friends. My Favorite Astrophysicist Susan, I soon learned, had metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. I also learned that she was not only a prolific blogger, but an astrophysicist. A sister blogger AND a sister science nerd! She was certainly the only one of us to have a profile on the website for NASA, her former employer. During a trip with her parents to the Johnson Space Center in Texas, when she was a mere three years old, she noticed that there weren’t any women in the photos of astronauts. She decided there and then to rectify that omission and become one herself. In 2003, she realized her dream and joined the NASA staff as a scientist for the Discover Program. She didn’t end up on a rocket ship, but she was a card-carrying rocket scientist. When she left NASA in 2006 after the birth of her first child, she continued to consult for them. One of her NASA-funded research projects led her to start the blog Women in Planetary Science, and to organize the first Women’s Networking Breakfast at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. In her profile interview on the NASA site, she said, “I wanted to gather the women together to address issues that I’d heard discussed year after year in the hallways and in the bathrooms — frustrations with the difficulties inherent in the field, such as getting funding, changing jobs, serving on missions, and balancing work and family; difficulties that are only made worse by the fact that most of the women in this field are also married to men working in the field or in closely related disciplines. It was a gamble, but it paid off — we had over 100 women attend, and they were eager to share their concerns and work towards resolving them in ways that helped the community as a whole.[…] Now the breakfast is an annual event, attended by 150-plus women, including management from NASA headquarters. It is thrilling to see a room full of energetic, passionate women mentoring each other in real-time and making plans to do more throughout the year — and to have NASA headquarters there too, listening.” She was passionate about getting more women and girls involved in science, math and technology. As the mother of two small boys, she was also passionate about parenting and about encouraging every child’s sense of curiosity and exploration, leading to her Twitter moniker @WhyMommy. As a woman with breast cancer, she was driven to raise awareness about her own disease, inflammatory breast cancer, a pernicious and aggressive form of cancer. Like Rachel, she spoke eloquently and candidly about the reality of living with metastatic breast cancer and about the trivialization and ignorance of metastatic disease in a culture rife with pink merchandise marketing. She started a half dozen blogs and websites, wrote and published articles, and was invited to speak, on all of the above concerns and more, by many groups and organizations. Her achievements won awards and grants, including one for her blog Toddler Planet from Bloganthropy.org. She was particularly beloved by a group of women in her home town of Washington called The DC Moms. I encourage you all to visit her site, SusanNiebur.com, to find links to her many blogs and activities, and read more about her remarkable life. How she managed all this while dealing with the ravages of her disease is little short of a miracle. But she did, with grace, dignity, and deceptively gentle, often humorous, wisdom. Love That’s Really Real Sometime during the month of October, 2010, both Rachel and I, then unknown to one another, discovered the perfect antidote to the pinkwashing and exploitative marketing that had perverted breast cancer awareness. It was a book called Pink Ribbon Blues, written by activist and sociologist Gayle Sulik. Each of us contacted Gayle to convey our enthusiastic approbation, and that initial communication grew into cyber-friendship among a group of us rebel bloggers, who came to use every means of cyber contact at our disposal to brainstorm, offer support, and encourage one another to keep exposing the insidious flaws and insults of what I came to call the Pink Peril. Inevitably, Rach and I discovered each other’s blogs, along with a shared love for our dogs, and a mutual propensity to use parody, humor, farce, and, above all, hard evidence, to skewer Pinktober. Like Susan, Rachel was a math whiz. Originally from Australia, she travelled to countless countries, including a bicycle trip in Viet Nam, a safari in South Africa, and a month in Tuscany. She channelled her considerable analytic abilities into becoming an accountant, certainly flouting the stereotype of that profession that depicts its members as dry, humorless bean-counters. While on a trip to London, she met her future husband, Anthony, and, after many more travels together, eventually moved to New York, where she attended Fordham and subsequently worked for one of the premier accountancy firms in Manhattan. She adopted a puppy, whom she named Newman. Soon, she and Anthony bought a house on the New Jersey coast. An avid gardener, Rachel planned and planted her much-beloved garden. She taught herself to become a gourmet cook. She worked, kept in touch with an enormous and dedicated group of friends and family members. She lived every minute with joy, vivacity, humor and love. Just as she and Anthony were reaffirming their life together, Rachel was diagnosed with breast cancer. She tackled it as she tackled the rest of her life, with gusto and confidence. Finally, it appeared that her cancer was in remission. But not for long. On June 2, 2009, she wrote her first blog post, on the eve of a doctor’s appointment during which she would hear that her cancer had returned. And would never leave. As many would discover — and still discover — Rachel soon began to apply her formidable intellect to the breast cancer culture. She wrote movingly, bluntly, often humorously, and always incisively about the realities of living with metastatic disease. Two of her most far-reaching blog posts, Komen by the Numbers and its follow-up, Komen by the Numbers: 2010 and Still No Answers, both written in early 2011, are still quoted and cited by bloggers, authors and journalists who seek to expose the glaring contradictions and misguided priorities demonstrated not only by fundraising groups like Komen, but the entire culture of pinksploitation. She forged everlasting bonds of comradeship, support and affection throughout cyberspace. In particular, she lent her public cyber-voice to the work of Breast Cancer Action, and to their project Think Before You Pink, as well as to METAvivor.org, a non-profit group which raises funds that go solely to research into metastatic breast cancer. Via Skype, email, Facebook, cellphone, and, I often think, sheer osmosis, Rachel personally exhorted me to keep digging into issues for which we shared a mutual passion — not only the Pink Peril, but the misleading hype of reportage about breast cancer research; the paucity of funding for research into mets; the real costs of having breast cancer, financial, physical, and psychosocial; the inequities inherent in the healthcare system; and so much more. It was she who suggested that I turn my snarky graphic from Grumblers for the Cure, into a badge that we grumblers could post on our blogs. On New Year’s Day of 2012, Rach published 2012, With No Apologies to 2011, in which she coined the term ‘bitchblogging,’ a term we mutually applied to ourselves with pride. It would turn out to be her second-last post. Fittingly, the last post she wrote was For The Cure, Or Not?. Metastatic breast cancer had dragged her to hell and back throughout the previous year, and yet, in characteristic style, she still managed — prophetically, it turned out — to skewer Komen’s immense hypocrisy, the depths of which we were all to discover in the days preceding her death, when Komen infamously withdrew funding to Planned Parenthood. One of the things that most pierces my heart is that, despite or maybe because of the horrific miseries of 2011, Rach had invited some of her sister bloggers to spend the weekend with her at her home in early March. I was delighted to be included. When she died, just a few short weeks before that weekend, my heart shattered with rage, impotence and speechless grief. The title of this description of her is taken from a song that she loved and laughed about, that 80’s anthem about the sheer bliss of life and love, ‘Walking on Sunshine,’ by Katrina and the Waves. The day before she died, I posted a video of the song on her Facebook page, used as the soundtrack for a splendid, remarkable dog-training video. She had just spent a dreadful week in the hospital, and last we’d heard, she’d made it out of ICU and seemed to have made a turnaround. The video was perfect — three of the things she loved — dogs, that song, and a day at the beach. I don’t know now if she ever got to see it. The next morning, we heard that she had died. Still, this line from the song is as true now as it was then: “I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that’s really real.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Today, one year after that wretched day in February, I know that I do not grieve alone. Today, my heart and thoughts are especially with Curt Niebur and his two little boys, and with Anthony Moro, Mandy Cheetham, and all of Rachel’s extended family.

211,26,48,[Timestamp('2012-09-30 00:00:00')],"Published at: 08:09 am - September 30, 2012 This is not what I was planning to do this morning. Yes, I was planning to write a post. But merely a thoughtful little post about emerging briefly from my blogosphere hiatus to say that this healing time I’ve taken has been very helpful, and that I plan to continue it by not writing any new, in-depth posts for a while longer, but by reposting a salient selection of my previous ones throughout the month of October. However… …then I saw this, on Facebook, posted by De-Fund the Komen Foundation. And I felt it was my duty to step up to the plate, so to speak. There are so many things about this that caught my eye, as it were, I can’t even begin to list them. But one of them is that this is the second annual occurrence of this event. Like the first one wasn’t bad enough. Like no one evidently jumped all over Susan G. Komen’s Las Vegas chapter and pointed out that this might be, shall we say, extraordinarily tacky. One wonders if the Las Vegas chapter includes any actual women who’ve actually experienced breast cancer. I suppose that, being Las Vegas, what with showgirls kicking in chorus lines in casinos and wearing skimpy outfits, they take perhaps a different view of sexploitation for profit. But really. For a breast cancer fundraiser?? Just when you think Komen couldn’t sink to a new low, they do. Last year’s poster was more thematically consistent, at least. The model still had no face, but she wore a bikini that was supposed to suggest a baseball uniform, and she was even holding a bat: I wonder why they changed the outfit this year. Maybe they thought the bat was too hostile. Or unfeminine. In any event, this one was posted by a friend in the comments under the first poster. She found it on a website called The Randy Report (hah hah — written by a man named Randy) which reported that at last year’s event, the Chippendales showed up. Well, of course! Their home is Las Vegas after all. I wonder if they wore pink jock straps. But you know, I thought that the Chippendales might serve a more apt purpose by helping fundraise for testicular cancer perhaps. Or maybe prostate cancer. Whatever. Something along the lines of the above event. Like, say, “Jockstraps for the Cure.” Or maybe they could launch a special campaign around the holidays: The only problem with the holiday theme is that the color of the official testicular cancer ribbon is not red, but orchid. I have no idea why. Maybe it was the only color left. But otherwise, I think this could totally work. I mean, fair is fair. If we’re going to sex up breast cancer, why not sex up all of them? I admit it might be difficult to do this for cancers that involve internal organs. But, heck, even something as unsexy as fundraising for colon cancer might get a boost out of having a “Thongs for the Cure” event. Or you could hold a fundraiser in a strip club, shake some booty, and call it “G-strings for the Cure.” Same difference, right? Okay, maybe not. I do think, though, that this year’s ‘Save Second Base’ poster could be improved upon. So, I decided to revise it, in an attempt to inject a note of accuracy to the whole breast cancer thing. So, what do you think? Think they’d let me design next year’s poster? I think I’ll post this on their Facebook wall and see if they like it.

213,26,5,[Timestamp('2016-02-13 00:00:00')],"Published at: 06:02 pm - February 13, 2016 Two years ago today, my friend Shelli, who blogged at the Dirty Pink Underbelly, died of metastatic breast cancer. Four days after her death, I started writing this post. And couldn’t quite finish it. It wasn’t any easier to finish it today than it was then. [February 17, 2014] This entire thing about making friends via social media is a little dangerous. Especially in the cancer club. What happens when you really bond with someone? What if they’re having a truly execrable day and you want to rush over and do something for them? Except that they live in Timbuktu, and you don’t, and the only chance you have of providing tangible help is if Doctor Who lands his TARDIS in your driveway and whisks you off. Or if Harry Potter drops in and teaches you how to disapparate. What if they have metastatic breast cancer? What if they have to go to the hospital — again? Sure, you can text and message and email till your fingers fall off. But all the texted hugs in the world feel inadequate in such a circumstance. And yet, bless them, they still tell you that it matters that you’re there, waaaay over there, far away in cyberspace, offering your understanding and affection in bits and bytes. Such was the nature of my friendship with Shelli. It started off, like many of my closest cyber-friendships have, with us stumbling upon each other, around September of 2012, as we were both girding our loins to endure yet another Pinktober. I believe we found each other’s blogs, then our blog Facebook pages, and then became friends on Facebook, all about the same time. She told me about her other Facebook page, Cancer Pissed Me Off Today. I told her about helping METAvivor launch their first blog. We conversed a lot via private message. Our first long conversation was about bone mets. It was a conversation that never really ended, as Shelli endured pain, hot spots, and pathological fractures, plus the radiation, chemo, pain meds, and vertebroplasties all aimed at controlling them. The other thing we talked about a lot was the Pink Peril and our frustration at its pernicious persistence. Last September, as we braced ourselves for our second Pinktober as friends, she said, “I get so frustrated every year when noobs don’t know, don’t get, and keep spouting the pink froth. It feels like swimming upstream. I even have gotten in arguments with others with mets who haven’t been de-pinked, and think that the way to raise awareness is to blend in and be the same as the pink. I feel like a meanie crankie bitch pants.” Eventually, we discovered that we shared an abiding cyberlove for Carolyn Frayn, who also had metastatic breast cancer. That led to some hilarious three-way communication, knee-deep in noir humor and creative cussing. Carolyn and I were particularly fond of one of Shelli’s posts, Any One of Us Could Go at Any Time, which utterly and humorously destroys the “anyone could get hit by a bus tomorrow” thing, which foolish people — okay, thoughtless jackasses — all too often utter to people with metastatic cancer. In the interest of full disclosure, let me just provide a little background. As of my last checkups, I do not have metastatic breast cancer. I was diagnosed with widespread, ER/PR+, apparently high-grade DCIS in 2008. I endured the full-freight slash/burn/poison routine, albeit the poison coming in the form of oral anti-estrogen drugs. I did not elect to have reconstruction. I did manage to find and exploit the humor of having a prosthesis that looks like a chicken cutlet. I feel incredibly lucky to have become friends with Shelli and Carolyn. And Rachel. And several other remarkable women who do have metastatic breast cancer. It was Rachel who first coined the phrase “fearless friends,” describing us early-stagers who ‘get it,’ who are informed about metastatic breast cancer, and who are just as appalled that its death toll continues, who have no illusions about its potential to strike anyone. Still, there is a part of me that is humbled and amazed that any of these women would ever want to have me as a friend. Sure, I’m a clinician, and one of my first clinical specialties as a physical therapist was oncology rehab. So, yes, I get it and I got it a long time ago. I like to think, therefore, that of necessity and desire, I’ve developed perhaps more empathy and compassion than the average person. But still, what do I know about living with an expiration date, as Carolyn once put it? So, I feel humbled and grateful that any of these women would regard me as a friend, and not just a casual friend, but someone they could confide in about all the shit they’ve had to endure. Carolyn used to tell me that she wondered why I would want her as a friend. She once told me that she and Shelli opined that I might be crazy for wanting to be friends with people who were likely to die, horribly, before I did. That stopped me in my tracks for a moment. But then, of course, I reminded her that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, and we both laughed. On February 14, 2014, I was schlepping through another crazy workday. I had to drive many more miles than usual to see some of my homecare patients. I tried to schedule them by location, so I could see the distant ones in the morning, and the closer ones in the afternoon. It wasn’t working out. I was a little frustrated, but not overly. That’s life in homecare, after all. I was more frustrated by worry. For weeks, I had been worried about Shelli, who had been in an Arizona nursing home rehab center for several weeks, after being hospitalized for treatment of more bone pain and pathological fractures. Since being transferred to rehab, mets had evidently spread to her meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. She had not been fully conscious for days. She was in horrible pain. It was hard to get accurate, current information about her condition or about what was being done for her. For several days, I had been furiously messaging and emailing a couple of mutual friends, one of whom was there in Arizona and visiting her as often as she could. The other was Carolyn. On Friday morning, I did not have time before I hit the road to check my emails or Facebook to find out how Shelli was. But I had this feeling. I tried to get online with my cellphone during short breaks between patients, but it seemed that everywhere I drove that day, I ended up in cellphone death valley. Finally, I texted Carolyn, and she texted me back: Shelli had died sometime the night before. Somehow I did manage to be moderately useful to the rest of my patients and to drive home safely. The second last conversation I had with Shelli started with her congratulating me for using a comical euphemism in a comment on her timeline about her progressing bone mets, a post which would be seen by certain members of her family who shunned expletives. This was in late October, 2013. She applauded me for managing to avoid saying ‘fuck,’ even though she knew that’s what I wanted to say, and which I did say in a private message, along with pledging to work on my “Expelliarmus Cancer” spell. She wrote back, “Expelliarmus Cancer! LOL! Capital idea! I giggled out loud! Thank you for your treasured support. Thank you for being cognizant of when present company would really make dropping the f-bomb uncomfortable.” Our final conversation occurred in the last days of December, 2013, when her bone pain was becoming unendurable, and the treatment wasn’t much better. “Not sure what I’m doing here,” she said, referring to her hospitalization, “other than that I couldn’t walk and kept winding up on the floor.” “Wish I were there to help you up. xoxo,” I typed back. “I wish you could fix everything. xoxo,” she said. “Me, too,” I said. Shelli [February 13, 2016] Yesterday, as it happens, I read a Facebook post written by another woman with metastatic breast cancer, disgusted after she was told by a breast surgeon that, “Well, I may step off a curb and get hit by a bus…” In my comment, I left the link to Shelli’s hit-by-a-bus post. As of this moment, her link was liked by seven other women. It doesn’t fix everything, but it helps. And I think Shelli would be pleased.

214,26,50,[Timestamp('2012-07-28 00:00:00')],"Published at: 05:07 pm - July 28, 2012 Tell you what, dear readers, the self-proclaimed Queen of Snark is tired of this breast cancer shit. As of last July 24th, it’s been four years since I heard the words, “I’m sorry, Kathi. Your biopsy is positive.” About a week ago, I started writing a philosophical, seeing-the-glass-half-full sort of post, in an attempt to ease gently into how I’m really feeling lately. I don’t know why I even bothered. I got up this morning, came to my senses, and said, “Screw the ‘gently’ crap.” There still is a glass-half-full part, sort of. Finally, after “only” four years, I am starting to feel sort of normal sometimes. So now, when I look around at the laundry, the dishes, the lawn I have to mow, the pile of bills I have to pay, the continuing ed I have to do mostly on my own time in order to keep my physical therapy license so I can keep my job and my health insurance so I can pay the bills and get my mammogram next month, I don’t feel instantly overwhelmed. Now, I’m beginning to feel that perhaps I am somewhat equal to the task of living what used to be my ordinary, daily life. What I’m not sure I feel equal to is keeping up my usual snark-for-the-cause. It’s not so much that I can’t cop the requisite attitude. It’s more that I can’t stomach the fact that it’s still needed. I’m not sure I can stand to read yet another misleading, hyped-up headline about a flawed research study. A recent example, Breast cancer metastasis to bone driven by stress, researchers report, was posted by a few friends on Facebook, with comments indicating that the headline itself was taken seriously enough to create more stress. Meanwhile, the report’s second paragraph revealed that the study was conducted not on actual women with mets, but on mice. Nor can I endure another press release about yet another cutesy, pinkocentric fundraiser or social media meme disguising itself as awareness. Nor am I interested in “catching up” with Nancy Brinker in Europe as she admits over the phone to Oncology Times the degree to which Komen still doesn’t get it. In fact, I found it a tad irksome that OT even wasted space to report on catching up with NB. Who gives a rodent’s derriere? Not I. I’m tired of hearing yet another woman report that her breast surgeon, her radiation oncologist and her medical oncologist all confess to being ‘mystified’ by her continuing fatigue. Doesn’t mystify me. What mystifies me is that any doctor involved with cancer patients could still be mystified by the long and late-term side effects of cancer’s current scorched-earth treatment protocols. They do still learn to read in med school, don’t they? And I’m really tired of people dying. The list just gets longer all the time. I’ll tell you the god’s-honest truth: I really haven’t been the same since Rachel died. I think part of my heart is just permanently shredded. Makes me want to revive the Victorian custom of wearing at least a black armband for at least a year. So I don’t have to explain myself again. ‘Course, that would mean we’d all be wearing black armbands all the time, wouldn’t it? And finally, I’m tired of repeating myself. I’ve been noticing for some time now how often the things I’ve been blogging about, since I started this blog on New Year’s Day, 2009, keep coming up again and again. I’m usually heartened when some articulate, righteous blogger or activist or journalist writes passionately about something I’ve written about myself. But then I think, hell, I’ve already said all this. Several times. Ad infinitum. Ad nauseam. I know it’s the nature of news media, in this age of instant online access, that the same stuff gets reported a gazillion times over, for good or ill, not always well, not always accurately or insightfully. And that perhaps readers of online media seem to be at risk of becoming unable to think for themselves, to perform some genuine research about a subject, or to absorb anything that requires more than thirty seconds’ worth of their attention. But I’m sick of that, too. And at the end of the day, has the breast cancer conversation really changed? Enough? When do we just ‘get it’ once and for all? So, here’s the thing. I’m taking a break. No idea how long a break it will be. But I’m going to just live my life for a while — you know, that life I used to have before cancer. That life that has, in very large part, been on hold for four years. In the meantime, my blog will still be here. And if you have a yen for a nice, astringent dose of amazonian snarkitude, here’s a page that lists all my posts categorized under Fighting the Pink Peril. Counting this one, there are thirty-nine of them. In fact, I’ve given the page its own tab at the top of the blog — ‘Pink Peril’ — for easy access. Because evidently, the fight’s not done. Yet. And to my fellow grumblers, my sisters in snark, my compatriot bitchbloggers and righteous ranters, carry on. I’m still with you in spirit. Always.

223,26,59,[Timestamp('2012-05-04 00:00:00')],"Published at: 03:05 pm - May 04, 2012 If You Don’t Have One, then Shut the Hell Up. If it weren’t for the website from whence I borrowed the above photo, I might have lost my mind entirely over the past few months. You’ve got to love a site called Government Free VJJ. The site tagline says it all: “Dear Men in Congress: If we knit you a uterus, will you stay out of ours?” Girl-lilla warfare at its finest. I encourage you to visit and enjoy a nice sardonic chuckle. Then grab some yarn. Well, let’s see…where to begin? In the last several weeks, we’ve seen countless news reports about American male legislators working their flabby, mostly-white butts off in an attempt to limit women’s access to healthcare. First there was the Congressional panel that conducted hearings on birth control, which included exactly zero members of the female persuasion. Then there was the attempt to defund women’s health services in Texas — the homebase, not coincidentally, of Klan Komen. Plus there were legislative attempts, in more states than I can keep up with, to limit or discourage access by granting ‘personhood’ to our ova, and forcing vaginal ultrasounds on women seeking legal abortions in Virginia, Idaho, Pennsylvania and Florida, to name a mere few. Oh, and the Republican Presidential Candidate-Apparent, the Mittster, apparently wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and get rid of Planned Parenthood. If you can stand any more info, there’s a cogent reading list on Government Free VJJ’s website. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg recently purchased Instagram, from which a bunch of French dudes spawned Boobstagram. Their tagline: “Montrer ses seins sur le web c’est bien, les montrer à son médecin c’est mieux.” En anglais: “Showing your boobs on the web is good, showing them to your doctor is better.” All this is supposed to encourage young women in particular to be ‘aware’ of their breasts and ‘prevent’ breast cancer. In the translated words of les gars de Boobstagram, “Glamorous, audacious, original, whatever the means, as long as the objective is fulfilled: To stay alive.” Très noble, dudes. But, je suis désolée to tell you that we don’t actually have any tools as yet to prevent breast cancer. D’accord, c’est domage, but, hey, c’est la vie, n’est-ce pas? Also, while I was unable to find any concrete statistics on this, a somewhat cursory search of the web’s response to these countless images of young female cleavage suggested that it has mostly provided another source of tit-illation pour les dudes. If you think I’m biased in that assessment, Casey Chan of Gizmodo wrote a brief piece about it, headlined, Boobstagram Is How You Will Spend the Rest of Your Day. In it, Chan, remarking on why Zuckerberg purchased Instagram, says that Boobstagram “might be the reason why Zuck splurged a fresh billi on it. It might be the reason why Instagram exists. It might be the reason why we exist.” There is no mention in the piece, nor in the comments following it, of breast cancer. Nuff said. I briefly considered uploading this image on Boobstagram, but I was too busy reorganizing my sock drawer. Porn for the Cure If mere tit-illation isn’t enough for you, how about pornography? Okay, well, not exactly, but another recent news item, from the “You can’t make this stuff up” category, reported that last April 24th, online-streaming porn site Pornhub.com [and no, I’m not providing a link] teamed up with “award-winning porn star,” Bree Olson, to provide free breast exams in a bus in downtown New York. Yeah, really. I shudder to contemplate what sorts of awards they dish out to porn stars. And why. It’s not quite as bad as it sounds. They did have “a team of medical professionals” to carry out these exams, including Dr. David Shafer, a diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery, reportedly voted a “TOP DOC for Botox, Liposuction, Tummy Tuck, and Facelift,” who “was on board to lecture customers on how to conduct examinations of their own and offered his own screening services free of charge.” What a guy. Wonder if Olson is one of his patients. Olson herself told Fox News that she was motivated to do this because the mother of a close friend died in her thirties of breast cancer. Explaining Pornhub’s rationale for the bus, Olson remarked, “They figured, you know, breasts are a large part [no pun intended, I’m sure] of our industry, and the two would kind of coincide.” Heart-warming, isn’t it? One site which reported on this story, called Peeperz — trust me, do not visit — also included a video of a lifelike-down-to-the-tanlines, animated 3D woman-droid performing a breast self-exam. Nice that they’re so public-spirited. And you only need one hand to click ‘Play.’ Meanwhile, Back in the Un-Sexy Land of Cancer… Aside from the blatantly obvious, one of the things that aggravates me about this boob dross is that, once again, it pushes the prevention myth. Last time I checked, which was earlier this morning, we don’t have anything yet that works to prevent breast cancer. Yes, there is research underway on vaccines. There’s a recent report here, but you have to copy & paste the link to get it to work: http://news.health.com/2012/04/02/early-study-hints-that-breast-cancer-vaccine-might-work. Other studies are identifying biomarkers that may signal future breast cancer risk and lead to prevention, but it will be years before any of these projects yields something usable. Another thing that bugs me is that this kind of thing may add more confusion over the whole breast-self-exam issue. There have been many studies published over the last several years suggesting that formal BSE’s don’t work any better than informal ones, nor do they reduce breast cancer mortality. But conclusive assertions are complicated by study limitations, the differences between self-exams and clinical breast exams performed by physicians, and exams performed in conjunction with or without mammograms and MRIs. Not to mention the age of the woman performing the exam, her breast tissue density, and a host of other perplexing items. Perhaps the most coherent write-up I found on the subject this morning is this post written in 2008 by Dr. Susan Love, the week after the Cochrane Collaboration released an analysis of the research that had been done to date. Her post is called Breast Self-Exam: What The Research Tells Us. More recent studies are ongoing, but inconclusive. The bottom line still seems to be that we should be checking our breasts periodically for anomalies, but that we don’t have to do it formally. And if we’re not sure what we’ve found, we should see a doctor. And in the meantime, last October, GE obtained FDA approval for new technology that provides contrast-enhanced spectral mammography. Like other contrast imaging, it requires the IV injection of a contrast substance, but evidently, unlike CT scans and MRIs, fewer images are needed, are done more quickly, are analyzed immediately, and will ultimately be less costly than CT or MRI imaging. Efficacy studies have demonstrated improved clarity, especially in dense breast tissue, over conventional mammography, but it was difficult to find clear information about longitudinal comparisons. CESM has recently been launched at the Pink Lotus Breast Health Center in Beverly Hills. In this video, Dr. Kristi Funk explains that this technology could eliminate the need for follow-up breast MRIs after a suspicious diagnostic mammogram, but does not suggest that it will replace screening mammography. She recommends it for high-risk women, those who are BRCA positive or have dense breast tissue. Because it can be done immediately after a diagnostic mamm, in about ten to fifteen minutes, and significantly enhances any cancer lesions in the tissue, waiting times for results are reduced and a plan for treatment can be worked on right away. Another imaging technology being developed is called photo-acoustic tomography, which can see cancer cells long before a discrete tumor forms, and requires no radiation at all. For now, we can all hope that these kinds of tools will become more widely available. And genuine prevention would be nice, too. We can also hope that someday, prurience peddlers and pink-washers will not keep encouraging everyone to mistake boob awareness for cancer awareness, and that sanctimonious legislators will get over this slut obsession, admit that it takes two to have sexual intercourse, and put a Trojan on their power trips. So far, misogyny has not been proven to prevent pregnancy, poverty or cancer. I’m going to flush my browser history now. With sulphuric acid.

224,26,6,[Timestamp('2016-01-30 00:00:00')],"Published at: 10:01 pm - January 30, 2016 New Horizons Many of you know that I’ve started writing articles now and then for Healthline. It was flattering to be asked to write for them, and it’s even nicer that my editor liked my suggestion that I write as a physical therapist who has been a breast cancer patient, who often treats cancer patients, and can thus offer clinical advice. It’s been interesting, to say the least, to be on this side of the editing process, after years of editing myself and others. Now I have to comply with a lengthy list of submission guidelines and rules about what kind of references and links I’m allowed to use. Years ago, I helped edit a magazine, so I know what it’s like to deal with writers who submit appalling copy and are not receptive to editorial suggestions. With all that in mind, I’ve tried and generally succeeded in sending my editor decent copy, and so far, he’s been appreciative, and his edits have been few and apt. Back in November of 2015, I submitted a lengthy piece about arm and shoulder pain with breast cancer. It included a section with exercise advice and descriptions. My editor suggested breaking it into two articles, one with the clinical explanation of why we develop arm and shoulder pain during and after treatment, and the other with the exercises themselves. I agreed. We both thought it would be helpful to include pictures or illustrations. Since we couldn’t use pictures from someone else’s website because of copyright restrictions, he said he would see if Healthline could arrange for some. Whoops Meanwhile, the clinical article was published, while work continued on the exercise article. A few weeks later, my editor emailed me some exercise photos that were taken by one of Healthline’s freelance photographers. As photos go, they were okay. The photographer and the model both got the poses right from my descriptions. But they were wrong for my article. They showed a perky young woman of about 20, glowing with health, dressed in a tight pink spandex camisole, her long hair perfectly coifed. She was photographed in a glitzy health club, against a backdrop of barbells and weight-training equipment. I was flabbergasted. It took me a day or two to get my shock under control, and write, with some trepidation, what I hoped was a diplomatic email to my editor, pointing out that he might want to rethink them. My exercises, I told him, were aimed at people, mostly women, who had just had breast surgery, who might have lymphedema as well, who were mostly not 20 years old, who were sick and possibly facing chemotherapy and radiation, and who needed some gentle exercises they could do at home. I didn’t hear back from him, which felt a little ominous, and then the holiday season arrived, and I had other things to think about. Stick Figures After the first of the year, I finally got an email from my editor suggesting a few new topics for articles. My unpublished exercise article, however, was not mentioned. I realized I couldn’t start another article until the exercise piece was resolved one way or another. As a physical therapist, I’ve handed out hundreds, possibly thousands, of home exercise programs in my career. If you’ve ever had rehab, you’ve probably received them. You know what they’re usually like. Sometimes, I scribble verbal descriptions only. Often, I throw in a few stick figures. Sometimes, I have time to print out pre-made programs with illustrations showing age-neutral, nondescript people. In the past decade or so, software and websites for rehab therapists have endeavored to include illustrations showing people of all ages and genders, so that we can target our handouts more closely to the patients who will be following them. Theraband Scapular Exercise Since Healthline needed illustrations they could own, I sat myself down, opened Illustrator, and decided to draw them some. I drew one that went with one of the exercises in my still-unpublished article. Then I emailed my editor, attached the drawing, asked if we might try to get the thing online at last, and offered to do the drawings myself. He wrote back to say that he couldn’t assign any more freelance art projects right now, but he might be able to contract me for illustrations in a few months. He agreed with me that he was disappointed that the photographs didn’t conform to his suggestions about setting and attire. Meanwhile, he looked forward to a draft for my next article. He didn’t say anything about when or if the exercise article would get posted. Two mornings later, I checked Facebook before leaving for work, and lo and behold, my friend Nancy, of Nancy’s Point, had posted a link to Healthline for my exercise article. They had decided to publish my explanation and descriptions, sans pictures. At last! Whew On the whole, this freelance writing gig continues to be full of mostly pleasant surprises, although I will admit that I am often a bit mystified about how and when decisions get made. But I’m grateful to my editor, and to Healthline, for going the distance with me on this. They say that every picture is worth a thousand words. But sometimes, words alone are all you need. And at least I managed to spare us all from being excruciatingly represented by a happy, pink-clad model who looked like she’d probably never suffered anything worse than a hangnail. Although I probably shouldn’t make assumptions, because too many of us have had some fool tell us, “But you don’t look sick!” You never know. In any case, in the future, you may see this drawing on the left, or perhaps other illustrations drawn by yours truly, accompanying another article. Or not. Seems appropriate that the first one I drew was a shrug.

228,26,63,[Timestamp('2012-04-10 00:00:00')],"Published at: 12:04 pm - April 10, 2012 Having Birthdays Today is the fourth birthday I’ve had since being diagnosed with cancer. So far, I’m still dancing with NED (which means my cancer tests since treatment still keep saying “No Evidence of Disease”). Around my first birthday after cancer, I went out and got a tattoo. On my leg. Not pink. Not a ribbon. Yeah, it’s the one on my leg in the blog logo pic. It wasn’t my first tattoo. It followed these little black dot tattoos that I got — involuntarily — when I had radiation. I went for my leg tattoo with another breast cancer sistah. The tattoo artist turned out to have lost his sister to breast cancer a few years before. Instant support group. Stuff like that happens in Cancer Land. If I had any advantage going into Cancer Land, it was perhaps that I’d already been through menopause, so I wasn’t suddenly thrust into it by cancer treatment for my hormone-positive cancer. So, I had already ‘adjusted’ to hot flashes and night sweats and having a thermostat that was permanently stuck on high. I shelved all my turtlenecks and saved a lot on heating oil. Didn’t mean I had no hormones left, however. I came to value my remaining meager supply when I was put on tamoxifen, which proceeded to annihilate what remained of them. After a year of suffering through headaches, joint pain, hair like straw, brain fog and endless fatigue, I decided that I wanted to hang onto my remaining dribble of hormones. The 7.5% decrease in my recurrence risk that was supposed to be conferred on me by tamoxifen just wasn’t worth the suffering in the meantime. When you’re over 50, you’ve already bumped into a few challenges to your quality of life, even without cancer. So you get pretty snarky about hanging onto what you’ve got left. Age and language and stereotypes are funny things. Dr. Susan Love once publicly referred to certain kinds of breast cancer as ‘granny cancer.’ I’m not entirely sure what she meant by that. Since the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommended that routine mammography for breast cancer screening should start at age 50, there may be too many folks who think of breast cancer as ‘granny cancer.’ Tell that to my friend Rachel’s husband, who just lost his wife at age 41 to metastatic breast cancer. Personally, I don’t like anyone referring to any kind of cancer with glib, age-ist phrases. The birthdays stopped for Rachel, and they continue to stop for 40,000 American women and men every year because of breast cancer. So, I’m just happy to have another birthday. It’s a bit sobering now to be within two years of my sixtieth birthday, but we baby boomers, especially we of the younger contingent born after 1950, seem to be benefitting from a whole rethink on age expectations. I’ve been old enough to be someone’s granny for over a decade. Or two. But I and my life bear little resemblance to my own grandmother’s life. Thanks to increased longevity, better nutrition, more exercise, sunscreen, and really good hair coloring, we women of a certain age have a much different life than our predecessors. So I’ve been a little (a lot) ticked off that cancer has seen fit to interrupt and rearrange my own expectations in this decade. In fact, the word ‘expectation’ has changed irrevocably for me in the past few years. I expected to slow down a bit as I got older. I didn’t expect to get my sorry butt handed to me on a platter by post-treatment fatigue. I expected to plan how many more years I had to work until I could afford to retire. I didn’t expect to become leary of making plans at all. Heck, I expected to be symmetrical, more or less. Now I’m not. Whatever. Old news. I’m getting over it. One day at a time. I do expect to be here today and tomorrow. I could be wrong about tomorrow. You never know. I do expect that I will continue to love dark chocolate, and daffodils, and temperate weather, and my friends, and laughter, and cats and dogs, and writing, and making pictures. I’m not sure I ever expected my snarkitude quotient to multiply as much as it has in the past three-and-a-half years. But since it has, I expect it to continue. And I’m planning to enjoy all of this and more today. And every other day I keep dancing with NED. So, how’s the whole birthday thing for you now?

232,26,67,[Timestamp('2012-03-10 00:00:00')],"Published at: 11:03 pm - March 10, 2012 It’s one of my cherished days off from work. I’ve been trying to be kind to myself today. I’ve had a hard time sleeping lately, so for the past few days, I’ve once again resorted to taking a Benadryl (which is, as it happens, a pink pill) at bedtime, because it works better than Ambien, melatonin, warm milk, reading, or any of my other tricks when my restlessness is beyond them all. Thus, I woke up today, having had a splendid night’s sleep — the kind enhanced by knowing you don’t have to get up for work the next day — following on three nights of decent sleep, ready to get through an uncomplicated To-Do list. And yet, despite all that, as soon as I was vertical, I felt like I could collapse. The invisible, unpredictable, incomprehensible stone wall of fatigue hit me again, as it has so often since I was diagnosed. But because I’d slept well, I remembered for a change that I do still have Provigil, which temporarily but effectively shoves back the fatigue. So I took one. And it worked. Insomnia and fatigue have been my companions almost nonstop for the past month. I managed to tame them today, but I am still slogging through the chill, relentless fog of grief, which has exacerbated them, which has been following me like a spectre since February 6th, the day Rachel died. I don’t have any medication for grief. And if I did, I don’t think I’d take it. I don’t want to disguise it or tame it or drown it with chemicals. No. It issues from my heart. It deserves my attentiveness. I was supposed to be in New Jersey today, this weekend. I was supposed to be at Rachel’s house, with a handful of other blog sisters, laughing, snarking, eating pie, meeting some of these women in person for the first time, because that’s what Rachel had wanted, planned, arranged for. Because I was delighted by the prospect of seeing her again, in real life, after so many months. Of getting to meet Newman, her dog, in person, and giving him a good ol’ ear rub and backscratch. Of mercilessly deconstructing Komen, all things Putrid Pink, and the breast cancer culture in general. Of teaching those in attendence to sing my song parody “Sherpa Girls,” written in appreciation of all my blog sisters, in four-part harmony, maybe a little off-key, but no doubt enthusiastically, perhaps with a little cowbell accompaniment. * * Sherpa Girls – Audio Link “Feisty Sherpas, snarky ones! You make blogging so much fun. Oh, I love you truly, Sherpa Girls…” Sherpa Girls, 5/14/11, lyrics Instead, I’m at home, stymied by loss, regret, the cruelty of timing. Instead, like Nancy described in her post today, I feel ‘sad, angry and cheated.’ Instead, I drove to New Jersey not today, like I was supposed to, but a month ago, to speak at Rachel’s Memorial Service. It was raining that softly, mistily, like tears barely held in check. On my way down, I cursed cancer for all the times I’d wanted to jump in the car and drive down to see her again before this, but didn’t, couldn’t. Because Rach was in the hospital yet again — dealing with collapsed lungs, pain, infections, having chemo again, dealing with all the miserable vagaries of mets, suffering the side effects of trying to beat them back and buy more time. Precious, precious time. Time when she might finally have a decent few days when she could have fun during a visit, feel more like a person than a dishrag, feel more like my friend and comrade than one of my homecare patients. So many potential road trips put off because of cancer, stolen because of cancer. I cursed when I got to the first tollbooth on the highway, preparing to fish out my small bills and loose change. Then I realized that the transponder I had in my car — installed to get me over the toll bridges here in Rhode Island — worked all the way through New York and New Jersey. So, I cursed again as I sailed through the toll booths, angry at how easy it made the drive, how easy it would have made all those other drives I never got to take. The thought of this weekend sat like lead in my heart all through Rachel’s service. When I got up to speak, I referred to it. When I referred to it, the loss of it, cancer’s theft of it, rose up, bitterly, mercilessly, in my throat. “We thought we had time,” I choked out. “We all thought we had more time.” “And we were wrong.” What is left to say? Perhaps nothing. Except that we have to stop this. A few weeks ago, another cyber sister sent me a message saying that she’d found a lump in her breast. She didn’t have insurance. She’d been turned away by the local program that was supposed to provide free screening and diagnostics for breast cancer, because, she was told, it might not be cancer, most lumps aren’t cancer, it might be nothing, she wasn’t ‘sick’ enough yet. She scrambled to arrange a diagnostic mammogram and biopsy at her own expense. A week later, she was told her biopsy was positive. I’m so tired of this. It’s hard not to feel deflated, defeated, beaten. When I looked back over my blog archives, I realized how many times I’ve had to say the same things over and over again, how many times I’ve railed about the same themes, the same inadequacies in our healthcare system, in our research priorities, in the pinkwashed breast cancer culture. When is this all going to change? When is breast cancer going to end? When is it going to stop stealing my sleep, my energy, my peace, my friends? I don’t know. But I do know that we cannot stop. We here in the blogosphere, in the advocacy and activist communities, on the ground, in cyberspace, wherever we are, we cannot stop. We have to keep speaking, shouting, louder, longer. For Rachel. For all of us. Rachel Cheetham Moro from Sarah Horton on Vimeo. Thank you, Sarah & Gayle, for your friendship and for this video.

237,26,71,[Timestamp('2012-02-10 00:00:00')],"Published at: 04:02 pm - February 10, 2012 Susan, front-left, wearing glasses; Rachel, back row, third from right; NBCC 2011 It was through their words, written on their blogs, that many of us first came to know Rachel Cheetham Moro and Susan Neibur. A lucky few of us got to meet them, along with the other bloggers in the august, feisty group pictured above, at the National Breast Cancer Coalition Conference in April, 2011. It was a rare treat to put a face, a smile, a whole person — “Oh, my god!” we said, laughing, “you’re real!!” — with the women we had come to know in cyberspace. It seems impossible that we lost them both this week, on February 6, 2012, a day now etched into our hearts. I, who write almost every day in some fashion, usually with a fair amount of ease, have struggled all week with a heavy silence in my soul, a speechless inner keening, any words I might choose drowned in tears and heartache and shock. Yet we all knew, we all feared, that such a day would come. They were both young, both in their thirties when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. And within a handful of years, their cancer turned metastatic. Yet they continued to write, to speak their truth, to awaken us to a reality that too often seems lost amidst a sea of pink. If there is any comfort to be had in this catastrophe, this tragic loss, it is that their words have made a difference, and will continue to do so. Of the many posts, tributes, and articles so far written about them, I wanted to share these two, each written for online news sites, each testifying to the power and reach of the words our two sisters have left behind. The first is a call to action, to demand better from an organization that purports to be keeping its promise to another young woman, diagnosed in her thirties, robbed of life by metastatic breast cancer. Fittingly, the article, published two days after her death, quotes Rachel: The real scandal: science denialism at Susan G. Komen for the Cure. The second, published on a Washington Post blog, honors Susan: Susan Niebur, the Toddler Planet hero, friend and mother. All week, I’ve been turning to the words of other wise women who have written, who knew the power of words. And I found this, an excerpt from a poem by Adrienne Rich, from her collection The Dream of a Common Language, that articulates the power of telling our stories: –from Transcendental Etude No one ever told us we had to study our lives, make of our lives a study, as if learning natural history or music, that we should begin with the simple exercises first and slowly go on trying the hard ones, practicing till strength and accuracy became one with the daring to leap in transcendence, take the chance of breaking down in the wild arpeggio or faulting the full sentence of the fugue. –And in fact we can’t live like that: we take on everything at once before we’ve even begun to read or mark time, we’re forced to begin in the midst of the hardest movement, the one already sounding as we are born. At most we’re allowed a few months of simply listening to the simple line of a women’s voice singing a child against her heart. Everything else is too soon, too sudden, the wrenching-apart, that woman’s heartbeat heard ever after from a distance, the loss of that ground-note echoing whenever we are happy, or in despair. Everything else seems beyond us, we aren’t ready for it, nothing that was said is true for us, caught naked in the argument, the counterpoint, trying to sightread what our fingers can’t keep up with, learn by heart what we can’t even read. And yet it is this we were born to. We aren’t virtuosi or child prodigies, there are no prodigies in this realm, only a half-blind, stubborn cleaving to the timbre, the tones of what we are — even when all the texts describe it differently. And we’re not performers, like Liszt, competing against the world for speed and brilliance […] The longer I live the more I mistrust theatricality, the false glamour cast by performance, the more I know its poverty beside the truths we are salvaging from the splitting-open of our lives. The woman who sits watching, listening, eyes moving in the darkness is rehearsing in her body, hearing-out in her blood a score touched off in her perhaps by some words, a few chords, from the stage: a tale only she can tell. […] Vision begins to happen in such a life as if a woman quietly walked away from the argument and jargon in a room and sitting down in the kitchen, began turning in her lap bits of yarn, calico and velvet scraps, laying them out absently on the scrubbed boards in the lamplight, with small rainbow-colored shells sent in cotton-wool from somewhere far away, and skeins of milkweed from the nearest meadow– original domestic silk, the finest findings– and the darkblue petal of the petunia, and the dry darkbrown lace of seaweed; not forgotten either, the shed silver whisker of the cat, the spiral of paper-wasp-nest curling beside the finch’s yellow feather. Such a composition has nothing to do with eternity, the striving for greatness, brilliance — only with the musing of a mind one with her body, experienced fingers quietly pushing dark against bright, silk against roughness, pulling the tenets of a life together with no mere will to mastery, only care for the many-lived, unending forms in which she finds herself, becoming now the sherd of broken glass slicing light in a corner, dangerous to flesh, now the plentiful, soft leaf that, wrapped round the throbbing finger, soothes the wound; and now the stone foundation, rockshelf further forming underneath everything that grows. —————————————— For Rachel, for Susan, we must all keep writing their stories and ours.

238,26,72,[Timestamp('2012-02-04 00:00:00')],"Published at: 02:02 pm - February 04, 2012 [Reposted on October 13, 2012, for Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day. One day. That’s all MBC gets out of this entire pink circus known as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Pitiful.] February 6, 2012: This morning, I found out that my dear, darling friend, snark and ‘bitchblogger’ sister, Rachel Cheetham Moro, died of breast cancer. Many of us first got to know her through her blog Cancer Culture Chronicles. Then, in April of 2011, I had the great joy of meeting her, along with several other of our blog sisters, in person, at the NBCC Conference in Washington, D.C. We got a chance to be ‘real,’ to laugh, to scheme, to tell our collective truth about this miserable disease together. We were friends now in real life as well as in virtual life. It was a friendship that deepened immeasurably over the last year. Just before I wrote this on 2/4, Rach had been in the hospital for a week, in ICU, mostly unconscious, in pain and having seizures from what would turn out to be brain mets. By the time I started it, her family & friends were all waiting to hear for sure the results of tests, but she was conscious again and about to be moved to a regular room. In anxiety and helplessness and outrage and loving concern for her Saturday morning, I wrote this post. You may visit her blog to leave messages at this link: Rachel Cheetham Moro 1970-2012. We will never forget you, Rach. Never. I wasn’t going to write a post today. Yeah, it’s World Cancer Day. Yeah, we all heard yesterday that Komen retracted its decision to defund Planned Parenthood. And yeah, the long-awaited documentary film, Pink Ribbons, Inc., about the rampant pink-washing of breast cancer, is going to be distributed in the U.S. It’s a remarkable confluence of events. So it’s certainly not like there’s nothing to blog about. But I’m tired of cancer. And today, I’m particularly distraught about cancer, because a young woman who is very dear to me is in the hospital. Again. Because of breast cancer. And her friends and family are all waiting to hear whether her mets have spread. And I think about this remarkable confluence of events, and Komen, and pink-washing, and why we even have to have a World Cancer Day, and it sickens me. Because my friend was diagnosed in her thirties. Because another friend, who was also diagnosed with breast cancer in her thirties, was turned down by Komen for a small grant to help women get screening mammograms before they’re forty. Because Komen told her that “Susan G. Komen for the Cure’s current screening guidelines are not in line with what your organization promotes,” because their guidelines recommend screening mammograms starting at age forty. Because Susan G. Komen herself was diagnosed with and died of breast cancer in her thirties. Because when another young woman I know tried to get financial assistance from Komen to help her with her breast cancer, Komen failed to help. Because Komen still pushes mammograms as the be-all-and-end-all of ‘prevention,’ when most of us know they have serious limitations, that they don’t even find breast cancer sometimes, especially in young women and women with dense breast tissue. You know. Women like Susan G. Komen. Because Nancy Brinker happens to be one of the most publicly ill-informed breast cancer spokespersons on the planet. Because Komen has not made metastatic breast cancer, the kind that killed Susan G. Komen, a priority. Because, in fact, Komen spends only 19% of their considerable budget to find that much-vaunted cure they’re supposed to be all about. Because only 2% of all cancer research dollars are spent directly on metastatic cancer. Because only one day in Pinktober is set aside for awareness of metastatic breast cancer. Because I’m utterly disgusted at this hypocrisy. And I’ve got news for all the folks who finally saw the light about Komen and decided in the last few days to stop supporting them: Komen didn’t deserve your support in the first place, and they haven’t deserved it for a long time now. So, maybe we should actually be grateful that Komen let its pink, plastic, carcinogenic, over-merchandised mask slip this week and showed their true face. Because it woke a lot of people up, to the insidious speciousness of politics, to the callousness of charities that seem to care more about corporate sponsorship than they do about corporate integrity, to the large holes in our so-called social safety net. And I am truly glad for that awakening. But guess what? As Jody Schoger said in her post yesterday, “…what has changed for women at risk for cancer? Nothing. Poverty is still a carcinogen. Women who are poor are still poor. Their cancers are still detected at later stages when the disease is much more difficult to treat.” This mess, this perversion of breast cancer awareness, didn’t just happen this week. It’s been going on for decades. And I’m sick of it. Because it needs to change, before more of us die, before we all drown in pink ribbons instead of saving ourselves with genuine enlightenment and solutions. Because it’s just the tip of the pink iceberg. A link from the Centers for Disease Control about their Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program for underserved women. Not the whole answer, but one of them.

239,26,73,[Timestamp('2012-02-02 00:00:00')],"Published at: 10:02 pm - February 02, 2012 Well, I’d wager you’d probably have to be in some sort of total news blackout to have escaped the media storm kicked up in the last day or so over Susan G. Komen’s decision to withdraw funding for mammograms from Planned Parenthood. We all know it’s because PP has the nerve to spend 3% of its budget providing abortions, while it spend the rest of its funds on trivial stuff like cancer screenings, along with a full range of health services to poor and underinsured women. As far as Komen is concerned, PP might as well have a big, scarlet “A” on its forehead. There’s not much I could say right now that hasn’t been said already by legions of journalists, bloggers, Facebookers and Tweeters. I thought about putting together a post filled with links to the post-announcement fallout trajectory, in chronological order, with a few snarky comments thereon. Phrases like ‘Nancy Brinker: holier-than-thou,’ ‘Harlots for Hooters,’ and ‘Coathangers for the Cure’ have drifted through my twisted brain. But I decided to draw and play with Photoshop instead. I must admit, I feel a kind of devilish glee at having so much raw material to work with — sort of the way Stephen Colbert must feel about the Republican Presidental primaries. A little visual snark is just so much fun. I do apologize to all the nuns out there for this first picture. Most of the nuns I know personally are a lot hipper than Nancy, and dress better, too. As a crusty, middle-aged feminista, who was around when we were first trying to get abortions out of the back-alley-and-coathanger-death days, I’ve been thinking that perhaps Komen should forget the pink ribbons, and start handing out pink coathangers instead. With that in mind, this next picture — especially if you’re a Harry Potter fan — signifies Komen’s new promotional image: Then again, maybe Komen should just admit it knows nothing whatsoever about public relations. At the rate it’s bleeding disillusioned donors, advisors, and public good will, it seems to be choking on its own high-handed sanctimony. At any rate, this is my advice: Well, I enjoyed myself. Hope you did, too. Snark on, Grumblers! A few image credits: The original photo of the nun’s habit came from Gina’s Costume Rentals. The picture of the Mirror of Erised came from The Noble Collection.

243,26,77,[Timestamp('2012-01-10 00:00:00')],"Published at: 12:01 pm - January 10, 2012 Just when I was beginning to wonder if I was perhaps not a very nice person after all, that I was maybe the only blogger out there who was not feeling particularly sanguine, philosophical, grateful, brave, accepting, noble, etcetera and so forth, about facing 2012 with some sort of valiant resolve to be a better person, achieve world peace, and — why not? — maybe help cure cancer, some of my cyber sisters reassured me by proxy. First, there was this post by Katie on Uneasy Pink that got me thinking about what motivates us to blog. She has noted a shift in her perspective over the past several months, and wonders where it’s brought her. While her commitment to the meaningful issues she has so ably identified has not wavered, she has realized the wisdom of picking her battles, that going head-to-head with some of the most egregious examples of foolishness out there in the land of breast cancer non-awareness “is a tremendous drain of energy. […] that if I take on a fight, the fight becomes the central issue. While I feel it’s important to stand up to these people and places, I worry that I run the risk of creating just another distraction from the truth about breast cancer.” I think I’ve been wrestling for a while now with a bit of outrage-fatigue myself. Not that I haven’t been up to the ol’ snark, high dudgeon and righteous indignation since, but a steady diet is wearying. And it doesn’t pay the mortgage. Meanwhile, I’m still slogging my way through this vast archeological dig known as “trying to get my life back.” Howard Carter had an easier time uncovering King Tut’s tomb. Several of my blog sisters have written posts about coming up with three words to help guide them through 2012, inspired by Philippa at Feisty Blue Gecko. And they’ve been wonderful words — like “resilience, escapade and wonder,” the words Philippa chose for this year; or “create, nurture and appreciate,” the words chosen by Jackie at Dispatch from Second Base. Over on Twitter, one of the weekly Breast Cancer Social Media tweetchats (#bcsm), hosted by Jody of Women With Cancer, was devoted to picking three words for 2012 and was a rousing success. In an attempt not to be a New Year’s grinch, I tried to come up with three words myself, but somehow, my heart just wasn’t in it. Not that I didn’t come up with some words. But the ones I kept coming up with all started with the prefix “re-” — an endless stream of words like renew, restore, reclaim, rediscover, repair. Not that there’s anything wrong with any of them. But I began to wonder about that prefix, the “again” of it. There was a message in that “again” that bothered me. It suggested that I was trying to go back, trying to find that person I used to be before breast cancer. And that person is gone. And I haven’t recovered (another “re-” word) from that loss. And maybe I never will. Huge, life-changing losses are like that. They may hurt less over time, but they never really go away. Instead, they reside in us, seem to become part of our DNA. In my stream of consciousness, I thought of a “re-” word in another language — the word ‘rechercher’, which means to search or retrieve — literally re-chercher, to look again. It occupies a famous phrase, which is the title of Marcel Proust’s magnum opus, À la Recherche du Temps Perdu. For years, the accepted title in English was “Remembrance of Things Past.” But that translation did not at all capture the feeling that prompted me to think of the word. It was the literal translation of the title that expressed it more closely — “in search of lost time.” And I discovered that, in fact, that translation has now become the accepted English version of Proust’s title. And that’s what all those vaguely disturbing “re-” words were saying, that I was once again, as I’ve done almost non-stop since being diagnosed, searching for lost time, my lost time — time, identity, energy, accomplishment, morphology, all lost to cancer. And I know that such a search is inevitably a waste of time. In mid-December, I did manage to conjure a little Photoshop distraction, inspired by a YouTube video that my friend Rachel found. It was a video about a fundraising partnership between the National Breast Cancer Foundation and Instinct Archery, the latter of which was selling ‘Hope’ pink-ribbon recurve bows to raise money for NBCF. The video started off with a row of male hunters, hanging out in the woods in their requisite plaid shirts, shooting arrows at several deer, followed by a pitch for these pink bows. Killing Deer for the Cure?? I wanted to embed this astoundingly ironic video in this post. But sometime in the few weeks since Rach, myself and several other bloggers lampooned it on Facebook, including a version of the Photoshopped image above that I posted on my blog’s FB page, I discovered that the video is now marked “Private.” Now, even the above link for these bows no longer includes any mention of NBCF. Apparently, we may have unwittingly pulled off another successful campaign of guerilla snark! Well, that was cheering, but I was still stumbling over my temps perdu, wondering what the heck to do or say about it all. And once again, my cyber-sisters came to the rescue, starting with singleshot1 and her gloves-off post, Chuckles, the cancer clown, about what we mask with our glib one-liners and snark-du-jour. Then came Rach, and her post, 2012, With No Apologies to 2011. Another marvel of tart truth-telling, she summarizes the reality of living with metastatic breast cancer last year, and the impact it may have on this one. Her three words: “I’m still here.” Her strategem: bitchblogging. And then, I noticed some good ol’ astringent and righteous ranting on the FB profiles of a few of my ol’ breast cancer forum buddies, these wise and wise-cracking wenches who got me though many a midnight while I was enduring treatment, as we plotted revenge against those numberless numbnuts-who-are-mean-to-cancer-patients, by forming a band of bald, burnt, lopsided, estrogen-deprived breast cancer harpies, armed with pitchforks and power tools to even up the score. And at last, I began to feel a wave of relief well up inside. I’m not a freak! Goddess-bless-me, I’m not alone! And then I thought, if I really followed my inclinations, I’d choose three expletives as my words for the year. I can come up with several more than three of those to describe how I feel about 2011. As far as 2012 goes, I’ve observed thus far that cancer is still attacking my friends, still attacking their friends and family members, still running roughshod over our daily lives, still the backdrop for even the good stuff we choose to do, so we can have us a nice, juicy dose of sort-of-normal now and then. So, do forgive me, those of you with kinder, gentler hearts than mine, but at the moment, I’ve got nothing insightful to say about 2011, nothing inspiring to say about 2012. And I don’t give a rodent’s derriere either. And I’m sure as hell not big on that ‘Hope’ shit. It may kill a few deer, but it hasn’t cured anything. Plans are good, though. I like plans. The best thing I accomplished last year was to re-learn (yes, I know…) how to make plans. And even to fulfill some of them. But plans are dicey, too. Because you never know. Because, as has been stated at the top of this blog for three years now, life is what happens when we’re making other plans. But you know what? A lot of us are still here. And for now, I’m quite blankety-blank-blank relieved about that. Let the bitching begin!

246,26,8,[Timestamp('2016-01-02 00:00:00')],"Published at: 05:01 pm - January 02, 2016 Carolyn, the Art of Breast Cancer I’d be the first to admit that 2015 was a shitastic year. Every damned week, sometimes every damned day, there seemed to be a news headline or three which served to highlight how batshit crazy, fearful, and murderous we humans can be. And that was when we in the Northeastern U.S. weren’t over our ears in snow, collapsed roofs, and power failures. Sometimes, the only way I hung onto my equanimity was to avoid any and all media. Then there were the personal losses. Several people I knew and loved died, most of them too young, many from breast cancer. But the one I will miss the most acutely died at the start of the penultimate week of 2015, five days before Christmas. She died of metastatic breast cancer. Her name is Carolyn Frayn. Even though it was a wretched year, losing Carolyn makes it painful to let go of 2015. I do not want to have to endure a new year without her friendship. I do not want to accept that there will be no more phone calls or texts or Skype chats or ridiculously long and funny and cozy conversations on Facebook chat with her. No meandering emails, no more mutual rants about Pinktober, no more of her art, no more trenchant, poetic writing on her blog, the Art of Breast Cancer. No more Carolyn. How can this be? Not for the first time in my life, I hate that the earth turns, impersonally, thoughtlessly, on its axis. Carolyn, 3 years before breast cancer One of the things I love (I refuse to use the past tense) about Carolyn is knowing that I am not the only person who could write a blog post like this. Because of MBC and its treatment, she pretty much felt like shit for most of the time I knew her. ‘Knew,’ fucking past tense. I think this might be the first time I’ve actually spelled out the word ‘fuck’ on this blog. Fuck. Fuckity fucking past tense. She was tired, sick, hurting, afraid, and angry a good deal of the time. Yet, she was also kind-hearted, intelligent, creative, loving, and hilariously funny. She generously sought and nourished several friendships with like-minded souls she met in our cyber community. I was only one of them. There is comfort in knowing that many, many people out there besides me love her (NOT in the past tense) and will miss her forever. One of them is her systir Julie Frayn, with whom I also became friends. As if it weren’t wonderful enough to know Carolyn, I also got to know Julie, a fellow writer and blogger, an award-winning novelist, and truly the best sibling on the face of the earth. Julie, who was by her side as often as possible during Carolyn’s last weeks on this earth. Julie, who also has a job, a home, and a mother with worsening Alzheimer’s. Julie, another smart, articulate, funny, beautiful, and good-hearted soul whose heart should never, ever have to endure such a soul-sucking loss. Goddammit. Julie & Carolyn Frayn, flipping systirs I have a misty memory of Carolyn and I stumbling upon each other’s blogs sometime in early 2013, not long after she published her first post. But we became friends because of a phrase. The phrase was ‘Fifty Shades of Pink.’ In the lead-up to Pinktober of that year, we had both written blog rants for which we wanted to use that title. I published mine, Fifty Shades of Pink — and Still No Cure, the day before she planned to publish hers. So, she emailed me to ask if I minded her using the same title. I told her that of course I didn’t mind, and was frankly surprised no one besides us had used the phrase for a post title before. So she published hers, Fifty Shades of Pink…the Rant, the next day. We both thought it would be great if all of our blog sisters flooded the blogosphere with posts of that title for Pinktober. That didn’t happen, but what did happen is that she and I became instant fast friends. We pretty much burned up Facebook chat and our email for three days straight. That soon led to phone calls, texts, Skype, any way we could communicate except a visit in person. Yes, we talked a lot about breast cancer suckage, and Pinktober suckage, and stupid, unaware people who do not get that breast cancer is not a pink sorority party. We also talked about families, and shitty relationships, and aging parents, and our art photography, and cameras, and kicking Photoshop’s ass, and kicking WordPress’s ass, and writing code, and Doctor Who, and nerdity and geekitude, and a lot of other things. One day, we spent hours on Facebook exchanging YouTube links of our favorite bits from British comedy shows. When she was enduring chemo — again — I sent her a really soft hat and a pair of the best socks ever, made of thick, hand-knit cotton. Once, when I failed to find a link to stream a British mystery show I wanted to watch, she got one of her sons to help me figure out how to download torrents and watch it that way. Didn’t matter much what the subject matter was. Whatever we talked about, it provided another opportunity to cuss eloquently, get silly, and make each other laugh. We shared friends in our cyber world. One in particular was Shelli Ray Gibbons, another friend with metastatic breast cancer, who wrote one of our favorite blogs, the Dirty Pink Underbelly. Another sister of snark, wit, and gloves-off candor, the three of us enjoyed a bond forged of those qualities, plus enormous affection and trust, until Shelli died of MBC on Valentines Day, 2014. Carolyn and I mourned her together and continued to cherish those brief months of our short-lived trio. Our favorite of Shelli’s posts is a classic that I plan to repost every Pinktober. Called, Any One of Us Could Go at Any Time, Shelli hilariously and utterly shredded that bromide that stupid people toss at folks who live with a disease they know they will die from: “Well, listen, any one of us could get hit by a bus tomorrow.” She described how an old friend of hers, who’d been in a severe car accident, told her that she thought of Shelli as she was waiting to be extricated from the hunk of metal that was once her car. “She thought of me and how any of us could Go at any time. Go in this instance being a euphemism for dying, not a confession that she had just soiled her underpants.” After destroying the euphemism in the rest of her post, Shelli ended it by saying, “Please discuss this post today and for my next post, let’s talk more about death[…] And what your thoughts are [in those] last few moments before you go. Again, by go, I mean die, not take a tinkle.” Once, during a Skype chat, Carolyn told me I might be crazy. I laughed. “You wouldn’t be the first to think so.” I said. “But why do you think I’m crazy?” “Shelli and I used to talk about you,” she said. “She loved you to pieces. We loved that you wanted to be friends with us, but, well, you know…she died. And I’m going to die. And that sucks.” “Yeah, that does suck.” I said. “Maybe I am crazy. But how could I not be friends with both of you? I mean, that’s not even possible.” “Yeah, but I come with an expiration date. I’ll probably die before you do.” “Yeah, maybe. But you do know, Carolyn, that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow. I mean, any one of us could go at any time. And by ‘go,’ I don’t mean tinkle.” Uproarious laughter. Carolyn & grandbabies, August, 2015 In one of her early posts, I Hope I Grow Moldy, Carolyn talked about her expiration date. My expiration date is between July 2015 and July 2022. I think the three years actually puts the minimal around July 2014, but I’ll go with 2015. The year 2022 if I am very very lucky. Do I feel lucky? All my life I have been the lemon person, then the lemon patient. If there is a small percentage of could have or might have been I’ll fall into that percentage. Who gets spinal meningitis twice? I do. After the stage IV bomb my sister gently told me that since we know this to be true, that I am the lemon, perhaps I will fall into that small percentage that lives those wonderful extra years with this impending death sentence, maybe I’ll die of something else. My family doctor reminded me that we all have an expiration date, I just happen to be able to reach out and touch it. Both of those statements struck me, I decided to simply strive to do well in my window, to live happily, to live fully. And you did, Carolyn. You surely did. And I’d have been crazy to have missed out on one nanosecond of our friendship.

248,26,9,[Timestamp('2015-12-02 00:00:00')],"Published at: 03:12 pm - December 02, 2015 Clutter in the attic. Wisely, I took two weeks off work during the beginning of Pinktober. This allowed me to post, comment, and hopefully help push the dialogue about genuine breast cancer awareness during the much-dreaded month of pointless pinksploitation. Highlights included promoting the efforts of Met Up, featuring the Die-In that took place in Washington, D.C., and the legislative agenda promoted by its organizers. Then, about halfway through Pinktober, the American Cancer Society released its new screening mammogram guidelines. Basically, the ACS was perhaps hoping to deliver clarity and options, but instead delivered confusion. A few valiant journalist friends attempted to sort it out, including Diane Mapes and Elaine Schattner. By the end of the month, I was so sick of the whole subject, I added my own parody post about it. Shortly thereafter, my stamina about ran out. I was back to work, trying to help my patients, including those with metastatic cancer, while a number of my cyber-sisters with metastatic breast cancer were experiencing crises of their own. As November progressed, I found I’d survived Pinktober, but a few of my dearest friends were increasingly at risk for not surviving at all. My heart got a thrashing. As two of these friends were moved into hospice care, I found myself both dreading to log onto social media for updates about them, and checking for updates about a million times a day. I know I don’t have to point out to most readers how profoundly we can connect online with our breast cancer sisters and brothers, and how much we end up loving them, even if we’ve never met them in person. At this moment, I don’t know what’s worse, feeling helpless about the suffering my friends are enduring while I am too far away even to hug them, or dreading the grief I know I will feel if and when I lose them. All I can say is that, during recent weeks, I have experienced a level of shock comparable to how I felt when I was first diagnosed with cancer myself. My emotional priorities shrunk. I became absentminded about the pedestrian details of daily life, like where I left my cellphone, and whether I had enough clean laundry. Then there were the stories of terrorist slaughter in Beirut and Paris, not to mention the constant barrage of wretched news stories about political idiocy and violence and the U.S. I think anyone might be forgiven for experiencing a meltdown. “So don’t mind if I fall apart. There’s more room in a broken heart. And I believe in love.” ~ Carly Simon Love and peace. Sometimes you can be too aware. Sometimes, you’ve just got to limit your exposure to the full freight of awareness. You’ve got to accept the fact that you can’t read and comment on every blog post or tweet or Facebook post about breast cancer, and not let yourself feel guilty about it. Sometimes, you’ve got to pick and choose your emotional priorities and recognize your limitations. Sometimes, you’ve got to admit that being a member of this miserable club can set you up for awareness fatigue. Sometimes, you have to sit with the consequences of how personal your own awareness is so that you can get off the couch and cope. It does no one any good to feel paralyzed. Let’s face it. I’ve been writing this blog for nearly seven years now, and it would not be a stretch to say that nearly every post I’ve written has been devoted to breast cancer awareness of one sort or another. I’m grateful that some of my blog sisters still have the wherewithal to continue raising the awareness bar with clarity and some well-placed righteous snark, because I’m flummoxed and tired. My snark is currently busted. Checking on my friends in crisis and letting them know how much I love them is about all the awareness I can handle. It’s interesting, though, how crises and sorrow can remind us of what’s important, what’s ultimately central to our lives, especially in this season. Loving my friends and making room for peace, that works for me.

It is almost October, you know — the time for breast cancer awareness, which really is just code for pushing products in the name of a cure in order to make a few extra bucks. And I don’t mean the dollars that fund breast cancer research (because if you really zero in on the percentage that goes to the cause, you’ll find it’s usually very minimal); I mean the cash that ends up padding the pockets of the people who turn their products pink. (And yes, there are some folks who donate every single cent earned to charity; thank you, folks, for that.) You might think going pink for a month is not a huge deal; heck, you might even buy some ribbon gear because you genuinely like it. No worries. I, myself, have bought into the hype in the past; I’ve even helped push the pink. As the years go on (almost 8 of them), though, I realize that I’m not all that into Pinktober. I am a fan of awareness, however, and that’s why I’m devoted to the 31 days that are right around the corner. But instead of supporting pinkwashing, I’m going raw. During the month of October, I pledge to post every day some sort of fact, figure, feeling, or photograph that is nothing but real.

Not everything mirrored what I personally encountered, but a lot of it did. Like the blurring effect a crushing diagnosis can have. Like the chemotherapy infusion room — same pink leathery chairs and same gathering of cancer patients making small talk that turns into something more. Like the shaving of the hair in preparation of the inevitable. Like the bald head. Like the pre-op room, with family standing by the bedside and doctors buzzing around, requesting signatures and pushing drugs that cause sleepiness. Like the post-op room, with family standing by smiling because the news is hopeful.

She rang me shortly after her devastating call arrived.

Fabulous bloggers, according to my definition, are folks whose well-written words and pretty photos inspire me to do better, be better, feel better. They are almost always women, and moms, and they work really hard at empowering others. They don’t pretend to be perfect (they sometimes eat donuts, skip workouts, raise voices, and let the laundry pile high). They strive for balance in their crazy days. They make me laugh. And the really, really good ones give away lots of free stuff. There are five fab bloggers in my world. Here they are: in HIS grace is a newbie to me, a blog I just recently stumbled upon, by way of a friend. WOW is what I have to say about Chrissie Grace, a way-clever, stay-at-home mother of four, plus artist, author, and poet. Chrissie chronicles her everyday life and amazing projects with few words and many photos (I love that!). Bonus: she links to her etsy shop, so all the rockin’ projects featured on her blog can be located and purchased with just a few clicks. One of my faves is this print: Click on image! Because she does pretty things with food, is tech/social media-savvy, and homeschools her kids (anyone who can do that for longer than half a day is, in my book, a hero), Christine and her ColorMePink blog rank right up there with the best of the best. I mean, the blog is pink, for one, and her presentation is slick, and there’s just such a wide variety of good stuff, I keep going back. And to think I might have never found this wonder woman had I not met her hubby, the money man at a Honda dealership, the day I bought a minivan. We talked blogging, he passed me her business card, and the rest is hisherstory. MizFit keeps me coming back, too. Recently named People’s Choice winner of the Fila Toning Real Women model casting call, this muscle momma is a rock star. She takes healthy eating and purposeful exercising and makes them seem so achievable. She is smart, witty, beautiful, and she knows her subject well (before and after photos prove it). No surprise she has a dedicated following. Not just on her blog, though — the girl tears things up on Facebook and Twitter, too! She is a force, for sure! Then there’s fitness guru Fitz, who first met me in her home gym, where she brought me back from the brink. Still in treatment for breast cancer, she took my weak, dizzy, bloated, blah self and morphed it into something strong and healthy. She convinced me I could run, when I swore I could not, and then she joined me for a Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 5K months later. Last year, I ran a half marathon, and yea, I think she had something do with major feat! OK, so back to the whole blog thing: Fitz has a blog, where she offers tips for optimal living, glimpses into the lives of fit celebs, and there’s never a shortage of giveaways (I just happened to win one — ChopKeeper cutting boards are all mine!) Click on image! Finally, my last fave: One in a Million, because I have a thing for the power of words, and this blog is full of words that make me smile.

411,29,252,[Timestamp('2016-11-18 00:00:00')],"November 12, 2010 I had the pleasure of joining a young breast cancer survivor discussion today at the University of Florida. Leading the chat was Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz, herself a breast cancer survivor, and my role was to listen, soak up the wisdom of shared stories, and talk to the group about how cancer affected my children and my parenting. Here’s my speech, which got me all choked up as I stood facing my audience. So, really, I’m not sure it was delivered like this at all. Hello, I’m Jacki. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 @ the age of 34. My kids were almost 4 and 18 months old. Now, I’m 40. Joey is 9. Danny is 7. To be totally honest, my first thought after hearing I had cancer was, “OMG, my hair!” I really did not want to lose my hair. Then, I started worrying about dying, and leaving my two little boys motherless. (Cue tears.) Some of my darkest moments came at night, while my babies were sound asleep. I’d watch them and contemplate their lives without me. (More tears.) Mornings were always brighter, and it was during these hours it dawned on me that my kids were going to be just fine, no matter what. And throughout my surgery, chemo, radiation, and more, they really went about life without much notice of what was going on around them. Danny, the younger one has no real memory of my bald head, my sick tummy, my two hospital stays. I don’t think his big brother remembers too much either, although he did help shave my head, and he can recall bits and pieces of that emotional night. “It’s only a haircut, mommy,” he told me. “You’re not going to die.” He was right. It was only a haircut. And here I am, almost 6 years later, and they are still stuck with me. A few thoughts on how cancer shaped my kids and my parenting: Whether they remember it or not, my kids know I had cancer. They knew from the very beginning because I told them I had a boo-boo in my boobie, a doctor would take it out, I would take medicine, my hair would fall out, and I would be OK. I was honest — they know the whole story, and they’ve pretty involved in the whole journey! Wearing my hats. Making Strides Against Breast Cancer. my Cancer blog. Joey wore pink shoelaces in his football cleats this October. Fun with freebie promo items — I write about and review everything from books to yoga mats to pink tire cap valves to cancer-inspired headbands. Packaging and sending a wig to a friend in Ohio. Cancersaurus. Cancer gave me an at-home writing career (I was discovered 18 months after starting to write my blog), which allows me to work in the mornings, and hang out with Joey and Danny in the afternoons. Perfect. Cancer taught me (well, it’s still teaching me) to stress less. And that’s good for my kids. Cancer taught me to cherish the moment, and since my kids take up most of my moments, I savor those boys more. Does that mean I don’t get frustrated and yell at them? Nope. I’m human — just aware that they are precious little people, who helped save my life. (Tears, tears, tears.) When I was first diagnosed, I imagined that dealing with a disease might be easier without kids. I quickly realized it was easier with kids. My boys kept me busy and distracted. There was no time to feel sorry for myself. And I am grateful for that! (Tears.) (The end.)",1,1,0.1388726919339164

You’d be wrong, according to sociologist Gayle A. Sulik, author of “Pink Ribbon Blues.” In the time since the war on cancer began 40 years ago, things have gotten worse, not better, says Sulik. In fact, a woman now has a 1-in-8 chance of getting breast cancer in her lifetime. Used to be 1 in 11 — in 1975. And the risk of dying from the disease, upon diagnosis, decreased only .05 percent from 1990 to 2005. Pretty sobering stats, huh? Sulik has more to say on the topic: She weighs in on Susan G.

Or you might choose to score some eggs not for eating, but for science. No hard-core research or anything like that. I’m talking elementary school science experiment stuff here. egg, glass, vinegar, bubbles OK, so get yourself one EB egg, preferably a pink ribbon egg. And a glass. And some vinegar. Now, gently place the egg in the glass, and pour in the vinegar, until it completely covers the egg. Take a peek at the pink ribbon on the egg, because in a day or so, it won’t look the same! After about 24 hours, remove the egg, and check out what happened: Your egg should be completely soft. Puncture it, and the egg will run out intact, but the shell will have become rubbery. And that pink ribbon? Probably gone or morphed into a pink smudge. Here’s the science behind this experiment: Egg shells are made up of calcium carbonate, and the vinegar is made up of acetic acid. The acid dissolves the shell, and calcium ions float way from the egg into the vinegar while the carbonate turns into carbon dioxide — this is why you’ll see bubbles forming on the egg. My 9-year-old Joey won’t eat an egg (picky eater!), but he loved this experiment. Easy enough that he could do it completely on his own — twice. Need a kid activity? We recommend this one!

I just couldn’t pass on sharing these little red boots on the feet of cute little Lily. I know, the spiffy kicks are not pink, and there’s no obvious breast cancer message attached to them, but there is some hidden meaning, if you really think about it. Lily is a wee one, innocently making a shiny fashion statement, no idea what lies ahead as she grows into a bigger girl, a teenager, a young adult, a woman. Gosh, she’s got so much greatness ahead of her — school, friends, jobs, relationships, hopes, and dreams. There’s also some scary stuff — like breast cancer. You see, Lily belongs to camp that is threatened. Unless things get better, she will inherit a 1 in 8 chance of diagnosis, and that makes me just plain sad. Here’s my plea: Let Lily and her red boots remind you of all the little girls in the world who deserve a future free of breast cancer. Do your part to make their world a better place — educate yourself, teach your girls how to care for their bodies, spread awareness, donate your time (and money if you have some to spare).

473,29,308,[Timestamp('2017-01-13 00:00:00')],"I Will Keep on Trying My name is Nancy Stordahl and I am pleased to have the opportunity to write a guest post today. I lost my mother to breast cancer in 2008 and found the experience to be quite devastating, so of course I decided to write about it. Writing gave me purpose. Writing gave me back a sense of control and power. Or so I thought. I realized my risk of developing breast cancer was significantly higher than the average daughter since my mother carried the BRCA2 gene. However, I thought surely I would not get cancer until I was at least as old as she was when diagnosed. She was 74. I was convinced I had time. Cancer could not strike again in the same family so quickly. That would be too cruel. I was wrong. Cancer is cruel. In April of this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and soon realized that we never have as much time as we think we do. Before determining my treatment path, I was tested and discovered that I also carry the BRCA2 gene. In June I had a bilateral mastectomy and began the reconstruction process. Currently I am finishing up chemo therapy. Naturally, I turned to writing once again in order to maintain my sanity, sense of control and also hopefully to be a resource for other women – with or without cancer. That’s why I started my new blog www.nancyspoint.com. I tell myself every day it’s perhaps why I got breast cancer – in order to make some small difference. I hope that doesn’t make me sound arrogant. That’s not my intent; it’s just what I tell myself each day to keep going. The arrival of October, Breast Cancer Awareness month and all the pinkness out there obviously has extra significance to me this year. I never really believed I would be in the position of having breast cancer myself. Who does? But here I am, like too many other women, another statistic. We all somehow think we are immune. We are not. Almost everyone at least knows someone affected by this disease. Too many women will develop it themselves. Therefore, we all need to be advocates for women’s health (men’s too, of course) in general. So, I will happily and with optimism for making a difference write about awareness here and in my own blog. I will put my pink ribbon decal in my car window in the hopes that someone will see it and think about getting a mammogram or making a donation. I will try not to be annoyed by all the businesses using this month to self-promote. I will remember the startling statistic that a woman dies every 69 seconds somewhere in the world from breast cancer. I will use whatever voice I have to help eradicate this disease so that my daughter and other people’s daughters might not have to get breast cancer. I will keep on surviving. I will keep on writing. I will keep on trying to make a difference. I have the great pleasure of meeting so many inspiring people through this whole blogging thing, and today, I introduce you to my new friend Nancy. Nancy is a wife, a mom of three kids (and two dogs), a writer, and like so many of us, a breast cancer survivor. You know what that means? She’s got a story!

I lost my mother to breast cancer in 2008 and found the experience to be quite devastating, so of course I decided to write about it. Writing gave me purpose. Writing gave me back a sense of control and power. Or so I thought. I realized my risk of developing breast cancer was significantly higher than the average daughter since my mother carried the BRCA2 gene. However, I thought surely I would not get cancer until I was at least as old as she was when diagnosed. She was 74. I was convinced I had time. Cancer could not strike again in the same family so quickly. That would be too cruel. I was wrong. Cancer is cruel. In April of this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and soon realized that we never have as much time as we think we do. Before determining my treatment path, I was tested and discovered that I also carry the BRCA2 gene. In June I had a bilateral mastectomy and began the reconstruction process. Currently I am finishing up chemotherapy. Naturally, I turned to writing once again in order to maintain my sanity, sense of control and also hopefully to be a resource for other women – with or without cancer. That’s why I started my new blog www.nancyspoint.com. I tell myself every day it’s perhaps why I got breast cancer – in order to make some small difference. I hope that doesn’t make me sound arrogant. That’s not my intent; it’s just what I tell myself each day to keep going. The arrival of October, Breast Cancer Awareness month and all the pinkness out there obviously has extra significance to me this year. I never really believed I would be in the position of having breast cancer myself. Who does? But here I am, like too many other women, another statistic. We all somehow think we are immune. We are not. Almost everyone at least knows someone affected by this disease. Too many women will develop it themselves. Therefore, we all need to be advocates for women’s health (men’s too, of course) in general. So, I will happily and with optimism for making a difference, write about awareness here and in my own blog. I will put my pink ribbon decal in my car window in the hopes that someone will see it and think about getting a mammogram or making a donation. I will try not to be annoyed by all the businesses using this month to self-promote. I will remember the startling statistic that a woman dies every 69 seconds somewhere in the world from breast cancer. I will use whatever voice I have to help eradicate this disease so that my daughter and other people’s daughters might not have to get breast cancer. I will keep on surviving. I will keep on writing. I will keep on trying to make a difference. If you’d like to share your breast cancer story, just let me know in the comments, and I’ll be in touch!",1,1,0.011710027910685808

I’ve said it all here before, I weighed in over at AOL Health last year, and my mind has not really changed at all. Still, I’ll sum it up for you again, as we embark on a month that can be a little overwhelming. I’m a fan of the color pink. I liked it long before breast cancer meant anything to me. I’m grateful to anyone who donates funds to the cause, because the way I see it, every penny counts. So, I’m not mad at any company offering to charity just $5 per purchase of something that costs much more, because, hey, $5 is $5. And if someone caps their donation at oh, say, $20,000, that’s OK, too. It’s still a hefty donation, and more than I could ever give. Yea, when .10 cents is the magic number, I admit I do kinda judge. Of course, I think donating 100% is ideal, and I’ll feature this month a rare gem or two generous enough to give everything they’ve got. While I am thankful when anyone donates funds to help women like me survive a nasty disease, I will not personally back a product that is not healthy or has been shown to contribute to obesity, illness, or disease. Like alcohol, or fried chicken, or well, you know what I mean, right? Eggs, I can do, and my partnership with Eggland’s Best (EB) feels right. Eggs are nutritious, plus EB’s eggs are cage free, and the organic hen diet consists of healthy grains with no animal fat, no animal byproducts, and no recycled or processed food. No added hormones, antibiotics, or steroids either. Good news: EB is donating $50,000 to Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Which brings me to another point. I like to know where the money is going. No generic claims of “will be donated to breast cancer research.” If it’s legit, a specific charity should be named. I have a few other thoughts on the matter — for example, If I’m going to buy a product anyway, and one brand gives to the cause and the other doesn’t, and both items cost the same, I’ll probably buy the pink one. But I think that’s enough. On with October!",1,1,0.13773496240601507

Today, I learned that about 30% of breast cancer cases are linked to excess body fat. I also learned that being overweight increases chances of poor long-term health following breast cancer remission and that overweight breast cancer survivors are at higher risk for heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and other chronic diseases.

There was a yummy gyro, a delish tuna sandwich, a great turkey sub, and I can’t remember the fourth one — which is exactly my point: I can’t remember. Time has erased my memory of the food that so repulsed me I couldn’t eat it for years. Years! It’s been five years since my chemotherapy ended.

I thought you would be in a little room on your own. And I thought everyone would be crying.’; Well, it’s obv she didn’t read it properly. It is clear to me though that I have been lacking in descriptive skills. Attempt Number 2 then: patients either have a bed with sheets and blankets or a shiny leather-look dark blue armchair. Most have another person sitting with them. There is a drip stand on wheels by every bed or chair. In the centre of the room is a giant table with trays full of drug bags or syringes, and equipment like tape, tubes, needles etc. On small tables beside each chair there are cardboard receptacles for throwing up into. There is a trolley where your helper can get tea. The windows are massive and there is good natural light. There are two other connecting rooms off the bigger room which hold maybe six or seven armchairs. Patients trundle their drips to the loo regularly because they are drinking like mad to flush out the poisons. The atmosphere is pretty chilled as most people are laughing and greeting each other like old friends. A few seem more anxious and still.; My nurse today was Sanjay.

He had four syringes on a tray which he inserted one after the other into the tube feed. Two big red ones, Epirubicin. It is strong, he told us. He seemed less worried about the two smaller syringes with the Fluoro-whatever-it-is, and the Cyclo-whatever-it-is.; Chloe went and chatted to my chemo-friend Heather who was sadly four seats away from me. ‘I put you in the blog, Heather,’ I shouted. ‘Do you mind?’; ‘No, not at all,’ she yelled, looking pleased.; Oh, good, I’ll do it again then.; Came home feeling fine.

I set my slozerlok to strongtretch and uppiprugs on lo-dose (obvion you canti have hi-dose at home), as toolmond needs anintzibitov help on their first day at a nouvotrav.; I got out of my slozerlok quitehigh as I donti often do uppies. I had had multiple slozerixes during the night. Now it felt like I could overstand everything more clearlon.; I had a fokka peer in the mirruv, darskstraining with stration. ?What did I wanti look like. I decided not to self-refer too blatelon, like not all green, just two straglog thin referencing stripes mongst a mass of greyish-vlu vurls. I put in a largish propper, ooh, paynfullon shizzos that, just nough to create a mild Outpout, and vlossed my vlips a pale pink. I vurled my vressis all in the same rection, and gelled them there firm. As a termin touch, I put one silvastic clit-hancer through my clitpiercing. I sav clit-hancers are slightlon exoshwerve, but people sociate them with the totlon thirties when bissliss was so up and the trilly fashwerve dustry leaptexo as most portant of all. I wantied to look bislisslike and how I was prettado anything the nouvo vail could throwat me.; I left the partmo, exostept my bloklok and got strate on the boo. I doded ixes all the way but was too petriffob to zorb anything. I reached Shwervemanshon by eight. I had been told to straightdrong to the fifty-first vel. The sensor took me up. It was mirruved and I was lone so I got a chance to mire my moufleur. The Outpout and pinkened vlips exostood nicelon gainst the foncy-grey hardened vurls of flair.; The sensor rived at vel fifty-one. I steptexinto a pale urple riddor. Ixes rected me to a cubby to the right. I was mitted and taken to an urfupdarskfitting. Sitting there in the dark with a soothing zicstream, I thort bout things. ‘Urfupping your filters, colours, sound,’ they dixed.; I exostept, mazed at the trilly quality of my nouvo pikups.; A scurity tadarsed at the door. He had green vressis, and yes, you’ve guessed it, the vringe, vadderangle, vurls, all of it. He used his mote to tripflip his vadder as I troed throughinto a huge cavernub area full of state-of-thart indi-cubes. High vaults bove us were hung with plushyplush velvy curving curtains. Moving lights played mongst the curtainfolds.; Bout ten dells were strutting on a fakie-red-carpet in frontov rows of seated media people. The dells all had the new green look. I darskooed for a mint, miring my creation. All gether in a glinting, groomed row like that, I could blep it reallon was a fokkadokka design. I felt proud.; A man troed ward to meet me. ‘Nerd to make your quaintessence,’ he said.; ‘Nerd,’ I plied.; One man was tadarsing hind a tablon, pulling ixes ontosplay. He turned round to bleppat me. His vaddervanilli waved from side to side. He had not gone for the green, but had a spensive–blepping dark red sunray hanced by a flittaking bright pulse and long dishioned blond and orange vressis, sewn with silver threads, sweeping the floor. Hmm, his flairdresser was doing grooty trav.; ‘So, Kedda,’ he murtered. He dronged wardme and allowed his vaddervanilli to brush gainst my moufurls politelon. ‘Gratulation on your urfupping. I am Iffer, Genital of Topinf.’; !Miley. I had heard of Topinf, a nucleus specialising in the mozzlon boundary-pushing shwervixes. ?Who hanti. !Topinf vailed for Miley herself. !I would nevah in my follest slozerixes have spected I would be vailing for Topinf, !let alone Topinf’s Genital.",1,1,0.11058352357278137
746,33,32,[Timestamp('2015-03-24 00:00:00')],"(Again, all-new, exclusive article for your pleasure and information.); Tu-Gin-Su, Hav-U, F***ing Boring and I went to the Castle. You go up New Town road and take a left. It’s tucked away, but cheerily lit and welcoming.; As soon as we went in I was just delighted. Why oh why have I lived in this town for fourteen years and never been in this place? It’s ADORABLE. A tortoiseshell cat called Titch lay sprawled across two bar stools. There’s soft pinkish flowery wallpaper. The place looks like it hasn’t changed for decades. Nobody’s messed with it. There’s a bell, a brass knight, a darts board, a Martini mirror. In the next room there is a Kit-kat clock, a Finest Scotch Whisky mirror, old paintings, wooden shiny panelling and notice-boards with kids’ pictures. We asked the bar-maid if a picture of a pub was the Castle. She asked someone else, who said, ‘nah, got that from a charity shop.’ They really haven’t tried too hard (in a good way). It’s original, and secret. Til now, ha ha.; We headed to a cosy corner near a fireplace, book shelves, a pile of board games, and a chilled chap called Paul who was doing the crossword. We stood our drinks on Brigadier beer mats with ‘Bang on,’ written on them. Tu-Gin-Su nodded at the curtains: ‘1980s M’nS’. She knows about such things. We chortled over a ‘Worzel Gummidge’ annual, ‘The Commonwealth Book of Cricket No. 3’, and ‘Deborah’s Secret Quest.’; F***ing Boring went to the hole in the wall cubbyhole thingy to get more gins and kit-kats. She wants to set Hav-U up with her cousin. He’s popping over from some far-flung place. ‘You’ll only have a day and a half to make it work,’ she said.; Hav-U, in her normal, sceptical mode, looked singularly unimpressed with the plan.; Fucking Boring told us about her first wedding, in France. The priest ranted on in French for ages: ‘blurgh, blurgh, blurgh, blurgh.’ The interpreter waited several minutes for a little pause, looked at the congregation, said, ‘Firstly…’ and looked back at the interpreter expectantly. It was apparently very funny/you kind of had to be there.; ‘Are we walking the ponies Sunday morning?’ asked Tu-Gin-Su.; ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘of course.’; ‘Or is it…hmm, weather-dependent?’ she asked.; I realised she meant, ‘You-not-being-hungover-dependent’. The last Sunday she met me at the ponies I was in recovery from Maura-next-door’s killer cocktails. Tu-Gin-Su took off rugs and picked up poos on her ownio while I lay on the grass puking quietly into the thistles. Not good. I should follow Fucking Boring’s lead and give up drink. My body has identified it as a poison.; I loved this pub so much though that when the others got up to leave, I borrowed two quid from the kitty and stayed for another half. The bar-maid didn’t realise I only had two quid til she’d poured most of a pint so I got the biggest half you’ve ever seen. I rang Fred who was on the train and asked if he would come home via the Castle. Got chatting to Paul in the interim. He said there used to be a great pub called the Fox, opposite the vet in Rye Street. ‘Pokey, three bars, proper olde worlde,’ he said wistfully. I told him I’d fallen instantly in love with this pub and he said, ‘yeah, it’s because nobody knows about it, we’ve got it to ourselves.’ Oops. Don’t say I told you.; Fred turned up and got a pint of Doombar in.; We rummaged amidst the board-games and came across: ‘Mid-Life Crisis.’ We couldn’t resist and started rolling the dice, hopping through our thirties, forties, fifties, and zapping each other with divorce and stress points.; Crisis after crisis drove us to drink: I had another Guinness, Fred tried a pint of Seafarer’s.; The game made us die laughing. ‘You discover your child’s nursery teacher is on drugs. Add 100 stress points.’ ‘Your spouse has been leading a double life. Take a CRISIS card.’ ‘You discover what a proctologist does for a living. Take a CRISIS card.’ ‘You haven’t been feeling well, so you see a psychiatrist who tells you you haven’t been feeling well. Pay £1000.’ I need to have this game for Christmas. Sign up anyone who wants to join in: we’ll be playing round the clock.; We said goodbye to purring black and white Oreo, and Titch. The bar-maid told us they are part of a great clan. It reads like Genesis: Mittens begat Alfie, Oreo, and Sprite, who begat Ella and Bisto, who begat Titch and Zorro…; ‘Litrally’ what have I been doing all my life? *strikes head* I should have been taking a daily stroll with all and sundry through the grave-yard to the Castle.",1,1,0.03197375541125542
753,33,39,[Timestamp('2014-12-31 00:00:00')],"I could see it. You’ve slipped into a parallel universe. It gives you the shivers slightly. The pub smells good though, of wood and leather. There are fat squashy sofas but the other seats are not for comfort. Hard, angular wood. An old black barrel props up the bar.; We pored over the non-politically-correct shots menu. It’s designed so that someone can look at your drink and say ‘Oh, what have you got there?’ and you reply, ‘I’ve got a Creamy Pussy,’ ‘I’ve got a Wet Crotch,’ or ‘I appear to have myself a Panty Hamster.’ We scanned for equivalent male jokes. The nearest was the Martian Hardon. We decided that the shots menu should include, for the sake of equality, at the very least a ‘Sweaty Bollock,’ a ‘Pimply Knob,’ and a ‘Limp Shaft.’; I was tempted to ask if I could have a Shit on the Grass, but we ended up getting our favourite G n Ts all round. We were just moving on to pints of Guinness when a kind local came over to the jukebox and asked us what we would like to listen to.; ‘Ooh!’ we said, possibilities fanning out.; ‘Yeah, go for it,’ she said.; Jeez, that jukebox is a fabulous museum. You can type in the date of your birth. You can have Top of the Pops from any year. We chose the BeeGees, with video. Then we chose some Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Pink Floyd and some Abba. If you don’t choose video, you just get screenfuls of trippy visuals.; A steady stream of dudes passed by, heading to the smokers’ deck. This pub bristles with weathered characters. Why bother with Harry Potter World when you have a real Diagon Alley experience on your doorstep? If you want loos that lock and smiley-happy-plastic-people, don’t choose this pub. If you want vibe in buckets, give it a go. It particularly hots up late at night, after other pubs shut, when you squeeze past a couple of forbidding bouncers. My friend Jeanette herds her mates in here for champagne chasers at 1am. Yeah, she’s a party animal.; There was a picture on the wall of a pink ‘Goldfish Bowl.’ The barman said we could fill it with anything we wanted. He didn’t have any Butterbeer, but offered Vodka, (Mad Lucy perked up at the very thought), Brandy, Lemonade, Gin, Malibu…. We went for a Woo-Woo in the end. Or was it a Wah-Wah? Oh, no, that’s Debbie’s dog’s name, Wah-Wah. I know, poor wee thing! With a name like that you’re not gonna get far, are you? Anyway, eight straws make this a truly communal experience during which you bump noses, so best do it with friends. Top tip: if you’re a bit keen like me, you can slurp up way more than your share and nobody will know unless you fall off the pavement on the way home.; Someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned round. There was nobody there. Mad Lucy gave me a little nod. She can see them, the ghosts of Stortford. Oh yes, she can even talk to them.; We chose songs for our funerals. This is a recurrent theme every time we hit a darker pub or go on a road trip. We have to sing them too, of course, clashing with the jukebox or not. ‘I want ‘Here Comes the Sun’,’ said Just Boring.; ‘Bit of a dark choice?’ we asked.; ‘It’s to recognise the relief felt by the funeral-goers,’ she said.; Hav U wanted ‘Alive and Kicking’ by Simple Minds. Or Louis Armstrong’s ‘What a Wonderful World.’ Ironic, given the pessimist she is. Tu-Gin-Su chose ‘Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.’ Yeah, great choice, Su, ‘C’mon baby let’s not fight, we’ll go dancing and everything will be alright!‘ Slightly deluded future tense there, one might say.; Jet-setting Jen wanted something by Kool and the Gang and/or Frank Sinatra. Mad Lucy said Bowie’s ‘Star Man’. I always choose ‘Seasons in the Sun’ by Terry Jacks. Come on! ‘We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun….’ At least mine’s in the past tense, Su.; Just for the record and in case I forget, my husband Fred says he wants ‘Knock Knock Knocking on Heaven’s Door’ and ‘Thus Spake Zarathustra’ from 2001 Space Odyssey. This is the best though: my cousin Roland went to a funeral where they played ‘If You Don’t Know Me By Now.’ Ha ha, genius. ‘You will never never never know me.’ Cracks me up.",1,1,0.02591820987654321
757,33,42,[Timestamp('2015-01-02 00:00:00')],"‘Ooh, you are having fun,’ Mad Lucy texted back. I think she had misinterpreted my order more as a mis-spelt, uncharacteristically confessional status update.; I ignored her lewdness and carried on: ‘Silent Movie Night after, Hockerill. In aid of Massive Organ.’; ‘Fnarr fnarr,’ she replied.; Some of us were slightly late. She texted ‘Lone woman in dodgily named pub. Come quickly.’; The sandy-coloured inn has grown out of the ancient Hockerill crossroads. It’s endearingly medieval. Wonky as hell. Used to have a courthouse and jail attached. Called the Black Lion in the 15 th century, and later The Vernon’s Head, it was a stopping place for stage-coaches on the East-Anglia to London road. Attendants would stay there, their employers preferring the posher Crown Inn or Red Lion opposite. The front of the pub proclaims: ‘Circa 1547’. Those walls have witnessed endless brawls, murders, back-street abortions, plagues. How many babies were conceived there? How many ghosts haunt its rooms? And how many middle-aged women hang out there drinking gin?; I fought my way to the right through the throng of blokes. The bar-girl cocked her head the other way, ‘They’re in the snug.’ How did she know I was with them? I suppose not being a bloke was a clue. Mad Lucy and Calamity Claire were hogging a sofa in front of a wide window onto the street. A pram was there with heaped blankets. ‘Ooh, a baby,’ I said.; They roared with laughter. ‘I stole it,’ Mad Lucy said. I hoped she was lying but she is mad, so you never really know.; ‘D’you see all those blokes, propping up the bar?’ I whispered, eyes popping.; ‘Couldn’t miss them,’ said Claire.; Jet-setter Jen turned up in over-the-knee boots offset by turquoise feathery snood. We’re lucky to see her, as she’s normally on a plane. ‘Ooh, whose baby?’ she asked excitedly.; ‘Mine, I stole it,’ said Mad Lucy.; Two-gin Sue, so named because after two gins she goes pink and takes her clothes off, appeared looking like a Bond girl, fluffy hair, black lycra, blowing the smoking muzzle of her imaginary gun. ‘Ooh, is that a baby?’ she asked Mad Lucy.; ‘Yes, she stole it,’ we chorused.; We put money in the kitty. Guinness for me, GnTs for Claire and Sue, cider for Jill, vodka for Mad Lucy. See, you don’t have to drink Gin, but it helps.; People kept walking past the window and looking in, like we were a fairground freak-show. We didn’t mind. Knocked back more drinks just to be sure. A bunch of teachers came in and nabbed the other sofa. They looked at ‘our’ pram. We looked suitably proprietorial. I chatted with Mr Pollard who used to teach my Chloe, poor man, no wonder he needs a few beers.; As I returned from the bar the street lamp was shining through the stencilled door-pane. ‘C**K’ was inscribed clearly in black shadow on my stool. LOL! My sense of humour has always stopped short of sophisticated, which is why, apart from my friend Gemsy-Wemsy, I’m the only person I know who loves that crude TV show ‘B*ttom‘.; We planned forthcoming Stortford pub crawls. Claire told me the Boar’s Head up Windhill used to be known as the Wh*re’s Bed. Despite living up Windhill, I’d never heard that! Someone decided we would start our own pub for older women, with gin, counselling, disco nights, to be called the C**k and Swallow. From there, we got onto s*x. Thing is, if we haven’t talked about s*x, we don’t feel like Gin Club has happened.; People sometimes stop me in the street and say, ‘I wish I had a Gin Club.’ I invite them along. If they can’t come, I say ‘All you need is some gin, tonic, and one friend. Even an acquaintance will do: by the end of the bottle they will surely be your friend.’ (Top tip: get the acquaintance to bring crisps.) So DON’T PANIC! You can all have a Gin Club….unless you are a teetotaller in which case you can have a Grapefruit Juice Club, which, must be said, doesn’t have the same ring.; Only once a week, though, otherwise you’ll probs go alcoholic. And always remember the first rule of Gin Club: don’t talk about Gin Club. Oops, I zip my lip.; NB: no abandoned or stolen babies were hurt in the making of this article.",1,1,0.00954469507101085
776,33,6,[Timestamp('2016-02-07 00:00:00')],"After Katoline’s three vampoos for the magoline, my spiney ached. Tubed a killapayn. Early aftube I started vlombing and plaiting. I took over from Dalla on spamduty for an hour. I canti believe this diculous trav hasn’t been autommed. But tristlon, only humans can be proper spamspotters, as them infhackers are so sharpysharp. !Miley. !It’s demeaning.; A chap came in ziring a lengthening cone. We used to do them all the time, but that was before shorter vaddervanillis became all the shwerve. Then a striking vlady with thick pink-painted vlips and florlong black vurls turned up. She siddered me, darsktipping. ‘I troobi your beads and knots and pearls,’ she said.; ‘I can easlion do beads and knots and pearls for you if you troobit.’; ‘No, I’m… I’m after an Outpout.’; ‘You do alpretta have an Outpout,’ I said, siddering her swollen vlips.; ‘Yeah,’ she snapped, ‘but I zire a Dashpout.’; I was afeared. A Dashpout, the most streme form of the trilly fashwervable Outpout, is a throwback from the late thirties. A Dashrim, which creates the Dashpout, is more tensitens than the more normynorm tempy softproppers. Dashes are not easy to sert, nor to stract, so people keep them in for several months, or til they get fected. I have done Outpouts for vladies, course, but nevah a Dash. I did have to put one on a mannequin for my last xam at school. They’re riculoso, that’s the problet. It was Kitti-two, the last of the Kardashi dynasty, who made Dashes all the shwerve then promptlion deddered of fection from her tretchwounds.; Wever, who am I to argue? I’m just doing my trav. Gotta keep the cuzmo happihapps. I made the vlady send consent through to my darsk. I fetched a sterile Dashrim from the drawer. I jected the mons and vlips with killapayn, vlombed her thick vressis away from her whorl, wiped it with antisep and serted the metal spikes swinefully, twisting til they bit. Then I pumped up the rim. I litters would never do this to myself because once the killapayn has worn off, a Dashrim will ache. Must admit though, the way it forces the pout up and out is pressive. Even when you’re dronging up the street, people can litters see right into your whorl. You are montring your trueinf to the world. It’s the ultimate in confessional, which is bangup. Everyone is wantiing to know the real you, like deep inside you, but litters.; I sat exo on the bench with my moufleur in the smogga. It might be looted but at least it’s cool. You don’t want your make-up to run. You see ixes from the thirties where people’s vascara had run. They dinti know much then. And the fashwerve was so basic. ?Like vlipliner under your whorl. No one would do that now, unless they were carrying off retro trilly well. It’s all about the upper line now. A strong, fiddent upper line. And the way they used to put vanilliliner all the way round the vadderbase…it’s presk larious. Now, it’s more suttle, yet also more bold. Katoline is constlon banging on about bold. Some people just get it stinctively. I do. I was born with the knowledge. My doptive says the day I was louvered to her door, age one day, I was alpretta trilly sinnated by design. You just pick it up from all around you.; I had the vantage of growing up in my doptive cuddlecupple’s quiltigymna. A quiltigymna is more about the feel-fokka factor than normal gymnas. My doptive and her partner Rissa had thirty pummelcubes and ran a bar too, where you could hire safeprugspace or vlatticubes. Safeprugs came in after the monstrol Festideath. Not larious, ten thousand dedders in one night from looted prugs. Now of course, everything’s legal and better tested so you’re less likelon to dedder… less you’re hookton vlattivamp, course.; Vlattivamp makes you feel fokkadokka though. You rampit rough, you’re like wild or something, oozing fiddence. My friend Shadda, she got deddered on Vlattivamp. You can just litters fiddence yourself exolife. You have so much fiddence that you forget to have fear. And you take more and more, in one seshal, til you’re vlatting so hard your midden aches and your moufleur weeps. You dedder rough, real and wild, but… you dedder.",1,1,0.1186676798378926

The flor was tablowed in snippyvressis so I moptup the streaks of dye and tivated the aftopull.; On the way homeyhome I tubed a cutty at the corner jop. Liza was still vailing as she needs the bits. Her vressis are so long they brush the flor. ‘They’ll be trippin you up,’ I dixed.; ‘They are statement vressis, Kedda.’; ‘Yeah, tever,’ I said. She donti bleppa that it acshi donti look that fokka having your vressis so long. Hers are quitegrooty though, with beads and shells and thin urple streaks all the way down. Her vinehous black nest trudes quitefar. It rather scures her naturellon pouty vlips, that’s the only thing. A bit of a waste.; She sat down side me exo on her bench for a mint. We darsk-sinked and zorbed the day’s catwalk freshtuff. Top dells from Ladvadd were strutting soft-vurled vressis. I spotted my broze, in a trilly-polished monokrom onsomb flecked with glitter and mirruvs. My bezzi Blokka from Beauty School was just behind him with a stravagant array of white feathuzz litup with pulse hancing his ninety-degree vadderangle. Not much gets past this man. You can always tell it’s Blokka, as he takes tiny steps, litters three inches at a time. Trip trippity trip, that’s Blokka, and he wonti be hurried.; Two zistance girls dronged past Liza and me, shouting ‘Fight! Fight! Donti put up with it!’ We dinti even mention them, as we’re so tired of it. All over, they are. Another came past and tripped up over our feet. ‘TRUEINF WILL OUT,’ she cried. She rolled over, her sal nodeccoed moufdreds spilling exo round a flappy nopout, picked herself up and troed off.; Our zorbstream had been trupted so we undarsk-sinked. ‘Bit of a shame, with that vine, how you canti sern your vlips,’ I dixed.; ‘Yeah, but least I donti have to bother with vlitox, vlipstick, all that,’ she said, ‘and I couldn’t do without my vine.’ She patted it fondlon.; Someone must have bothered to call spambort on those zistance girls, as the van swooped past us. I dinti say anything. I dinti like to tell Liza that her vine, any vine, looked tellment exoshwerve now.; I took the boo two stops home. The sensor took me up thirty vels. My splay was glittring. It was my bezzibez and topvizer Dunqui. I can tell when she’s zausted, as she props a cushol tween darskside and shoulder. ‘?Termined trav,’ she asked.; ‘Yes, ?you.’; ‘Only just.’ She pulled a vresstip across her whorl: ‘I’m tellment termined.’; ‘?Articles.’; ‘Litters all day.’; ‘So ?what’s the latest trilly fash.’; ‘Hmm…mod piercings mainlon.’; I know lotsinf on mod fashwerve, thank Miley, as I used to vail in a mod sessories jop. Obvion, tween vaddervanillis and moufleurs you gottaspect a wide range of constantlon vlopping modiffs.; ‘?Also reretro vapearlies,’ dixed Dunqui.; ‘!Vapearlies, ?who would’ve ixagined.’; Dunqui keeps me bangup. She savs what’s dronging on. Sometimes it’s me telling her though, it’s zarre: it’s like I’m on the flor, strugging away, while she’s just rubbing about it. Rubbing’s not hard, scooping ideas exof the smogga and popping them onsplay. She donti have to darskpeer all day at vadderangles like me.; But I have to have Dunqui, as she gives me fiddence, and you have to have fiddence in yourself and your topvizers to be a fokka fashwerver. Without Dunqui, I wouldn’t sav, I’d be guessing. And you canti reallon guess with the fashwerve. It’s just too random to believe and changes every couple of hours. Even with all the darskinf you can zorb, you canti dict it.; ‘Eh,’ she dixed, ‘your mate Blokka.’; ‘?Yeah. I just bleppaed him onsplay.’; ‘?With the feathuzz.’; ‘Yeah. Bit takkytak for him, I thort.’; ‘That design… it is takkytak, cos it’s bitchybitch Yana’s.’; ‘!No.’ I sclaimed. ‘?He vailing for Yana.’; ‘Must be. He problion donti sav she’s a bitchybitch.’; Dunqui used to trav for Yana so if she says Yana is a bitchybitch, then that is trueinf. But Blokka donti care. He does anything to get ahead, and Yana designs for Miley: you canti get higher than that.; ‘?You want the close-ups,’ asked Dunqui, snorting through her darsk. She sent me through a 360vidix of Blokka’s nuwlk. Showy for sure, fokka even… but not tasteful. The long, white feathuzz splayed out from his vadderbase, vurling round his hips. A pulse shuddered his neon-vattooed vaddervanilli every second. As the pulse litup, the neon flashed, staining the feathuzz with pale greens and pinks. Hmm, pressive though.; Spired by Blokka’s turnout, fore I troed to sloze that night, I threaded forty-six thin stentions into a red dyerod and forty-six into a black, darskpeering at them for an hour til the colour was just perfyperfs. Next morning, my slozerlok tipped me exo trestot. I straightened my vressis and tatched the newly-dyed stentions. Added beads, with quiteplicated knotting in coloured threads. Monsright: I stuck a new vapearlie with a mirruv effect, quitedgy. Monsleft: I stamped a grooty vattoo of a mithylephant. I was prettatrav.; That day my first cuzmo was Greenvressis again. ‘These presk florlong vressis are noying,’ he dixed.; ‘You ziring a vringe?’ I sudgered.; We decided on xinches bove the gnangle. I was zlicking into it when he set his voice on hibuzz :‘You know… you said that in a couple of weeks, everyone will have a vadderay?’; ‘Yes,’ I plied, vlatting at the buzz. ‘I bet you it’s trueinf. I have a top fashwerver forming me.’; ‘In less than a year,’ he tinued, quietlon, ‘get this, no one will have a darsk. They’re gonna be soso last year.’; Was he trying to petriff me? His voice was gentle, so I dinti sav, but I felt like I might be being slightlon rassed. Rassed in the trav-place. I tended I hadn’t heard. I dinti say anything. I just rinsed zlicks out of the vringe, and, vailing velochy, vluffed it exo with the smoggastream. I zired him exof my jop immedion.; Later, at homeyhome, during my freshnub dryclenz, I thort bout what he had dixed. I couldn’t help it. It had sown a petriffix in my heart. What had he meant? Can you even take off a darsk? Is it not raw bludders underneath? I have nevah bleppaed one what wasn’t on a darskiddenfront, and I have never bleppaed a darkiddenfront without a darsk. How would a person without a darsk be nected to Mileyhole? Would they just not be nected and how would that even be allowed? It was imposs, and daygolass. The very thort made me feel like I might tubemitt. I felt like I felt when I first got porned onsplay. I membered something horrolob what my old bezzi Tratta once told me. In his trav for the Pleese he had to watch OldNetInf. He said how, on there, litters no one has a darsk, but they troe round parling and meeting chuther yet suffocate their poor vaddervanillis and moufleurs under layers of terial. I asked if that was just mith but he said no, it was realinf.; It’s just horroblon porno. Petriffy. We have to protek chuther from it. You have to be prettapress your fliplarm. Yet in all my months of studying shwervistory, no one evah mentioned OldNet. Most people donti even sav what it is. I have heard of it, but I’m still not sure: maybe Tratta got it wrong and it is just mith. But all what Tratta told me stayed with me and I couldn’t help thorting bout it sometimes. He dinti seem like a person who would parle falsinf.; I can’t magine not having my darsk though. It’s my skintelligence. It’s like magining all the terial and skin being peeled off your foot or your arm. My darsk is my tection, my curity from the morseless spam in this world. Without filters, you’d obvion be instantlon toowhelmed by ads, you’d be screaming in payn, on the flor. No one could handle that. Also, everyone savs that if your darsk comes off, you canti resp. The air got staddered in 2032 with the Big Nukeyflip. It’s all smogga now. We all need sophistokid resping filters. Darsks matically sort out light vels too. When vues become paynfullon bright for your dk-bleppas, the darsk dulls them for you politelon.; Greenvressis had so shaken me up. I wantied clutch onto my darsk with both bluvs. I would feel so ked without it. So sposed. And also like I was being horroblon rude. I can hardlon parle bout porn. I mean, I have heard of darskiddenbleppers being uncovered, upperblepperflair, lowerblepperflair and all, but darskiddenstrils? Reallon? Darskiddenflappers? Is that even possib? I’ve only evah bleppaed glimpses of dk-flappers on spamporn. If they were closed I could almost handle it. !But what if they were open? I think I might faint if I bleppaed a darskiddeneel.; I once caught a xidental spamflash of shiny whitish darskiddenscessors, which made me feel queamish but I’ve nevah, evah bleppaed a darskiddeneel, thank Miley, but Tratta told me on OldNet they’re all over, peeping exof darskiddenflappers, or even sometimes totalexo and waggling around. He even, to my sprise, splained that ‘what Miley did’ was cisely that. I donti believe it but parrently she sposed her darskiddeneel a lot. Too much. It freaped out the crowds, nukeyflipped their thortpacs and caused some kind of volt which led to the Big Festideath. This forced her to think up her trilly creative pollogy, which I donti have to splain, cos litters everyone learns bout it in fashwervistory as it is obvion the most trilly portant thing to have evah happened. But anyway it zarrelion meant everyone suddlion savved who she was, which in turn led to life-hancing darsks and her being lected to run the universe.; Ugh though. !Those flappy darskideneels.

796,33,78,[Timestamp('2015-01-02 00:00:00')],"Emily ran for the phone.; ‘Hi, it’s Ken…from the Football Club. That slot you wanted, yeah? Friday mornings? You can ‘ave it.’; Emily gasped. ‘Really? What…about Saskia? It’s Saskia’s slot, isn’t it?’; There was a pause. ‘Nah, trust me, she don’t need it no more. Twenty five quid. Start tomorrow if you want. Pay at the bar after the class.’; Emily was thrilled. She’d hankered after that slot for years. Crazy Saskia had always nabbed it though. Everyone in town always raved about Saskia’s classes, about how genius they were. Why had she given up the slot, Emily wondered. Oh well, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth. She quickly emailed her pupils.; Emily locked her car, squinting at the sky. Purple clouds scudded over the sun, causing bars of shadow to run over the pitches. Ropes holding a marquee down snapped in the wind. Two girls in stripy leg-warmers were leaning against the wall, chatting. One turned away to stub out a cigarette. The other cackled. Emily caught the words ‘…hated anyone using her space though…’; ‘You teaching Saskia’s class?’ asked the lanky one, holding one foot in her hand.; ‘No,’ said Emily firmly. ‘I’m teaching my own class, but you’re welcome. Ten quid.’; Clutching her mat and blocks, she pushed open the door with her back. The girls followed her in. Emily had a look around. Shiny pale blue lino, faint smell of beer, tall smeary windows looking out on the pitches and marquee. A howling wind in the rafters. One crappy bare bulb. She put her mat down at the front of the room. ‘Hmm…chairs?’ she mused.; The lanky girl pulled open the door to a cupboard. ‘In here,’ she yawned.; Emily pulled at the stack of metal yoga chairs, upsetting a pile of blocks with a yoga book on top. It slid to the floor, front page open. Scrawled at the top was just one word in angry red felt-tip: SASKIA.; As she dragged a couple of chairs out, a rustling in the corner of the room caught her eye. She tried to focus: what was it? She went over to have a look. Just dry leaves and a dust bunny. She made a mental note to ask Ken to clean up better.; The swing doors banged open. Lauren bounded in, black hair pinned into a bun, rosy cheeks. ‘It’s like so windy out there,’ she laughed. She flipped her pink mat onto the floor near the back of the room. Mike bowled in, looking trim and half of his seventy years: ‘Hi there! Morning!’ He unloaded his rucksack near the front.; Light from the sun breaking through clouds suddenly bathed the room, fading just as fast. The shadow lurking amongst the dry leaves scurried across and hid in the folds of Lauren’s blanket.; The doors crashed open. A gust of wind rippled the blinds. Daisy and Yvonne staggered in, giggling, dropping belts and blocks. ‘Sorry, Emily! Got a bit held up.’ Daisy threw her mat on the floor in front of Lauren and got straight into dog pose head down, her red curls brushing the floor. The shadow scuttled from Lauren’s blanket to nestle in Daisy’s locks.; Emily sat on two blocks, palms together, head bowed. Karen crept in, dwarfed by her massive holdall. She put a finger to her lips, widened her eyes at the others. She yanked off her shoes, pulled off her socks, unrolled her mat.; Daisy lifted her head and came out of dog pose to sit on her blocks. The dark shape scurried into her abandoned jumper. Daisy rubbed her upper arms briskly and looked behind her, pursing her lips.; ‘OMMMM,’ chanted Emily quietly.; ‘OMMMM,’ echoed the class.; Emily stood up. The class followed suit. Their teacher stood very still and upright, shoulders back, belly button back to spine.; The shadow shivered across the room from Daisy’s jumper into Karen’s balled socks. Karen shuddered at goose bumps rising around her neck. Emily said ‘Arms out to the sides, stretch into the fingertips, shoulders down.’ She stepped neatly out of her pose, turning her back to adjust the thermostat on the wall. The shadow shot forward, lingered in the creases of Mike’s rucksack and from there caused a little flurry in the pages of Emily’s notebook.; ‘Chilly, isn’t it?’ The teacher smiled a broad, mellow smile. ‘Ok, feet three feet apart, turn your right leg out. Trikanasana. Reach out, rest your hand on your block…left hand on waist…. turn the waist.’; Her sideways head smiled brightly at the class. ‘Standing poses today, ladies….and gentleman,’ she said, winking at Mike. ‘For strength and stamina.’; A metal bucket went clattering across the car park. Shafts of sunlight again moved quickly over the floor. The shadow left the notebook, seeped along a crack in the lino, slipped along the edge of Emily’s mat and ran up her arm.; The teacher stretched into her perfect triangle. Her body was tingling. Her eyes opened wider, forming shiny black pools. The single bare bulb swung above her, casting shadows through the beams. ‘Turn the waist, the waist,’ she spat with sudden scary intensity. ‘Left hand up to the ceiling, stretch it, stretch, more, Lauren, MORE!‘; Daisy wheezed. Yvonne groaned. Lauren’s bun came undone, tumbling black tresses to the floor. Mike’s limbs were shaking. Karen felt a great weakness wash over her.; ‘Block in your right hand. Right hand, Mike! Stretch it forward….place it one foot away from your big toe, now…hop forward with your left foot, lean on your block, left leg up, lift it, lift it, now look up!’ Emily was shrieking, the cords in her neck standing out with the strain.; She propelled them through Adhamukavirasana, Virabadrasana 1, Virabadrasana 2, Salutation to the Sun, with ever-mounting intensity. ‘Knee BACK, don’t forget to BREATHE, and RELAX! RELAX! This is YOGA!‘ she screamed, her eyes popping with fury.; Only the stripy-leg-warmer girls, recognising deep in their souls the psychotic tones of their old teacher, exchanged petrified glances. The rest of the class were transfixed. ‘Now, Savasana,’ breathed Emily at last, with reverence. ‘The Corpse Pose.’ Her eyes shone a glassy silver. ‘Lie down on your mats. Lay yourselves out. Really get into the pose.‘; Although seized by a strange terror, they obeyed. Emily padded about. Lethal threads of dark smoke streamed from her cold fingers into each empty forehead. Her hand stroked their eyes shut.; Emily sat back down. She placed her palms together. A low ‘OMMMM’ reverberated from her throat. There was no echo, just a deathly silence. She slowly raised her head and surveyed the seven bodies lying so still. She gathered up her things and batted her way through the doors, out towards her car.; ‘Oy,’ shouted Ken from the side door. ‘You gotta pay up! And you can’t leave ’em all lyin’ there! Them bloody yoga freaks gotta be outta here by eleven!’; Emily pushed some notes into his hand. ‘What happened to Saskia?’ she asked.; ‘You ‘avin a larf? Doncha know? She died….last week. Ha, you don’t think there’s any other way you’d’ve have got her slot! Or didn’t you know her?!’ He turned away, honking with laughter.",1,1,0.03518951330532212
797,33,79,[Timestamp('2014-12-31 00:00:00')],"A few weeks back I was clearing out an old box of photos and found a lovely one of my old friend Lucy’s mum, Ros, holding Chloe who was a few weeks old. Now don’t get confused: this Lucy is not Mad Lucy of PIP implant fame, but Juicy Lucy, who I knew when I was ‘litrally’ one. Age three, four, five we would play gypsies in her bedroom, with a wagon made from her bed, pulled by dearly-loved motheaten furry Hassan, a camel that Lucy’s dad Ken had brought back from the Far East. Age six, seven, eight we kept about fifteen imaginary horses under her willow tree. Age nine and ten we would make cakes and wash up which I found fearfully novel as at my house we were not allowed to wash up. (I don’t know, ask Gwanny.) Age fifteen and sixteen we would crash college parties. I would get thrown out but she wouldn’t as she like ‘litrally’ was grown-up, having five older sisters to lend her clothes and make-up, lucky thing.; I don’t know how, but I got it together to put this lovely pic of Ros in the post to Lucy as I thought she might like to see a photo of her mum looking so happy, sitting in a deck-chair in the garden. So anyway this led to Lucy saying why don’t we meet up for a drink at the Old Spring? I said, Oh what fun and shall we ask Hermione? Now, Hermione I ‘litrally’ also knew when I was one as I have a picture of us playing on the floor – age one. We have fun later memories of skiving off school to cycle home for cheese on toast.; So I got to the Old Spring first and shotgunned the table by the fire. I had been planning to have one gin and then coke in order to be able to pick up Bash at ten from a dress rehearsal. However, Lucy and Hermes turned up and ordered a whole bottle of red and a double rum and coke respectively. What was one to do? Party-pooper, moi? Mais non! I phoned Fred and he agreed to pick up Bash. Whoop whoop. I got a couple of double gins down my neck and we started making up for lost time. We have four kids apiece so that kept us busy for a while. The far and distant past did too, and our misspent youth! Our friends from school! Oh, my lord, did that ever get us yakking. Lucy’s sister Jo turned up. Her son Barney was playing with his band at the Portland Arms over the road. Were we up for it? Were we ever! Bitches be giggin! Decided we were going to meet every month and we would be called the Old Springs. Then we decided Rusty Old Springs said it all. Then we realised Rusty Old Springs spelt Ros, which was just wonderful.; We staggered over the road, arm in arm. I think at this point I started to show people my new boob but can’t be sure, maybe that was later. I know Hermes was displaying her rather extensive tattoo to all and sundry. We went in and were the oldest people there, no matter! We bopped about enthusiastically none the less and shouted and drank and appreciated the ‘car-crash cabaret’ wot was the band. They are called Binewski Murder. Boomtown 2013 says they are ‘an anarchic musical rabble who spin tales of doom and debauchery to a soundtrack of waltzes, marches, ballads and car-crashes.’ Yes they were that! I am the most massive fan already.; The stunning, impossibly lanky front man, Barney, is on guitar while a girl called Keri oozes stage presence as she harmonises cross-eyed under her fringe and halloween horns, along to a trombone, bass and drums. Timeless or at least ancient, and vaudeville in a manic, modern sort of way. Bits reminded me of the theatrical Bonzo Dog Doodah Band CD that my sweet college friend Keith who died sent me. I think the truth is you probably can’t be a proper fan of the Bonzo Dog DooDah Band and live. Anyway the Binewski Murder sound is kind of infectious, crunching, bouncy and mental. I kept writing things down for the blog as I didn’t want to forget them. Only trouble is, can’t read them now, the handwriting is just appalling! (Even without being drunk my handwriting has gone down the pan. Who writes with a pen any more? Sad truth, like almost nobody.) ( I keep saying ‘like’ to annoy Bashi who like says it all the time.); So we eventually came out onto the street and shouted away wildly at some strangers about life the universe and everything. I think they wrote down some things on my pad but I can’t read what they wrote either. Poor lost words.; Maybe this is the point where I showed everyone my boob. Don’t know. I probably scared people. I think the Beaut is beautiful (and so does Miss Benyon as we know. She is its creator though so mmm a bit biased maybe?), and Fred claims he does, but probably peeps taken unawares recoil somewhat at the sci-fi nature of it all.; I slept on the sofa at my mum’s house. God, do they ever have weird breakfast at that establishment? Porridge with no salt, just mashed banana intilt! Honestly can you imagine? I borrowed a plastic bowl to take back with me and threw up banana-y porridge and tea into it several times along the motorway. Oops. Still, self-induced is OK, much better than chemo.; So, other than having naughty nights aht on the tahn, I have been engaged on new and wondrous creative endeavours. I have been reading a book that I borrowed from the Cancer Centre, called ‘The Tibetan Art of Positive Thinking.’ I only read half a chapter which was about the humungous power of thought waves and I remembered something so fundamental that I can’t believe I had forgotten it. It is that you have to do everything, even picking up pony poos, with LOVE. I knew this before, but sometimes you just forget. You can’t help ligging about, sighing and letting whole days slip by. But now I have remembered: just do everything with a deep and calm feeling of love. Sounds bonkers, I agree, but such a laugh waiting to be had by all, honest. That same day, I brought down all the piles of clothes that had been stagnating, probably for several years, in the corridor, sorted them out, washed them, dried them, loved them, folded them, hung them up. It was a JOY. And no effort. That same day, I came to my computer and just decided on the spur of the moment that I was going to create ‘TITS: the Musical.’ Yes, we will take it to Edinburgh in summer 2013, no time like the present, let’s get this show on the road.; Wicked ideas for songs so far. Far-out instrumentals for the leafy Boob Tube where the women are milked. (I’m thinking Ben Sommers sounds, if he doesn’t mind writing us a few bars. If you are over 18, check out his song Hillary.) Slick salsa (I know Annie and Sexteto Cafe will write me some bars) backed by a frenetic foetal heartbeat for the zumba-crazed anti-mother who induces her baby three weeks early so she can go skiing, contrasting with a chilled spaced vibe backed by a calm da-dum, da-dum heartbeat for the pregnant yoga mums. (Ooh, the lighting person will have fun playing with panicky reds versus cool bluey greens.) Folky jamming or Stomp-like percussion on pots and pans from the stoned crusties running the milk factory. A comedy song when our baddie Tarquin gets it into his head that his girlfriend Francesca is going to have to disguise herself as a lollipop lady in order to spy on the school to find out why the kids are so clever. You can just imagine her upon her zebra crossing, hating the kids, scowling in her lurid yellow coat. We also must have a drinking song (maybe Binewski Murder would write one for us?) for the conman and his cronies in the pub as they study the logistics of them big tits going up the hill and them tiny ones coming down and wonder what the hell is going on.; A comic song of paranoia is required for when Tarquin starts thinking he is being targeted by the Bodily Fluid Terrorists. We need an operatic duet for Booby and Busty when they agree to be poached and go over to the dark side. We need a choral lament to be sung by the women who have defected to the lab from hell. Imagine them wailing with their drips, their chemo, their pallor… and all while their milk is being forcibly extracted. (Such a contrast to our lovely Boob Tube which is productive, expressive, fluid and full of joy.) Tarquin can be at the head of it, conducting the whole nightmare dance. The lighting person will need some scary disco lights for that bit. And then poor betrayed Hetty will burst in on them all and whack out a whole impassioned counter-rhythm throwing it all off-kilter.; The beauty of doing Edinburgh is that it costs so much to hire the theatre for a slot for the week, that people are forced to pare their shows down to an hour. And I mean, I really have got enough material for one hour. We will have to pack it in. And I can’t wait to hand out our leaflets on the Royal Mile. ‘Hmm, TITS: the Musical. What is it about?’; ‘Erm, well, it’s about TITS really!’; ‘What? Just tits?’; ‘Yeah. Just tits.’; I’ve also joined something called Nanowrimo where you write a novel in a month. I thought I might do a full-length version of my new short story which has materialised. Just to give you a laugh, I will paste it here for you. You can see it is also going to be black comedy.; Anyone could make that mistake once, but then he did it again. (That’s the line you have to put in somewhere.); I weren’t having none of it. If you got yerself a noo girl, with lovely big boobs, you don’t go phoning yer snooty old one. He said he deleted her from his phone but he never.; I decided now was the time. I started taking his sperm regular like. Thing is, I needed the money! What you gonna do? If you need the money, you need the money.; I’d run downstairs gagging, spit into me jam-jar, trot over the road to number 14 in me dressing gown and hand it to Pat. Pat would pass over a hundred and fifty quid wivout batting an eye.; Ha, those were the days. Three hundred quid a day to burn. First things first, I booked meself a little ‘holiday’ at the Rivers and came out with an even bigger pair of boobs! I had mojitos in Baroosh almost every day. I took me mates Shelley and Chardonnay shoppin in Harlow. I’d go dancin at the Fountain three times a week. I was a Lady wot Lunches, me! The Crown, the Star, the Boars Head.; Then one of Pat’s clients had twins. OMG, gorjuss or wot. Blond little cherubs they were. Soon as I saw them I knew. They had ‘the lip.’ His lip. Matt’s top lip is kinda….well, different. It’s like muscly. It moves a lot. Like twitches but in a good way? Well, these babies had that same lip, honest to God you could see it. Also, their eyes like gave it away. A blue that’s just so blue I can’t explain. Like a deep blue wiv a flash a purple. Gotta give it to him, he is a lovely man. I wouldn’t be wiv him if he weren’t now, would I? I’m a classy bird, I needed myself a good un.; So Pat says to me, she says ‘I need three lots a day, Eileen.’; I stares at her, like wot? ‘I don’t even know if he can, Pat!’ I say. ‘He already thinks I’m a nympho.’; ‘I’ll give you two hundred a shot,’ she goes, ‘as the posh mums are after it.’; ‘Hunh! Course they are!’ I says to meself. ‘They want pretty babies and they don’t care how they get them.’; Everyone knew that Matt’s spunk made the best babies. There was them snooties wot paid through the nose for his sperm like four and five years back. The little girl is the pride of the pre-prep with her drama prize and the angelic boy got a Waterstone’s poetry award ahh bless im.; Then one of Pat’s ladies, you so will not believe this, only went and had triplets! I know, three of the little buggers. Oh my lord though, you shoulda seen them. From another world they was. Hair so blond it were blinding. Rosy cheeks. Twitchy lips. Flash a purple. Honest to God, everyone wanted a bit of that.; So I started having it off with Matt in the middle of the day as well. I’d pop a vajazzle on, shimmy up to him in my silky dressing gown, take his hands from his computer, run them over my new boobs. I’d lure him into the bedroom.; He probably found it a bit odd that I never stuck around after our little sessions. But men, they just don’t question things do they? Not if they’re getting enough. They don’t argue.; It did make me laugh though just how many of Matt’s sperm-kids was around in our town. I could tell em a mile off. They had a Matt-swagger, that lovely jutting out chin and ready smile. OMG they was all over the place! Blond, almost white hair, but thick, so thick. And always that lip, curlin and strong. A larf and a half. And he didn’t have an effing clue!; I was tickled pink every day thinking about my lovely secret. For a good few years I surfed them profits.; Then, last October the first knock at the door came. A lanky teenager in a puffy Fat-face gilet. Curled his top lip. ‘Does Matthew Lark live here?’ he asked, just like that, cheeky bugger.; I slammed the door in his face.; A month later two girls probably about twelve years old turned up on the doorstep with matching Russian furry hats. Hair like silver straw. Their upper lips flipped upwards to reveal gleaming teeth. ‘We’re wondering…if our dad lives here?’; ‘Not on your life, Nellie,’ I replied, pushing their fingers off the door-jamb.; Three weeks later, just before Christmas, I opened up to a whole horde of crazy blondies. Silent, beseeching eyes fixed on mine, muscly upper lips stretched over them pearly teeth.; ‘Darling?’ Ooh bollocks, it was Matt, behind me. ‘Who are all these people? Are they carol singers?’; The horde’s mouths dropped open as they feasted their eyes upon my husband.; ‘Yeah, they are,’ I lied all firm like. ‘Carol singers. Go on! Sing then!’ I urged them. (‘You little bastards,’ I added under my breath.); The horde opened their perfect lips spookily as one: ‘Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us…’",1,1,0.099242433461366
804,33,85,[Timestamp('2015-03-09 00:00:00')],"I arrived home from hospital to an email telling me that the Breast Blog in the World is in the top 23 breast blogs of 2012 on the american website Healthline. I am honoured and chuffed. The best thing about it, for me, has been discovering the other 22 bloggers. They are clever, energetic, inspiring and varied. Some are anti-pink ribbon activists. They think a lot too much is spent on ‘raising awareness’ when funds should be pouring into research. Some are very sad. More than one of the blogs link to another activist blogger, Rachel’s site. Read her blog and you will want so much to meet her, but you can’t. She did not survive metastatic breast cancer and died at 41, just last February.; This is probably why so many writers choose not to be as jokey jokey as me. Seeking out any scraps of fun cancer may afford (on a good day) does not help eradicate the bastard. The truth is there, staring us in the face, unless we maintain seriously impenetrable filters. But then, sometimes I think, ‘for want of a joke, the reader was lost.’ Many readers get compassion fatigue. They just can’t take in too much seriousness or pain and end up zoning out.; Another come-down: Dennis is ill. He has a chest infection. The antibiotics he has been given are not making any difference. I hope the massive task of taking away my sin has not destabilised him. He is such a giver; it must be very draining. I have been typing up his book as fast as I can, as it will make him better to see his book in print. Tonight the whole family is going to type taking it in turns.; So I have been reminding myself that my post-op euphoria is all very well, but not very clevs. When things are going well, it is wise to regroup your armies, not let down your guard. Not go and behave drunkenly and stupidly like wot I am tempted to. Not break into that pack of medicinal marijuana someone popped in….;-); So, practicalities. I am not allowed to lift anything (as this can exacerbate a lifelong condition called Lymphoedema which you get from having missing lymph nodes.) This leads to frustrating situations where, from my chair, I am trying to direct others to do what I would normally do. We were in the garden. Fattipuss turned up with a frog. A beautiful fat frog. ‘Quick, Fred, save it! Save it! Fattipuss will bite off its legs,’ I yelled, of course.; Fred is so laid-back that, to me in hyper-loon mode, he appears vexingly slow. I would have shot over there and had the frog free within around seven seconds. It took Fred seven seconds to realise that I had spoken to him. He looked up from his crossword.; ‘Fred! Please, please, save the frog, the frog!’ I screamed.; Fred finished his clue, sighed and meandered over there. He crouched down and watched Fattipuss with the frog.; The parrots strutted outo their outside cage to watch proceedings. ‘Puss, puss, puss!’ called Kiki.; ‘Take the cat away!’ I yelled. ‘Pick the cat up! Put him in the kitchen so he can’t get out!’; Eventually Fred put the cat in the kitchen, failing to shut the other door, so Fattipuss came straight out again. I gave up on Fred.; ‘Alfie!’ I yelled. ‘Alfie, please come and shut the cat in the kitchen!’; ‘Wot?’ asked Torro. ‘Wot?’; Alfie turned up all sleepy and duh-looking. He picked up the cat and put him in the kitchen. He forgot to shut the other door. The cat came straight out again.; ‘Alfie!’ called Torro. He has a way of predicting people’s lines.; ‘Alfie! The cat got out! Put the cat away again! Shut both doors this time! Duh!’; Alfie took the cat away again. Five seconds later, out came Fattipuss, heading towards the frog. Honestly, you couldn’t make it up.; I was by this time hopping with frustration. You cannot control these people. They are too mellow for their own good. Fred was laughing and saying ‘That cat is so clever.’; ‘He’s not clever! He came out of an open door three times! It’s you wot is mentally challenged. Aaargh, he’s going to get the frog!’; ‘Nah, he’s forgotten all about the frog, he’s not going to bother with the frog.’ Fred picked up his crossword.; ‘Of course he will! I know about cats: they never give up!’; Alfie said dismissively ‘Relax mandem! He’s bored of the frog. No way will he go after the frog.’; Fattipuss sprinted at the frog. The frog did a massive leap. They both went into the bushes.; ‘Was I right? Say that I was right! I am always right! Say I am always right!’; ‘I am always right,’ said Fred.; Puerile.; Went to Gin Club in Claire’s garden with the blokes. They all want to meet Miss Benyon but I have entered a possessive phase. ‘No, you can’t, she’s mine.’ LOL. Mad Lucy and I have decided to have a splinter gin group for ‘people with implants.’ He he. We will have our own mutual fakey boob admiration meetings.; One of the bladdicts wants to know the story of how we got the parrots. OK, if you bear with me I will reward you at the bottom with pictures of ‘Tabby escaping from the asylum’ and ‘Tabby having a hypo’.; Naughty. You are not meant to scroll down when I tell you things like that. You have to earn your Tabby pictures. Soon they will cost money.; Anyway…..it was Alfie’s seventh birthday coming up. He had said that he would really love a budgie, so I popped along to Thorley pet shop. They had budgies for £7.50 but they only had small cages and I was determined to get a big fuck-off cage so our budgie would be very happy. The Thorley people sent me to PetWorld in Harlow. There they had budgies but again, the cages were not big enough. They suggested BirdWorld on the M25. Off I went.; I entered the enormous warehouse and told some chap I was looking for a budgie. He’d obviously seen me coming a mile off.; ‘What you want a budgie for?’ the man said. He took a three month old African Grey parrot out of its cage and said ‘Put your hand out.’; The bird blinked sleepily at me and stepped slowly onto my hand. His claws were warm and soft. His feathers were fluffy. I was entranced. He was just so sweet. I had what I would now recognise as a Miss Benyon moment.; ‘Reared him from an egg, I did,’ the chap said. ‘You won’t find a better bird.’; ‘Look, I just can’t,’ I protested weakly. ‘We have dogs who will rip him apart.’; ‘Uh uh.’ The chap shook his head. ‘Look at this beak. No dog will go for a bird with a beak like this. Some of my customers’ birds ride the dog round the house.’; ‘Do you have a big cage?’; He showed me the most enormous cages.; ‘How much is he?’ I really thought he was going to say like thirty five quid or something.; ‘Seven hundred quid. They do live for a hundred years though.’; You would think that I would have laughed at that point and walked away, but no. I phoned my neighbour and friend Meg who was about 85 at the time. (She is now 91!) ‘Oh wonderful!’ she exclaimed. ‘I had an African Grey as a child. They’re the cleverest, most entertaining birds of all. Ours was called Torro. Such a character. And no trouble.’; Then I phoned Fred. ‘I’ve found the most beautiful parrot, Fred. Only thing is, he’s seven hundred quid.’; Slight pause. ‘Yeah, alright, why not?’ said Fred.; Sigh. In those days, we had money….but no sense! Should have thought about saving up that seven hundred quid for Berklee College of Music. Still, at least I asked him so he could never say it was my fault.; So that is how Torro came to live at our house. He was happy but looked a bit lonely so few months later it was Fred’s birthday and the kids and I went back to BirdWorld and found Kiki. We put them in together and within minutes they were kissing. Aaah bleeesss. Barney came round and knocked up a really big cage in our kitchen. A few weeks later we said we wished the parrots could go outside. Barney just went outside, bashed the wall with a hammer, took out three bricks and built a cage on the outside of the wall as well. So the parrots have been going in and out as they like for seven years now.; So now you deserve your reward: a couple more gems for you from Tabby’s library of acting. Tabby has a bunch of fwends who we call her Stiletto Fwends. This is because they turn up in a big gaggle, navigate the paving stones and gravel in their stilettos, put on piles of makeup and false lashes and wobble off into town shrieking and laughing. One of the Stiletto Fwends is Alex, the daughter of my fwend Caz/Patsy. Alex took this photo of Tabby. It is called ‘Escape from the Asylum.’; This one is also taken by Alex. Thanks Alex! It is called ‘Tabby having a Hypo and Alex just loving the excuse to eat Wotsits in the middle of the night.’ Don’t know about you, but they both make me piss myself.",1,1,0.14051532827930535
805,33,86,[Timestamp('2015-01-02 00:00:00')],"I am back home now, still high as a kite, but wrote this while I was still in hospital:; I am now feeling pretty much 100%. Have been for a walk and sat outside in mild sunshine and breeze. My roomies looked at me as if I had been to another planet when I got back. Poor Susan feasts her eyes on me. She needs to turn the corner. I am giving her encouragement.; Most of the nurses seem confident I will be released tomorrow. I just don’t have an invalid mentality. Today, being fully dressed, I really don’t fit in. Another drain came out. They think both the others should come out tomorrow or I will go home with one. Shanelle’s Mum, who is called Laura, (she says I can tell you), says her drains were full of skanky slop. She has a bit of a way with words. She is on Twitter, it’s Bubbalicious80.; Monday; I can go home! Both drains were taken out this morning. The nurse tells you to take deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth, so you know it’s not going to feel great. You soon find out that it feels as if a long turgid panicking maggot is tunnelling its snout through your body. I looked at the retrieved drain. Quite a length, like 15 cm, had been inside me. (sounds rude!) I asked the nurse if the tube suctions the skanky slop up just from its end. She said no, the tube has lots of little holes, so the slop is slurped up from all along its length (sounds even ruder!); Spent the night watching the Olympic Closing Ceremony. Steve, one of the nurses, had said to call him when the Spice Girls came on. As soon as they started popping out of their lit-up cabs I skidded out into the corridor and hissed ‘Spice Girls!’ The nurses came running, and we turned my TV round, took out the headphones, let the sound out and had a quiet, illicit boogie.; I and ‘The Beaut’ (my new boob) are now home. Always strange exiting sterility into earth, muddy pawprints, rampant vegetation. The dogs were out at the farrier with Chloe when I got home. We sat at the table to have a cuppa and Debbie and BB came by with a fabulous lemon cake which we ate there and then. The dogs got back and galloped down the big room to leap onto my sofa. Then Norwich Phil dropped by for a cuppa as she’d been to Stansted, and Barney came in and had sups with us, wot Tabby made. Told him about Miss Benyon-sigh-with-admiration-and-joy. He says everyone falls in love with their surgeon. It’s classic and to do with the morphine or the fact you’re totally in their hands or something. (Claire looked it up for me. She says it’s called Nightingale Syndrome after Florence.) I won’t tell you what Chloe then said, but it meant did I want to have sex with her (in much cruder terms which I will not detail as Bashi and Alfie’s mates read the blog). I was like ‘No, Chloe,’ shocked, ‘this is a purely platonic love. Admiration and joy.’ Fred doesn’t mind. He fancies her too. The whole world does. If you met her you would understand. The gin group are all gagging to meet her. I said they should book a tit enlargement or something.; BTW, please don’t tell Miss Benyon-sigh-with-admiration-and-joy that the world is in love with her. I would not tell you about it if I did not feel fairly sure that she is way too busy wielding her skilful scalpel to check out patients’ blogs.; I am FB fwends with Laura (Shanelle and Chelsea’s mum.) She is very naughty and gets on a negative bent. She posts things like ‘No college, no money, only pain.’ I have reminded her to think of the things she does have, like her gorgeous girls, her cat mctubbyfluffybumbum or whatever he’s called, and her house (I’m assuming she has one and does not live in a ditch.) Then I told her I had encased her in pink cottonwool and was asking the universal energy to help her. Dennis told me how to do this. Do you know what? She slept like a baby and now thinks I’m her angel! Today she posted ‘I am not well, I need Shanelle.’ What a great poem! I can tell the force is now with her.; Bashi has changed over the last couple of weeks. She has become scholarly. This is because I took away her computer. Her reliance on it had been bugging me. She has made a map of Greece on her wall and is sticking arrows on it to the places where things happened to Odysseus and other ancient peeps. She is also making family trees of the Greek Gods and heroes. This is complicated as the gods often bonked mortals and messed it all up.; This just goes to show that if screens disappear from children’s lives, creative things start to fill the time. I have long believed this, and used to throw away the TV rather randomly as the fancy took me when they were little. We had so much more fun without it. Our favourite game was sweetie shop. We would buy sweets from a shop, come home with them and set up our own shop. We would make little signs that said ‘1p’, ‘2p’, ‘5p’ and ’10p’, find lots of coins and paper bags, and go shopping. We would take it in turns to be the shopkeeper. Ahhh. Happy days. I actually feel like I want to play that game now but with Old Jamaica, After Eights, Green and Blacks Organic Neapolitans, fifty ps and pound coins. (Fred says these goodies sound like different types of grass. You can tell he grew up on a council estate.); Alfie would make a massive fuss whenever I got rid of the telly but within minutes he would recover and start to make up for lost time. When he was five he was reading the Biff and Chip books at school along with the rest of the UK, and embarked upon an ambitious project to create a reading scheme of his own. He actually managed this, writing thirty one books. He peaked a bit early really and has not done much since to impress apart from ‘beasting’ COD (Call of Duty, a playstation game for those who don’t know about these horrors). He got four detentions in one week the other day. The process apparently went like this: ‘Alfie, you have not brought your calculator with you: you will have a detention.’; ‘Nah bruv, my mum like washed my blazer and stuff….’; ‘Alfie, you will have another detention for answering back.’; ‘Wot you chattin mate? You can’t do that, innit…’; ‘Alfie, stop talking or I’ll give you another detention.’; ‘Nah mate, you’re shittin me, you can’t give me detentions for arguing my case, we live in a democracy, you know I is right bruv,’ and so on.; Honestly, the poor teachers. I have remembered a story from Redland School in Bristol. We had an RE teacher, Miss Colliver, who had a bit of theatrical spirit in her. The very first lesson she planted herself firmly at the front of the class of eleven-year-olds, holding a Bible aloft, and declaimed: ‘This is not a book.’; Us kids gazed at her a bit blankly and thought her a bit odd frankly. (Hey Laura, I can do poems too innit?) We all were made to hazard guesses as to what it was if it was not a book. All of our answers, however clever, (and we did have a few good ones) were wrong. By the end of the lesson, we had learnt that the Bible is not just one book, but lots of books. At least this annoying method meant I never forgot this. Of course, seeing as we never had a telly and did actually communicate with each other as a family, I related this to my sister Penel, who, it turned out, had quite a retentive memory. Two years later she walked into her first class with Miss Colliver.; ‘This is not a book!’ announced Miss Colliver.; There was hardly time for this bold statement to reverberate around the room before Penel shattered the peace with: ‘No, it’s LOTS of books!’ The teacher choked and spluttered in distress. Her entire method had been belittled. I bet Penel is repentant now, being a teacher herself. For some reason my brother Pete absolutely loves this story, and can do it with voices and everything, even now, and for Penel using a squeaky little Donald Duck voice.; But anyway, a decade ago, when Alfie was five, he could hardly wield a pen or spell, but this did not stop him focusing on his work. The back of ‘the horible giant’, which is thirty two pages long, has a picture of a small rather ill-looking owl and says:; Stage six OWlS Stage severn; the bonfire the teacher; the pig the bully; balincing the horible giant; pictuese a fite; the robber; the chinies vase; the flower pot; (I have helped you in case you are not yet on Stage 7 and thus find the original hard to read.); It’s a dim photo because we can’t find the camera charger so had to use the mac. Will show some of the ‘pictuese’ when we find it. You will love the very phallic ‘a fite’ which is full of ‘bow-ran-arrose’ and ‘souds’ and ‘speayears’. Basically goodies kill ‘badies’ and badies kill goodies and then ‘light tin comes and rain comes.’ You turn the last page and it says ‘And the sky biagan to turn red.’; Nighty night from happyland.",1,1,0.08137631567778623
807,33,88,[Timestamp('2015-03-24 00:00:00')],"Well, Grampa has brought in a laptop for me to tell all. It might be easier to talk you through it day by day as so much has happened I might get confused.; Mad Lucy dropped in during the day on Monday to give me some witchy talisman crystal thing. She has never let it out of her sight before so I am honoured. She asked me ever so seriously if I had said goodbye to my nipple. ‘Yes, of course‘ I answered, confidently. Later I had a bit of a panic because I realised that was not true. I had not really said goodbye to it. Still haven’t. Oops. Too late.; All that day I received phone calls, texts and messages on the blog and on facebook. I realised that the burden really has been shared. My friends and family and blog readers have been shouldering little chunks of the worry for me.; That evening, I went to Lorna’s yoga, which is not for the faint-hearted. She is like a Sergeant Major and she really really cares more than her life that you do the poses right. We did Tadasana and Trikonasana and Gotagreatbigarsana. In Trikonasana I felt strength coursing through my arms, shoulders, back. In the Warrior pose I thought of my warrior and really tried very hard to keep my knee back and the back foot pinned down and my trunk straight and my arm shooting out in front strong. I looked out over the arm and saw vistas unfolding before me. We did downward dogs, upward dogs, Uttanasanas, where you hang forward and powerful back-bends over a chair. This was like a last supper for my lymph nodes.; After all that I was so buzzing I thought I’d never be able to sleep but conked out no problem.; On the way to the hospital I impressed upon Chloe and Fred the importance of buying the green sack of dog food for Huggi from the pet shop. ‘Please, if you only do one thing, do this,’ I begged. Fred dropped Chloe and me off at five to seven am. The pre-op people filled in forms and asked me questions. One of them was ‘Have you had any Mad Cow disease in your family?’ That made us roar with laughter, it was so random yet so apt. We are all Mad Cows.; Miss Benyon turned up all smiles and with undisguised glee drew on my back and front with her black pen. I was glad that Chloe could meet her and see what an ace person she is.; I lay down on a bed, with my stretchy stockings on, a hospital gown and a stretchy tube on my head. Many green-clad people milled about calmly. They put a line in my arm and said ‘We’re going to put something in that will make you a little drowsy, OK?’; Then they were saying ‘You can wake up now,’ and honestly it was just like Mad Lucy said, ping, I was awake and alert as anything, and the five-hour op had been done. I just could not believe it. Lying in recovery was bliss. The morphine was making me deeply relaxed and ecstatic. Then they wheeled the bed to ward M5. Along the way the scenery changed like with camera angles on the telly. It was quite a bumpy ride but enjoyable. I was wheeled into a room and Fred was there straight away. He held my hand. I could only whisper, so he whispered too. He tells me now that I kept forgetting what I had just said but I was under the impression I was making perfect sense. Miss Benyon popped in and told us all had gone well. She said that my insides had been quite sticky but that is caused by the chemo and they are used to it.; I was bowled over by my private room, the wonderful view of poplars out of the window and the gentle hands of nurses making me comfortable. Fred got to see the boob and said it looked great. I told Fred what to write for the blog.; That night, nurses came in every hour, checking the boob was warm and pink. They checked the drains and catheter, took my blood-pressure, temperature and pulse, reassured me, checked the pain-relief and antibiotics in the drip. Teams of them worked hard all night to help me. I was impressed and grateful. In the morning a lovely nurse sponged me and put my feet in a tub of warm water. She helped me out of bed to a chair with infinite tenderness.; That day, Miss Benyon popped by again. She is my absolute Top Woman now. Honestly, you should see her. She is beautiful, funny, extremely talented and has a wicked throaty laugh. OMG so many people must be in love with her. I can’t believe my luck that I had her doing the job. It does make me wish I had really engaged my brain, tried harder in Science lessons and maybe had a massive career helping people the way she has. She told me I had a great muscle on the back with which to rebuild. This made me glad of all the yoga and heaving hay bales over the fence wot I done.; Miss Benyon showed me the boob. It is beautiful. Honestly, anyone would be impressed. The skin is all still there, apart from the nipple, which is now a circle of skin from my back. The circular scar is covered very neatly with white gauze, which is covered with a highly advanced kind of cling-film. My whole chest is covered with thick padded gauze to keep it warm. The new breast is younger-looking and a bit higher than the other one, but will apparently drop to match the other more droopy side. (I did breastfeed my babies for ten years remember.) The very best thing about the new boob is that it has NO CANCER in it. She told me that Mr Farouhi managed to scrape everything out, and took out all the lymph nodes from under my arm. She said my insides look so good I will probably live for a long time, much longer than the feared five years. Phew.; She said I could have the catheter out first thing the next morning. It was quite nice not having to bother with going to the loo tbh. She also said that I am doing so well that I might crash, like start weeping and wailing with exhaustion, but then she doesn’t know about all you guys sharing the burden and Dennis talking to the angels for me and Claire and her six children doing the rosary for me (even newborn Aggie I’ll bet!) and all the prayer groups praying for me and my mum and dad wringing their hands for me.; So. I am a plastic surgery convert. Who’d have thought it?; I phoned Claire and told her I wanted her to visit me. She asked what she should bring. I said trashy magazines and Viz. She admired my new boob and reckoned the others would be well jells that she’s seen it first. She also admired my room with a view. It is enormous and very clean. We are massively impressed with the NHS. Fred brought me Private Eye and got my telly working. Really funny, he bumped into Fred’s sister’s bloke Graham down in the Concourse. He is a drug-runner for the hospital. He came up to see me too.; The next day, Mr Farouhi came to see me. I was absolutely delighted to see him as he is my new hero. ‘Just a social call really,’ he said with his wonderful smile. ‘I know you are doing well.‘ He told me that the tissue they took out and the nodes looked really good, healthy, not sinister.; ‘Does that mean that the cancer is less likely to have spread elsewhere?’ I asked.; ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘And it means that the chemo did its job well.’; I thanked him again and again.; You know, my friend Cecile told me that she experienced no pain after her op, and I really did not believe her. I thought she must have forgotten, blotted it out. But now I can sincerely say, like her: I have not had even a moment of pain. The first night and day I had a morphine dispenser in my hand. Did get a bit trigger happy yes. It’s so lush though, you can see how people get addicted. Yesterday I was only on Paracetamol, and last night only on Ibuprofen. Today I had two Paracetamol and feel fine.; So, the rest of I practised walking about as the physio told me to and did arm exercises. Bash, Alfie, Big Alf and Fred came to visit. This reminds me of a time I phoned the College to see if I could get tickets for their Science Cafe thing. The man on the phone said ‘Give me the names of the people who want to come and I will let them in.’; I said, ‘Well,’ pause, ‘it’s Alf Tingey, Alf Tingey and Alf Tingey.’; The bloke thought I was avin a larf. But Fred is Alfred really, actually Alfred Frederick, which I’m sure is quite unusual. But then his mother Irene was quite unusual. I am sure she is an angel now. And Big Alf has called his new boat Irene Jean after her.; So Alfie lay on the groovy hospital bed and watched the little bikes whizzing over the mounds and people smashing their faces in. Bash told me all about how Fred had forgotten to buy the green food for Huggi so he had squitted everywhere and howled the neighbourhood down. *sigh*; I showed them the drain tubes. I explained (and will now explain for the benefit of Alfie and Bashi’s fwends who, I am told, read the blog) that they gently suck out the gunk and stuff from the wounds. I told them my catheter had gone. I explained that it is a tube which goes into your bladder and sucks out the wee so you don’t have to get up. The end of it inflates to keep it in. When they take it out they deflate it. Luckily, or it would hurt like crap. I think it’s good for kids to be acquainted with hospitals and to know that they exist. They were pretty impressed with my fabby room. We looked out over fields of harvested wheat. We talked about the word harvest. See, Miss Benyon had said she could ‘harvest’ the flesh from my back. The word gives me shivers ever since reading Never Let Me Go, the book about the clones. They only exist in order to provide organs for their Real People in the outside world. It turned out that from GCSE biology Alfie actually knows quite a lot about cloning and how you do it. I was impressed. I told him maybe he could have a career in cloning and on the side create little armies of Alfie Tingeys. Bash groaned at the very thought.; Later my mum and dad came. They were relieved to see me so happy and well as they have been ‘soo worried.’ After that, Dennis came. He gave me healing. It was again unbelievably good. I felt suddenly at one point as if I could let go of that small but ever-tugging feeling that I am a bad person, that I don’t deserve my lovely Fred, my happy life, my lovely children. I think Dennis was pulling away my original sin. I remembered a time when I was about nine, with my sister, when we went to the playing fields on Granchester Road and we found in the hedge a tiny den, with little seats, a rug, a shelf with cups of pencils, notepads, poems, candles. It was so lovely that we were jealous and angry that it was not ours. Do you know what we did? We scribbled ‘UGH!!’, ‘STUPID’, ‘RUBBISH’ all over the poems, we snapped the pencils, we trashed the place. I am now (and have been for years) sincerely sorry for this. Anyway, Dennis took it all away. I slept the deep sleep of the sinless.; Och, Granny has to take the laptop off noo, so I will save the rest for another installment. Sorry I have not had time to tweak. Raw stuff. See you soon!",1,1,0.1888720130178463
809,33,9,[Timestamp('2015-12-29 00:00:00')],"My tretcher turned itself off. My slozerlok opened and tipped til I was standing. I climbed out and peered through my darsk into the mirruv. That moufleur needs a bit of teeyelsee, Kedda, I said to myself. Got in the blowpac for a freshnub dryclenz.; Fitted my lights first, as it’s hard getting them in evenly once the flair’s furled. Then I velochy vlomed and set the vressis into hard spiralling spikes. I don’t have long vressis. One needs to look bislisslike. I alternated a dark grey with a shiny vlu. My lights are simple white. I donti troobi being too flashy. You donti wanti upstage the cuzmos.; No time to tube anything, so I lokapped the partmo and, comdab, took the boo to vail. Two stops only. I’m lucky to live in the sentralzo, where all the trilly fashwerve houses are.; Got to the jop by eight. My first cuzmo was a man ziring a new varector. I montred him our new springy terial. It keeps your vaddervanilli as upright as you troobi, but you can obvion adjust cording to the fashwerve, which changes so fast that this is a portent sideration. Two weeks ago it was bangup to have your vanilli ponting slightly down. Who would have dixed it? Vanillis had always been ponting up til then. But there’s no accounting for fashwerve. This week one is only bangup if they are a ninety degree man.; Then I stood guard over the splays for an hour, pressing spambort. Someone has to, obvion, but why me? Talika often gives me crap travs. It noys me as I am fokka at design and shouldn’t have to waste my talent. One of the timps should do it.; I had a break. I rested on the bench exo. I darskchecked my ins, nothing much, mostly spam.; I vaxed and trimmed a vlady’s moufleur. She didn’t need stentions with her twenty centimetres of flair. I swinefully snipped off her bells, then showed her the dyes. She troobied a darkish pink, almost an urple, and a shiny silver, for vertical stripes. Stripes have been coming back in and why not? Reretro and striking. I tied the tiny bells back on again. They made a plezza tinkly noise as they clattened on chuther. She preciated my ferts.; Talika passed a vlady onto me for advice on her flappyflappy vlips. I had a look. The vlips were unusually large and loose, but were quite fokka in their own way. I said, ‘You know, they’re quite riginal. I wouldn’t wuzzo.’; ‘Oh, no,’ she mitted a deep darskamped sigh. ‘They’re too zarre. It’s darskturning. People are stoggaing in the street to darskoo.’; ‘Well, you could use vlitox or get them glued; I have some exslish glue. Or, obvion, as a last zort, there’s vergery.’; She went for vlitox. She’d had glue before on her rimeum. It hadn’t lasted and the whole idea of vergery made her want to tubemitt.; For lunch I tubed a berrycoction. Set my timer for teninnits so I could still stroll round the block. I saw Katoline in the street. You can tell Katoline from a long way off from the mess what is her moufleur. Her vressis were tousled, not in a fokka way, and the colour had gone. ‘Come in for some product,’ I said. ‘Sort out those vressis.’; ‘Not got no likes, Kedda,’ she plied. ‘Need to be paid. Maybe next week.’; ‘?How’s trav,’ I asked.; ‘Hard.’; Katoline manages fifty dells. They trav to hectic deadlines, often being called out with litters teninnits warning.; ‘?You had a coction,’ she asked.; ‘Yeah, had it,’ I said. ‘Might get a choca though.’; ‘Mozapan I’ll send you in three of our fleurs for vampoo-up-vlomb.’; ‘?Vressis,’ I asked.; ‘Not that long. Xinchis.’; ‘Send them early or I won’t have time.’; ‘?Share a vlatticube at the kend,’ she asked.; ‘Sure,’ I plied. ‘Despo for a fokka vlatt.’; I sferred ten likes to Liza at the corner jop for a chocacoction. She’s still got that big vinehous scuring her vlips. Not sicca. I should tell her.; Dronged back, tubed my chocacoction velochy, and started trav again. A girl of sixteen wanting vattoos. She sent an ix through to my darsk. Arbrus, flars. ‘Don’t want stamps though, zire a riginal,’ she said.; ‘No problet,’ I said, jected her with killapayn and started darsketching. Lucklon for her, I am fokka at vart. Some salons donti have a cluebo in hellion.; While she tubed her bloffee I sent her through some quixes. She pulled out her tube, and like snorted through her darsk. ‘?What the blonk,’ she cried. ‘?Have you nevah seen an arbru.’; ‘Course I have.’; ‘A real one I mean.’; ‘?Real.’ I thought ont. ‘No, obvion not a real one. Only ixes.’; ‘Yeh, well, that’s obvion. ?You never been exo.’; ‘Course. I go exo every day,’ I torted.; ‘Exo-exo,’ she said. ‘Properion exo.’; ‘No. I’m…too busy.’ It’s trueinf. I am busy. Exo-exo is far, and ricoloso, so I don’t wanti go there anyway.; She lay back down to darsketch what she troobied. Really good ixes of arbrus.; ‘OK, no problet,’ I said. We must never answer back. You just have to do your best to get the likes off of cuzmos.; ‘?Where you zire thix,’ I asked.; ‘Whorledges,’ she dixed, ‘and monsright.’; The vlady’s moufleur was alpretta quitablowed in vattoos. I pulled her left leg xinchis to the left and her right leg xinshis to the right.; ‘?You want the arbrus on top of the dolfins,’ I asked.; ‘Yes, just go over them. I’m tellment over dolfins.’; I started to vattoo her ix. She screamed a bit, but it were fake. You can’t feel anything on killapayn. It nums you totally. She thought she was feeling payn, but she was just feeling presha.; She troobied the zults though, sferred me some likes, and troed off.",1,1,0.055118817814130305
814,33,94,[Timestamp('2015-01-02 00:00:00')],"Well. Gosh. Such a lot has gone on. Can’t even tell you.; So sorry I haven’t blogged. I have been too happy. When you are this happy it is hard to blog because blogging is kind of about the ego, and when you are happy you are outward-looking and can’t be bothered with all that self-centred crap.; The sofa/quilt/fire/nausea plan never worked out. I just didn’t need it. The Monday I went for Chemo. The very next day I went for more Healing. Healing has now been afforded a Capital Letter in my world. You will see why.; The thing is, people will say, ‘oh, yeah, well, she had a downer, thought she was gonna die, had a crisis, found religion, blah de blah, what could be more obvious….’; Well, I don’t care about what people say. I won’t deny what has happened to me, and it is kind of phenomenal.; The Healing on the Tuesday was wonderful. I felt very peaceful and protected. Near the end of the session I felt as if something in me or around me was being gently tugged, pulled towards the area diagonally away from my left foot. I had my eyes shut, so I could not see what Dennis was doing. The feeling became stronger, like a silent hoover, tugging, tugging, but a good one, a Miele. It was almost too powerful. I nearly sat up to say, ‘Hey, that’s too strong.’ Afterwards, I asked Dennis what he had been doing over there. ‘I pull the things that have hurt you away, the negative, sad things, and direct them into the earth,’ he said. ‘I let them go into the earth and be cleaned. Then I replace the energy with clean, good energy.’; I sang all the way home again. I felt light, strong, alert, full of cheer.; Since then, I have experienced no symptoms from the FEC. No nausea, no weakness, no depression, nothing. I have done lessons, ponies, dogs, RDA, cooking, shopping, everything. The quilts and sofas did not get a look-in. I only used them for watching the football, to which I am newly addicted. I love watching Greece play. They are so Greek. So anarchic and wild against the clinical Russians. And so disproportionately happy when they win, in contrast to the cautious and self-critical English. I love annoying Alfie by doing a running commentary like this: ‘Ooh, he’s lovely isn’t he? Gorgeous! What a big Swede. Mmm. Ooh, why do they pull each other’s shirts like that? It shouldn’t be allowed….That little squitty one has a nice face…why’s that one wearing bright pink boots? looks daft…Oh, GO ON, SHOOOOT, GO ON! NOOOO TOSSER!’ and suchlike.; Every day I have been having horse therapy:; On Sunday I had a phonecall. Marina along the road said that Claire wanted to see me. Claire is her mother who is quite elderly and brought up her four children in this house fifty or so years ago. I went along and had a good chat with her. She seemed in fine fettle. You know, she was the youngest of nine siblings. I know all their names. Sadly all her siblings have died. Told her about Healing. She would like to be healed too. I said I would ask Dennis if he can come to her house.; At RDA on Monday they were short of helpers so Chloe came with me. She came downstairs dressed in these multicoloured dungarees, green wellies and developing dreadlocks. I said, ‘Wow, are you really going dressed like that?’; ‘I thought this was very normal,’ she replied, a bit crestfallen. ‘Isn’t it?’; ‘Mmm not really,’ I said, but let it go, seeing as her other look is ravaged pop-star which would not work well at the riding school. The little boy on the pony she was leading could not speak, but he could laugh. He kept pointing at Chloe’s trousers and laughing. He would then point at her hair and laugh. At the end Chloe said ‘Pat the pony.’ He patted the pony, then Chloe patted him, and he patted her. We all patted each other. He pointed at her trousers some more laughing all the while. He had brought some apple and kept signing that he wanted to give the apple to the pony. We explained that if you keep giving them apple they start biting people who do not give them apple. He still wanted to give the pony the apple. He was allowed to put the apple on the ground for the pony. For someone who could not speak he was incredibly communicative.; Claire and little Agnes came for flute. I loved the baby while her mummy played Debussy’s L’Apres-midi d’un Faune and Bach. Agnes’ little features are imprinted on my mind now. If I shut my eyes I can see them. The baby loves Debussy but does not like Beethoven’s Eroica: too spiky and sharp.; I have been popping in at Mattie’s house as she has her first flute exam on Friday. She has to do some pieces off by heart. ‘You can use the music just once if you like, to remind you how they go,’ I said.; ‘No, Hester. I like a challenge,’ she replied. Yeah, it really will be a challenge if you can’t remember how they go, Mattie! However, I like to let my pupils develop their own methods. If that involves making up the pieces, so be it. God help the examiner, lol. He’s in for a treat. She’ll probably stop halfway through a piece to tell him all about her school play and her friends and what parts they are and how she got the part of the dog.; So a week bowled by, with lovely windy weather, Bloody Marys out in the garden with Fred and Barney, and Tabby going off to Italy to be a drama teacher. It is her very very sweet Italian teacher Michaela who invited her to go. If you ever want a big laugh, ask Tabby to do her Michaela impression. It is so funny honestly, it makes you die. She has a very deep voice and really draws out each syllable: ‘Taaaaaaaaa-byyyyyyyyyyyyyy….’; Anyway, so Tuesday came around again and it was time for more Healing. At the Chemo I had bumped into a friend from my yoga class, Martha. She is a really pretty, little person. She was at Oncology for a follow-up appointment, having had her operation and radiotherapy a few months back. She said she was terrified to see the doctors, that they would say it had come back. Her face was not like I knew it; she looked afraid.; ‘You need to come for Healing!’ I told her.; So Martha picked me up and we went together. I had booked her a meeting with Dennis. I read the books in the library while she was in there. She came out emotional but beaming.; I went in. I lay down on the table and shut my eyes. Dennis set to work. Instant visuals started up. I got a black spot which started small and grew to engulf a lighter spot within it, which grew again to engulf again, lovely. Fred has told me that visuals are a tempting distraction from the real business of getting down to serious meditation, so I tried not to give them too much encouragement. This just set them off all the more, but I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into that black spot and felt myself falling with a kind of crunch into a comfort so pure that I could not detect my body. I felt tranquil but alert behind my eyes. And as if I had all the time in the world. I realised that I wanted to give thanks. Firstly to Dennis, for helping me. I tried to send some healing energy back towards him and thanked him, repeatedly. Then I gave thanks for my friends, visiting them one by one, right to left, seeing them almost in a line standing by the main door of the Cancer Centre, approaching them to touch them lightly, my friend Meg-over-the-road, Arulesh, Claire and baby Agnes, all my friends who have been so kind, my cousins, my pupils. Gently, gently, I continued to give thanks. Then I reached my mum and my dad. I gave thanks for them. Then my Aunty Lindesay. I gave thanks for her. Then, in a pool of yellow light, Ferg. Suddenly, unexpectedly, he was with me. I was sitting with my brother, within touching distance, smiling, in easy comfort and absolute happiness. I realised that in some worlds there is no need for time. I had a strong feeling of peace and wholeness. It was a wondrous shock. I started to cry. Crying with your eyes shut is odd. You feel like your eyes are going to explode, then the tears squeeze themselves out.; Dennis said ‘Ok, that’s about it,’ and went out to fetch water. I just lay, savouring the light and peace and the fact my eyes had not exploded.; ‘Gosh, Dennis,’ I said when he returned. ‘I met my brother.’; ‘Well, yes. Near the end I do invoke the angels,’ he replied.; We went to the appointments book to make another appointment for Martha for next week. My name is down there for Dennis. I tried to give my appointment to Martha, since that lovely Christine gave me hers the other day, but he said he would fit us both in. I said ‘Dennis, are you sure?’; He said, ‘You should come again.’; Of course I really do want to have more, but I want other people to experience this. I feel like I am being over-indulged. How much healing can one person take? My cup runneth over. I don’t think that cancer could possibly survive in such an environment, in a breast so blessed. This space is full of light and love and health.; My only worry: that Dennis will become exhausted with this work. He says, no, it does not exhaust him. Once he did five people in a row, and that was a bit too much, he said. He has given me a book he wrote, of his spiritual experiences. It is really fascinating. I am going to edit it and help him to self-publish.; Gin Claire told me that her cousin Becky who is a week ahead of me with the FEC wants to meet Dennis! (Unfortunately she lives in Manchester.) She has had a worse time the second time. I will have a queue of people waiting to see him when he gets to Bishops Stortford. Claire says she is too much of a cynic to have healing herself, but even so, she is tempted. I think she should. I think Fred should too. But he said, ‘Don’t go bringing any bloody healers into the house.’ LOL TIPS. Even he can’t deny I’m healed though. Would he rather be bringing me vom buckets, muesli (with a grape if I’m lucky) and cups of green tea, or have me bounding about in singing mode, making smoothies, sweet potato mash, ratatouille, bringing him cups of tea and indulging in my rather marvellous commentary on the football? It’s a no-brainer, Fred. Unless he actually prefers me incapacitated….it’s a thought. I did used to annoy my friend George quite a lot by being too enthusiastic about the coming of Spring I remember. I used to be able to smell Spring in about January and she thought that was taking the piss. (I actually could though.) (Just for the record.) (It’s the sap rising deep inside the trees and the earth starting to breathe again. Mmm.); OMG, forgot to tell you about the injections! Tabby was very professional about it, flicking the needle and reading the instructions. Before the needle got anywhere near my fat, I screamed a long scream. It seemed to help. The parrots looked very interested. Chloe and Fred watched to learn how to do it. Tabby unfortunately has gone away, so Fred did it yesterday. I screamed even harder even though it really doesn’t hurt even a tiny bit. If I keep this up, by sometime next week the parrots will be screaming. He he. At least they’ve forgotten how to do Chloe’s rape alarm which is a relief. Although as soon as someone opens the drawer and accidentally sets it off they will remember.; The best scream I ever did was when I went to the loo in the middle of the night and Fattipus came in and let a mouse drop out of his mouth. It ran straight towards me. I climbed onto the loo seat and screamed my arse off. Fred bless im did come running for once in his life as he thought it was an axe murderer. He was really cross that it was only a mouse. But I reminded him about the bollocks and he had to agree that mice really are terrifying.; Guess what? Dennis is coming round tomorrow! I know, I’m so excited about this. I hope all the ghosts in the house don’t swarm him. He is going to heal Chloe and maybe Fred and maybe Cynic Gin Claire, maybe Arulesh if she summons up the courage. Haven’t asked Fred yet if he wants to be healed. Wouldn’t it be funny if he became a born-again? What a lol would that be right enough. He’s watching the football. I am going down now to do some insightful commentary on the Czech-Portugal game and check out the talent. Fwhooooarrr. Gorgeous!",1,1,0.16411433025591185
826,38,1,[Timestamp('2016-02-21 00:00:00')],"It’s February in Sacramento. California snow has been falling – blossoms from neighborhood fruit trees dusting the ground with white, or pink, depending on the fruit. This is the reason so many of us put up with California’s high prices, unresponsive government, and unrelenting taxes – this glorious, glorious weather. While much of the country is still buried in snow, shivering, our Sacramento spring has arrived. Last week the weather was in the upper 70s. People are out gardening, pulling weeds away from the daffodils. The urge to plant new flowers overwhelms even me, a woman with the blackest of thumbs. The weather will chill again, temporarily, but springtime weather has undeniably begun. Last week, my sister was visiting. I’d pulled the ultimate bait and switch on her, a con worthy of Slippin’ Jimmy. She’d made plans to come see me months ago when I was struggling with severe abdominal pain, the knowledge of cancer spreading through my abdomen and the thought that this time, it might be unstoppable. This new growth had jumped out of my liver and was seeding everywhere, including spots in my lungs. It had the potential to be the beginning of the end, we all thought so. By the time her plane pulled into the airport, I’d had 4 infusions of my 9th treatment regimen, Kadcyla aka TDM1, and was in remission, my second. It happened with breathtaking speed, from remission to cancer explosion to remission again. This is the easiest chemo I’d ever done, the pain is much better, energy level higher, and I’m able to think about the near future without worry again. Even my chemo brain seems to be recovering; concentration improved. I can read again and do puzzles that I haven’t been able to focus on for years. I have some pain, always now, but it is being managed well. My only new side effect is neuropathy - numb fingers and toes. A very small price to pay. My sister and I had a nice, girlish visit. A visit to a salon, shopping and lunch at Nordstrom. For me, a very full day, lots of walking. We came home and were chatting in my living room, both of us idly looking out my picture window to the street. Part of my view is blocked by a neighbor’s fence which encloses his front yard, built after he moved in. I remember when I could look out the window and see the whole of my pretty, post-war curvy street with its small, neat little homes, wave to my neighbors from the porch, see the blooming trees and flowers beyond. With that fence, I’m now cut off from half the neighborhood, my street starting right in front of my house, the light diminished and the house darker. Because of the fence, I heard laughing before I saw them. A car’s hood silently appeared, then four young men and a girl pushing a vehicle of the kind I had driven for decades: nondescript, old. A beater, we called it, the color the same rusty red as the leftover blood on a cotton ball after a poke. My street is on a slight incline so they were pushing uphill, two boy’s backs on the car’s trunk, wiry leg muscles straining, another positioned on the right side of the car, pushing from the open door. Inside, predictably, a girl steering, and beside her, another male. The boys, as I call them, were really young men. All had long hair, short sleeves, and could have been anywhere from 17 to 27 for all I could tell. They were laughing despite the circumstances, weather making it impossible to be unhappy, even in the face of lost transportation. I watched a minute and paid silent homage to all of my old beaters who had to be pushed off the road after some mysterious piece inside stopped working. How many times had I been that girl, steering, as others pushed me out of danger? Thank goodness those days are over. I turned away. My sister spoke, in a slightly urgent voice. “They’re thirsty, Ann.” “What?” I said, confused. “How do you know?” “They just are.” “Did you hear them say something?” I looked at her. I was confused, both by the urgency and certainty in her voice. “It’s hot.” She repeated. “They’re thirsty.” “Okay.” I went to the kitchen. I had four bottles of water left, sitting on the floor near the fridge, still inside the protective wrapper that was slightly dusty from dog hair. (If you come to my house and do not see animal hair, you know I have reached the end. And, my husband as well.) I ripped off the plastic overlay, grabbed the (clean) bottles and walked outside. “Hey, are you guys thirsty?” They looked at me, this skinny, bare-footed, frizzy-haired, gray-haired old lady and determined I wasn’t coming out with a broom to scream, “You kids, get offa my lawn!” One smiled and answered, “Kinda, yeah.” So I handed a water bottle to each, and apologized for being one short. The boy and girl in the front thanked me, said they didn’t mind sharing. Young love. I wished them luck and went back inside. My sister and I were not the only people who’d seen these kids. Across the street another neighbor had been out washing his car, a weekly chore for him even in the drought. (In case the water cops are reading this, he uses a bucket and never allows water to run.) He’d seen these kids coming too and like me, ignored them as they struggled by. Finishing their swigs of water, these kids started pushing again, but this time the neighbor decided to help too. He centered himself on the back of the car and gave a mighty heave. His powerful muscles, along with the boys’ skinny ones, did the trick. The car began rolling easily up the hill. Cheers erupted. My sister, by sensing their needs, had started a tiny chain of kindness. Had she not told me that she felt they were thirsty, I definitely wouldn’t have considered it. My neighbor also would not have helped without seeing me come out and bring water; they had already passed him by the time I got outside. There is a saying, “When a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world it can cause a hurricane in another part of the world."" The same can be true for these random acts of kindness. Who knows when these kids themselves may do something kind for somebody they don’t know? In this instance, the butterfly is my sister. There are so many other butterflies out there, we should be beset by hurricanes. I’ve been the recipient of more kindnesses than I can count, and to this day, continue to be blessed by the generosity of others. From simple things, like starting an Amazon shopping trip from my blog, to cards, to gifts sent, it’s opened my eyes to the world of human generosity that somehow, I had totally missed until I got sick. I recently read Sue Klebold’s book, A Mother’s Reckoning. You will remember her as the mother of one of the Columbine shooters. Like most of the country, I was horrified by Columbine, and then fascinated to the point where I have read every document about it. Much of what you think you know about Columbine has turned out to be bad reporting that has become folklore. (For the definitive book on Columbine, read David Cullen’s work.) Early on, as this tragic story unfolded, I, as so many others, wondered how a mother could miss signs of her child intending mass murder – and surely there were signs, right? Age, maturity, and cancer taught me better. I know deeply now that some things are inexplicable and unknowable - like the reasons for cancer, like the hidden thoughts of a suicidal teenager. What strikes me in her book is how many others didn’t make those kinds of snap judgments that I did. Sue writes of receiving many thousands of letters with words of support. These were people who were able to give: give her the benefit of the doubt, give her support at the worst time of her life, maybe even our country’s life, even when the media was attacking her and we were all afraid for our children. People like my sister, people like all who have reached out to me in one way or another, to try to comfort and help, are links in this chain of kindness. You are the wings of the butterfly, spreading the breeze of love through the world. It is the obligation of the rest of us, whose first nature may not be to reach out, to learn pass along the gifts of understanding and kindness we’ve been given, and to let the chain become unbroken. It may start with a bottle of water and a nudge, but that’s a good enough start. I challenge those of you reading this – as I challenge myself – to do a kind thing for somebody else this week. And notice when somebody is kind to you - when somebody allows you to squeeze in on a busy street, when you drop something and somebody picks it up for you. All of these small random acts of kindness truly do have an impact on the experience and lives of others. Report back here what you did, what was done for you, if you like.",1,1,0.08659200043653822
861,46,12,[Timestamp('2010-11-13 00:00:00')],"So the latest post-surgical update is that I STILL have not had my drain removed (sigh). I did go in last week to see Dr. Amos, and he injected an anti-biotic, doxycycline, up my drain, in the hopes that it would cause scarring in the area where my lymph nodes were removed on my right side, thus allowing the fluid in my body to by-pass the drain and be reabsorbed into my system. I can't have the drain removed until the fluid output is less than 30ml/day. Yesterday it was 45ml. Today seems to be hovering around 30-40. So unless tomorrow I drop below 30 ml, it looks like the damn drain stays in. I do have an appointment for this upcoming Nov 16 to see Dr. Amos again--at which point I will have had this drain in me for approximately 29 days or 4 weeks, since it will be 4 weeks come Monday that I'd had my bi-lateral mastectomy surgery. (big, big, sigh). I'm tired. Physically I'm tired from the surgery and lingering effects of the chemo (which can linger for up to 6 months). Psychologically and emotionally I'm tired of dealing with this drain. It is cumbersome. Imagine having a foot of tubing coming out of your body, about 4 inches below your right armpit. Imagine that it ended in a bulb slightly smaller than a deflated tennis ball and it was being held in place to your body by black surgical thread that tugged and hurt when you moved your right hand/arm in certain positions. And this is in addition to the aches and pains from the mastectomy surgery--my left side is still a bit sore and the sutures on my chest are starting to itch. Now, I want to say that all of this is very manageable--by which I mean, I'm not in so much pain that I require pills nor is this keeping me from fairly normal day to day activities. I can drive my car. I try to walk 1-2 miles a day. I keep up with my physical therapy exercises. I can cook and clean and when I wear the right combination of clothes, I can go out and about in the world without anyone knowing that there is anything different about me. But it is wearing on me--having this drain in me also requires daily attention and I am sometimes reminded that I am attached to it very acutely (like when it starts to really pain me at the end of the day). And I also have to think twice about doing some very basic things--like dressing myself or taking a shower or lifting something with my right hand. I'm *hoping* that tomorrow the scarring will really have worked and I can get this drain removed on Tuesday. Either that or I will need to have this procedure repeated, I imagine--I'll be writing to Dr. Amos to give him an update tonight. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will be closer to 35 if not 30. So beyond the lingering remnant of having this drain, emotionally I'm doing OK. I've had a few melt down/crying jags post-surgery, as one could imagine, all of which coincide with me taking a shower. I think it's just hard for me to deal with the pain of showering (and it's uncomfortable to shower and requires a lot more thought and time and care than I normally require without this drain) and because it is weird to confront my body without my breasts but perhaps more with the scars and other parts of my chest looking so foreign. It's just really weird to have part of my body missing. And I want to say more about that later. But what I wanted to acknowledge in this post are the ways that I'm already thinking ahead to marking and honoring this experience. Because I think it's important that I do something to acknowledge what I've gone through. Certainly this blog is one way that I've marked my experience--quite literally through the writing I've done around my diagnosis and treatment and surgery. And it has been enormously therapeutic for me to use language as a tool for my processing of this experience and for my healing. Yet I also want to mark and more importantly honor this experience in other ways. Because it has changed me. I mean, of course it would--but I suppose what I mean is that for all the ways in which I've resisted typical cancer and especially breast cancer narratives, I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel somehow different after what I've gone through. And I have been thinking about what I want to do to mark and honor that type of change or this process or this trial....I still am not sure what kind of language to use to talk about my cancer. And I still think of it in the present tense, even after the chemo and the surgery. Because I just don't know that I'll really ever feel that I am cancer-free. I know that in the here and now I am N.E.D.--no evidence of disease. I know that I will one day, hopefully sooner than later, start to feel like a healthy person. Like I'm back to being me--that my hair will grow back in (it already is) and that I will gain back my energy and I will be back in the classroom and back to writing my manuscript and it will almost be like nothing has changed. Almost. How to mark and honor that which cannot be fully rendered explicable and communicable? How to mark and honor an experience that has been so difficult and painful and yet, in some ways, ordinary. I say ordinary not because I think it's ""normal"" to have gone through chemo and surgery and a cancer diagnosis, but ordinary because I think so many people have gone through and go through periods in their lives when they are not healthy--when they are impaired and lack energy and where negotiating everyday aspects of their lives seems like a herculean feat. It's also hard to write about let alone think of marking and honoring an event that I'm still in the middle of--the surgery was only 4 weeks ago, I still have a drain in me, I will be on tomoxifen (a hormone treatment) for 5 years, and rates of remission are usually judged in 5 year increments. Yet another reason why I don't see myself as a cancer patient past tense. And honoring...I thought carefully before using that word in this post. But it is one I choose deliberately--that I do want to honor this experience. Not because I am ""glad"" I had cancer and that it has ""taught"" me certain lessons. It's more that I want to acknowledge that this happened to me--and that what happened to me cut to my ontological and existential core. It has marked me, and I want to mark and honor the experience--to acknowledge that I have changed and to give it the gravity of acknowledgement that it deserves. Anyway, I haven't quite decided what I will do--but I know it will not be a singular gesture. For example, I have decided to get a tattoo on my left inner ankle. I was going to do this in solidarity with my cousin Eileen when she and Jeanine (another favorite cousin) were visiting last weekend. [This is Eileen wearing my strawberry syrup wig--I think she wears it better than I do!] [Here's Jeanine at our dining room table--I swear I have a photo in almost the identical body language--we are startlingly similar to one another in that way] However, with the drain still in me, I decided (and was advised) that it was better to wait. And I realized that getting a tattoo could be one way that I would literally mark myself--so while waiting for Eileen to get her tattoo done, I decided that I would go back and get a tattoo of a lotus, because I like they symbolism (and the actual look) of the lotus--and especially with the Buddhist meditation I used to do (and hope to get back into), I thought it was fitting to have a symbol of life and mortality. [This is not the exact tattoo image I have in mind, but it gives you an idea of what I'm thinking of] I also plan to run a 4 mile race in April, in preparation for one day running a half-marathon. I've never run in a race before, yet always wanted to. So I figure training for the 4 mile run and the half-marathon would be ways I could heal (and get stronger) and be another way to mark this experience. And I imagine that there will be other ways that I will want to mark and honor what I've been through. A party might be nice (for those of you living in the Chapel Hill area, you will note that this is the first year in 6 years that I have not thrown an annual ""housewarming"" party--we're hoping to make it a belated ""housewarming"" and cancer anniversary party in April--so stay tuned!) and a trip somewhere might be nice. And maybe writing about this, as an essay or an academic article, a conference paper, or dare I say it: as a book, might be nice. I will have to think about what feels right to me as time passes. And I know I have to be open to changing my mind about all of this. Anyway, I'm open to suggestions from the blogosphere (and from friends near and far) and I will certainly keep you posted about the drain situation after Nov. 16. [UPDATE--MONDAY, NOV 15: Two friends, Jim & Ashley, just sent me a link to this NY Times Magazine essay questioning the pinkwashing of breast cancer activism--the ways in which a narrative and rhetoric of breast cancer as sexy and a disease that women will kick butt in has trumped other types of stories and experiences of the disease. When I read it, I felt like Peggy Ornstein had been in my head and reading this blog. I'm glad to know that mine is not the only dissenting voice about breast cancer out there]",1,1,0.06316607634789452
868,46,19,[Timestamp('2011-09-18 00:00:00')],"So I'm sure we are all familiar with the very emotional and sentimental films featuring stoic women (and usually they are women although sometimes, as in Brian's Song, they are men). Love Story and Terms of Endearment top the list of these sorts of films. Well, Pink Ribbon Inc. and 50/50 do not seem to fit into that mold. Neither of these films is out, just yet. But my friend Anita sent me the trailer to Pink Ribbons Inc. and I am very excited to see this film when it comes out (hopefully in early 2012, although I may spring for the DVD which you can buy on their website). The Canadian filmmakers who produced this film were inspired by Samantha King's book of the same name--the film, like the book, seems to take a critical look at the pink ribbon industry that has been built up over the last decade--the many different consumer items that are branded with the pink ribbon and sold in the name of research and finding a cure. Which makes it feel like you are making a profit off of a disease--at least it makes me feel that way sometimes depending on my mood. I still see those pink ribbons everywhere--most recently on a box of Morton's Salt that I bought at my local grocery store. There were two boxes of salt sold for the same price, one had a pink ribbon and the other didn't. Not sure why--wouldn't it seem as if the box with the pink ribbon should be more expensive because if Morton's is giving money for breast cancer research it would want people buying the pink ribbon salt to pay a nickel more to help women with breast cancer? I know I've written about King's book and my own reaction to Pink Ribbon commercialization before (click here). I hope this film reaches a lot of people--certainly more people would watch this film than would pick up King's book, so I'm glad in that way that her message and the critique of the corporatization of the pink ribbon will get the audience it deserves--and hopefully will get people thinking about what they are buying when they make a conscious choice to purchase a pink ribbon item. As for the film 50/50, I saw the trailer in the movie theater recently and became VERY EXCITED because this seems to be a film geared towards the average person who either has had a cancer diagnosis and/or their friends and family--and we all just are overwhelmed and clueless about how to proceed. Today one of the stars and writer/producer's of the film, Seth Rogen, along with his friend and co-writer and inspiration for the film, Will Reiser, were on Weekend Edition Sunday talking about making the film and about Reiser's own cancer diagnosis (which the film is loosely based upon). Listening to them talk about making the film was refreshing. Because the truth is, when you have this diagnosis, when you are living with cancer and going through treatment, there are so MANY THINGS THAT SEEM ABSURD. And you or at least I couldn't dwell on the tragedy of it all and had to see the comedy or the absurdity in my situation. And being able to laugh is a great therapy in and of itself. As is anger, I think--which is why I titled the blog No Fucking Pink Ribbons. Anyway, I leave you with trailers for both films--50/50 will open on September 30 and I hope Pink Ribbons Inc. comes to my local independent theater--if not, I'm definitely springing for the film, because I know it is a must watch for me.

870,46,20,[Timestamp('2011-10-22 00:00:00')],"A week ago a friend of mine, Greg, posted on my Facebook page that he half expected to hear me during an NPR piece lamenting breast cancer awareness month (click here for the link to the story, where you can also hear the piece). And, of course, I've never been the only person who has expressed a distaste for the pink ribbon (although I might be the only person to have a blog decrying them as ""fucking"" pink ribbons--those missing asterisks don't leave much for the imagination). Karuna Jaggar, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, recently discussed the insidious pink-washing being done every October on the WBUR NPR show, ""On the Point."" But I do find it heartening not to be the only one questioning pink ribbon culture. There is Samantha King's work, which I've written about previously (and the film version, I hope, will reach LOTS OF PEOPLE). And there's Gayle Sulik's book, Pink Ribbon Blues, which also questions the dark underbelly of pink ribbon culture. And of course there's Barbara Ehrenreich's essay, ""Welcome to Cancerland."" But it also seems like more and more people are really questioning what's going on with breast cancer philanthropy and whether we have ""pink fatigue"" and the efficacy of breast cancer research--the fact that only 3% of breast cancer funding goes to treating metastatic breast cancer--which is the stage IV kind that kills women--it's the kind emblemized in those stats that tell us that breast cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death for women. Women don't die of stage I, II, or III breast cancer, and usually they don't die due to complications in treatment (although it does occasionally happen). Women (and the few men who are diagnosed) die because their cancer has metastized to other parts of their body (and this blog that I recently discovered chronicles what it's like to live with metastatic cancer, as well as the frustration at the lack of funding for metastatic cancer treatment). And this should make us ANGRY. And we should turn our anger into ACTIVISM. Because really, the time for awareness is over. We all know about breast cancer. We all know someone who has had breast cancer. And we certainly all know someone who has had SOME type of cancer. So what we need, right now, is action. We need to get mad and we need to do something. Not to just detect it early. Not to just get appropriate treatment. But to try to prevent anyone from ever getting this disease and needing treatment. Just what type of action to take...I suppose this is part of the problem. I'm thinking on it. And if you have suggestions, please post them. I really do want to be part of the solution--to be an activist not just someone who raises awareness every October. And certainly not by wearing or buying anything associated with a pink ribbon.",1,1,0.027130832130832137
875,46,25,[Timestamp('2011-03-09 00:00:00')],"So here's a confession: I've been depressed. I'm not exactly sure how long I've been depressed, but I definitely think it coincided with being back in the classroom, which means mid-January. Which means probably I've been carrying around a low-level funk for the last three months. I've assumed that it would pass--this feeling of melancholy and sadness that seems to sit with me. I assumed that there is no rational reason for me to feel this way--that I am back in the classroom and resuming my life and so why would I feel depressed? Why should I feel sad? I'm alive. My hair grew back. I'm done with chemotherapy and surgery. The only current treatment I'm on is the tamoxifen. And then today a friend and colleague who has been through a similar experience wrote to me and shared that this period that I'm in--the transition from diagnosis & treatment to life AFTER and INTO, in her phrase, ""a new normal"" or ""new identity"" was very difficult for her. Reading that it hit me: it is difficult for me. I walked to the grocery store and thought about the nature of my depression--just WHY I felt so sad, and I realized that I'm in a state of mourning: I am grieving for my life pre-cancer diagnosis. There is so much grief and mourning that we associate with cancer--and usually we think of it specifically around someone's death--that cancer has claimed so many lives. And that certainly is true--that certainly is the existential heart of why cancer is so fearsome and difficult--because it does claim so many lives. But there's another aspect of mourning and grief related to a cancer diagnosis--and that is the certainty of living your life without the knowledge of cancer. I no longer have that certainty. Now, I just want to be clear. I am not fearful of a recurrence in the sense that I am hyper-anxious or that I'm doing or not doing things because I fear a cancer recurrence. I am also acutely aware that of the various kinds of cancer that one could be afflicted with, having stage 2 breast cancer that has not metastatized is not as traumatic a diagnosis as other kinds of cancer diagnoses. I say this not to rank cancers (because that's like ranking oppressions) but to acknowledge that in many ways I'm lucky. I have a type of cancer that has a lot of exposure/fund raising/research in which women, like myself, have benefitted materially. Once upon a time, breast cancer was a death sentence--and because of all those pink ribbons or more to the point, the money raised and used in research that the pink ribbons helped to bring about, I am the recipient of better treatment protocols and therapies. But even if I think of stage 2 breast cancer as a ""good"" cancer--as a ""curable"" cancer--the truth is, I don't feel cured. I don't feel like I'm cancer free. I don't feel like a survivor. I also don't feel jinxed or unlucky or fated to die an early death. What I do feel is uncertainty. I am just not sure. Not sure whether the cancer will come back. Not sure if it does come back whether it will lead to an earlier death than I would have had. Not sure whether any other aches or pains or bumps on my body are indicative of cancer in other parts of my body that are harder for me to see--my ovaries, my uterus, my liver, my pancreas. And I am in grief and mourning because I feel like however briefly I have thought about it--I am all too aware of my own mortality--of the fragility of my body--that at some point, whether because of cancer or some other force, I will one day die. And to think about your mortality, to feel it keenly, however briefly, is something that stays with you. It's like my mastectomy scars--it's not something I am conscious of 24/7, but it is a permanent reminder on my body, of my body, in my body. I am also in grief and mourning over things that will no longer come to pass--most specifically having a biological child with Matthew. Perhaps this wouldn't have happened regardless of cancer. But the fertility issue was really complicated by chemo and made more impossible by my tamoxifen treatment. And then there's my age--being 41 doesn't exactly spell the height of fertility. So like I said, it's not like this was ever a lock for us--but knowing that my cancer treatments have shut that door has been part of my grief and mourning--even while we both recognize and are excited by a adoption plans (which we aren't enacting just yet since I'd like to say I'm a year cancer-free or at least post-surgery before starting any adoption procedures). I wasn't going to write about any of this--it seemed all too personal and private. But then I thought it was important to put this out there. I'm not exactly sure who is reading this blog anymore, but I know that some people have found their way here because you may also be going through what I'm going through (or went through). And I thought that just as my friend reached out to me and shared part of her own difficulties during this moment of transition, it was important for me to also note that this period of transition is hard. I am sad. And I will be finding help--I've put a call out to a therapist and hopefully will be seeing her soon. Finally, the last thing I'll leave you with is that I think my other reluctance to share this phase that I'm in, is feeling like I have to be strong and to reassure everyone that I'm OK. And I am OK, in the sense that I'm not having any pain or awful side effects -- and that exhaustion/fatigue are really the last lingering vestiges of chemo and surgery that I'm carrying with me in terms of cancer treatment. But in other ways, I'm really not OK. I'm not OK with having this diagnosis. Or having surgery to remove both my breasts. Or living with the tightness around my scars--or sometimes seeing myself in the shower or in the mirror and feeling this tiny shock of seeing myself as if for the first time, breastless.",1,-1,-0.027138965903010848
877,46,3,[Timestamp('2013-03-14 00:00:00')],"So I meant to write about attending the Herstories: Breast Cancer Narratives and CounterNarratives symposium right after I got back on March 2 because it was such a wonderful event and it was eye opening for me in many ways. The first thing I have to say is that I didn't realize how much I wanted to be with other women who had experienced breast cancer. When I was first diagnosed and then going through chemotherapy, many people offered to put me in touch with women who had had breast cancer and friends and relatives (especially those who had gone through their own bouts of cancer) had talked about how important community is and the friends you develop in the chemo chair. But I didn't want that. Not then. When I was in the thick of things, when I was going through chemo and then preparing for surgery and then recovering from surgery, I didn't want to know other women who had gone through breast cancer or who were going through similar things. I know that might sound perverse--it felt perverse at the time. I tried going to yoga at Cornucopia Place and got totally freaked out the one time I went because it was filled with these women who had gone through cancer (mostly breast cancer) and they were laughing and joking and talking about their experiences (and most were post-chemo/surgery -- I think one woman was re-starting chemo but we seemed to be the only 2 women in active treatment) and it really freaked me out. I'm not exactly sure why--maybe because I didn't identify as someone who was NED (no evidence of disease) as many of these women did. Maybe because I was in the thick of things. Maybe because I was angry. So fast forward to March 1 & 2. I'm at Wake Forest University listening to some pretty incredible people talk about their experiences with breast cancer--either from the perspective of being doctors/caregivers or family members of someone with breast cancer or with being women who had the disease. And it was over lunch as I was sitting at a table with two women, both academics, both survivors, that I realized how glad I was to be sitting with them and talking with them about our shared experiences. We exchanged stories about the weird and stupid and odd things that got said to us when we were diagnosed with breast cancer (one woman shared that a friend told her that she didn't seem like the kind of person who got breast cancer, to which she said, ""What's the profile of a breast cancer patient?""--we both totally cracked up at her story--and maybe it's not THAT funny, but at the time it seemed hysterically funny. And it reminded me about the easy camaraderie of the women in the yoga group. I asked one of my tablemates about whether she ever stopped thinking about recurrence now that she was at the 5 year mark (she just had her 5 year check up last month) and she said that it does lessen--that especially that 5 year mark seems significant in terms of turning a mental corner. It was comforting talking with her and with my other tablemate who had finished treatment and was embarking on breast reconstruction. Our experiences were different yet similar--and perhaps one similarity was the desire that all 3 of us had to try to narrate our stories--to try to talk about and write about what we had gone through. That was a large point, perhaps the main point, about this conference--trying to listen to the stories of women going through a breast cancer diagnosis. Trying to hear what women with cancer have to say about the disease and their treatment and their relationships with family and friends, but also to hear about the ways that the disease isn't the only thing that is defining them. People talked about the importance of humor. About empowering women in their decisions and in telling their stories. People talked about resisting the corporatization of breast cancer in its pink ribbon incarnation. People reminded health care professionals (oncologists, surgeons, nurses, radiologists) about the importance of listening, really listening, to what women have to say. And one woman gave this amazing 20 minute power point presentation about the history of breast cancer from the time of the ancients to our present day culture. I am not doing justice to how much I learned and took away from this experience. I not only got to listen and learn, I got to meet and have 1:1 conversations with these panelists (because it was a fairly small conference, about 50-80 on average attended each session). You can click here to see the full conference schedule and I'd definitely recommend trying to google folks whose talks seem interesting. Just to highlight a few, Amy Boesky (Boston College) has a memoir about her family and being positive for the BRCA mutation (she was also recently on NPR where she outed herself as one of the writers of the Sweet Valley High series!). I met Ana Iltis who is editing a journal, Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics, that strives to tell the stories of people who are typically not enfranchised to have their voices heard, and she told this remarkable (and anger producing) story about her husband's aunt who was not treated with respect by the medical establishment. I talked with Kathryn Montgomery, a leading researcher in the field of medical humanities, who shared stories about her daughter's breast cancer (and its recurrence), and I was inspired by Hephzibah Roskelly, a fellow English professor down the road at UNC Greensboro who has talked theorized about her experiences with breast cancer in a way that is so smart and accessible and powerful. All of which left me, at the end of this 2 day event, feeling like I might be ready to try to construct my own narrative about breast cancer.",1,1,0.14676374961185087
881,46,7,[Timestamp('2013-02-28 00:00:00')],"I should really have posted this a week ago -- I sometimes forget that I have this blog (awful, I know) and then I remember and I think about all the things I want to be writing in this space, could be writing in this space and SHOULD be writing in this space. Like this upcoming symposium at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. Because this is such short notice, only folks who live in the greater NC area will probably be able to come (unless, of course, you were aware of this symposium much earlier). I'll be giving a full report because I'm going both Friday & Saturday. But for any of you who do live driving distance to Winston-Salem, please consider checking out at least Saturday's offerings--you can find the program of events on the Wake Forest Humanities Institute Page (click here). The conference is free and is devoted to examining breast cancer narratives and counter narratives--like critiquing pink ribbon culture. So OF COURSE I had to go--I mean, look at the keynote speaker and what she's going to talk about: KEYNOTE ADDRESS: “The Self-Telling Body—Who Tells Whom in Breast Cancer Narratives?” Rita Charon, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Executive Director of the Program in Narrative Medicine, Columbia University [That's for Friday night at 6pm] And then, of course, there's this description for the last panel on Saturday: 2:30 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. PANEL: THEORIZING BREAST CANCER NARRATIVES This panel will offer literary, philosophical, and cultural approaches to analyzing breast cancer narratives in the twenty-first century. Topics will include the expansion of visual representations, links between genetic narratives and feminist theories of the body, concepts of the posthuman, analysis of pink ribbon culture, and pragmatist and bioethical inquiry into the lived experience of this disease. But whether you're able to come at the last minute or not, I promise to write up my experiences of attending when I'm back on Sunday.",1,1,0.054409090909090914
888,48,13,[Timestamp('2014-12-31 00:00:00')],"Having made and promptly broken every resolution made for New Years in the past, I’m trying something different this year. I have decided to pick 2 keywords as my themes for the year which will hopefully guide my actions in the 12 months ahead. The words I have chosen for 2015 are “create” and “giving”. I want to build up and not tear down. I would like to make something new, whether it is a new blog post, an article written out of my comfort zone, an e-book, or building a sense of community in my online and virtual worlds. I want to share my experiences more transparently and honestly in the hopes that even one reader will say to herself, “hey, I’m not alone feeling this way”. As I wrote in an earlier post, The Winning Ticket, I want to give back to my community, not keep taking from it. In terms of this blog, I want to create a safe place where we can exchange our stories freely, offer much needed emotional support to each other, and not worry if our stories do not resemble the”official” one of happy smiling pink-suited survivors. As far as giving back or paying it forward, I would like to be even more candid about sharing my experiences with having triple negative breast cancer 4 Times. While I am not a doctor and can’t offer medical advice, I have almost 27 years of personal experience with this disease. I have gained a certain amount of knowledge about breast cancer and recurrences/new primaries as well as living with a BRCA1 positive gene during this time. There was a recent post called Breast Cancer: It Is Going To Be A Bumpy Ride where I danced around the topic of whether or not I personally suffered from PTSD. Some readers figured it out while others didn’t. Yes, I have had depression, anxiety, panic attacks and flashbacks for years but was not properly diagnosed with PTSD until 6 weeks ago. Since then, a new medication has been added to my antidepressant and anti-anxiety cocktail and I am feeling lighter than I have in years. So why did I not just come out and say that in the post? Was I so afraid of labels about my mental health that I felt a need to detach myself from this particular diagnosis? If nothing else, I would like to turn my negative experiences into something positive that others can relate to and realize they are not alone. I have had the symptoms for PTSD for many years and now with the official diagnosis, it is finally being appropriately treated. I feel better! And that is nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of for any cancer survivor. I hope my themes work better than my resolutions ever did. What about you? Are you making New Year’s resolutions or goals or themes? Why or why not? If you are comfortable doing so, please share these or any other concerns in the comments. Have a Happy healthy joyous 2015!

896,48,20,[Timestamp('2014-11-23 00:00:00')],"Over the past 2 decades, the media has painted a picture of the ideal breast cancer survivor. We see a smiling white middle aged woman telling the world how she beat breast cancer with her positive attitude and her unwillingness to ever give up the fight. She doesn’t just stop with the lessons of how she beat breast cancer. She continues her story with how having conquered cancer, her whole life has changed for the better. To her, cancer was the greatest gift she ever received from the benevolent universe. We sometimes hear that her reconstructed breasts look better than they did pre-cancer. How lucky she was to have gotten a free boob job! The hair loss was a bit of a drag but it grew back better than before. She speaks of how breast cancer has brought her closer to her friends and family. Breast cancer was a tiny blip in her life, no more annoying or life threatening than a root canal. Breast cancer has been described as the “good” cancer to get as everyone wears pink, races around a lot, and nobody ever dies. I have no doubt that this does represent reality for some breast cancer survivors. It is also possible that some of these smiling women have repressed the worst aspects of their breast cancer experience and are choosing to only publicize the positive things that happened along the way. They present their stories through a gauzy pink veil that filters out the bad memories leaving only the good. We don’t see pictures of the very young or the pregnant or the Stage 4 breast cancer patients. We don’t see many pictures of women as they are trudging through treatment, pale and bald. We don’t hear about the single mothers who go through treatment with little family support. We don’t see the black faces or the Asian, or the Hispanic ones. The media has painted a simplified and unrealistic picture that doesn’t accurately reflect the many faces or feelings of breast cancer. The problems with this stereotype are many and they are troubling. Most survivors I”ve met in person or online do not relate to breast cancer being the greatest experience of their life. They remember the fear they felt when first diagnosed. Until they had the tumour removed and all the tests done, they didn’t know if the cancer had spread and if they were already dying. They remember the pain of their treatment, whether it was surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or some combination of all three. They may have received a lot of emotional and practical support during the diagnostic and the early treatment phases of their cancer only to find people slipping away the more time passes. If they had reconstruction on one or both breasts, there may have been multiple painful surgeries involved with tissue expanders, implants, or the removal of another body part (skin and muscle from the stomach, back, or buttocks) to create the new breast(s). The end result of this surgery may still leave them with body image issues with the reconstructed breast not matching the natural one, the implant becoming hard and encapsulated with scar tissue, or even the body rejecting the transplanted body part and the person being left with no breast(s) at all, either temporarily or permanently. And what is never mentioned is that even if the reconstructed breasts look cosmetically wonderful, almost all feeling and sensation is gone. Forever. Women are often fearful of the cancer recurring again or it spreading and metastisizing to their bones, lungs, liver, or brain. They may fear leaving young children behind should their cancer spread and they die. They may find their shaky marriages dissolving from the extra weight of a cancer diagnosis. They will soon learn who their true friends are and will watch others in their life simply disappear as news of their breast cancer becomes known. About 10% of breast cancer patients will learn that they are already Stage 4 at the time of the initial diagnosis. Another 30% will reach this stage eventually even if their initial cancers were caught at an early stage. There is no Stage 5. Stage 4 means the cancer has already spread elsewhere in the body. It can only be treated, not cured. Stage 4 is the only kind of cancer that kills although medical advances have allowed women to live longer with Stage 4 cancer than ever before. But for these women, chemotherapy and other treatments may go on for the rest of their lives, to keep the cancer from spreading even further. They will never “beat cancer”. Their stories aren’t popular in the media. Other women like myself will have cancer recurrences or grow new primary breast cancers in the same or the other breast. We do not die from local recurrences but the fear is even greater the second (or third or fourth time around). We know we are pushing our luck on the cancer wheel of fortune. How often can we keep catching recurrences in time before they spread into distant body parts? You don’t see many women in commercials saying I thought I beat cancer once but then it came back and I am in treatment again. This doesn’t fit with the storyline that if it is caught early and you survive 5 years, you have beaten cancer. Stage 1 – 3 patients may be strong and full of fighting spirit while going through treatment but then fall apart when treatment ends. This is a fairly common occurrence as it feels that your medical safety net is gone without the constant monitoring of your health by medical professionals. While active treatment can be very tough, there is still something reassuring about being seen by a medical team on a regular basis. Also, cancer treatment is like a full-time job with numerous appointments to see oncologists, plastic surgeons, and lab technicians. It is easy to set milestones and goals – 1 chemo down, 5 more to go. Treatment gives structure to your days and a final goal to keep working towards – the end of treatment. When that abruptly comes to an end, many survivors are left wondering, “what happens now?” Friends and family may not be as supportive now that treatment is over. They feel that the worst is over now that you have completed surgery , chemotherapy, and/or radiation. They move on to other people and things, leaving you alone at a time when you might need their emotional support the most. You may feel pushed and rushed by others to immediately resume your pre-cancer life once treatment ends and to put all that negative cancer stuff behind you. You may question yourself as to why you aren’t bouncing back from treatment more quickly like your friends, family, and the pink media ladies say you should. Your doctors may tell you to find your “new normal” before you even have had time to reflect on the very abnormal process that you have just experienced. Once you have had cancer, every follow- up oncologist appointment and every new scan, mammogram, or blood test brings anxiety levels up sky high again. Every new headache could be a brain tumour and every new ache and pain could be a sign that the cancer has spread to your bones. You may wonder to yourself what you are doing wrong – why you didn’t find your pot of gold at the end of the pink rainbow. It does a disservice to those newly diagnosed and those just starting their cancer treatment process to portray breast cancer survivors as a uniformly brave, strong, courageous, and positive group of women. We survivors are all those things and more. But we are also scared, anxious, in pain, confused, disoriented, and angry at times. And that is normal. And that is okay. Doctors have known for decades that a cancer diagnosis is an extremely stressful event and freely hand out anti-anxiety medication throughout the treatment process. They have heard their chemotherapy patients complain for years about “chemo brain” where forgetfulness and short term memory loss are common features that linger on after chemotherapy ends. They know many women suffer from the shock of a completely altered body with their breasts removed by mastectomy, their hair lost to chemotherapy, and their reproductive systems pushed into early menopause, either temporarily or permanently, by chemotherapy. New American studies have shown that approximately 25% of breast cancer patients will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder sometime between diagnosis and the end of treatment. European studies have placed that number at closer to 50% of patients. Many of these newly diagnosed women are in their 20’s and 30’s, just starting careers or families. Many received their breast cancer diagnosis while pregnant or while still breast feeding shortly after giving birth. Others are encouraged to undergo fertility treatment before starting chemotherapy so that their eggs can be frozen in the event that premature ovarian failure or permanent menopause prevents a future pregnancy. More women each year are being tested for genetic defects that can hugely increase their risk of breast and ovarian cancers. If they test positive for a mutation, they will be strongly encouraged to have a double mastectomy and to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed by age 35. If they test positive for a mutation, this becomes a family affair with the whole immediate and extended family having to decide if they too should be tested to see if they also have the same genetic mutation. If a woman already has children, she will learn that each of her children, male and female, have a 50% chance of also inheriting this mutated gene. As genetic testing is not carried out on children, she will have to wait until they turn 18 and decide whether to get tested to see if she has passed her mutated gene onto her children. It can be encouraging to read stories of women who have survived for many years after a cancer diagnosis without a recurrence or without the cancer spreading. All the memes on the internet urging you “to fight like a girl” or “to beat cancer’s ass” or even the more blunt and to the point, “Fuck cancer”, can be very empowering for both the woman undergoing treatment and the long term survivor. But I know for myself that it is difficult to stay in fighter mode 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Again, speaking only for myself, I can’t live on a constant diet of positivity messages when I read or talk about cancer. It is like living on a high sugar diet. After awhile, the sugar buzz fades and I come crashing down. Hard. Cancer has definitely changed my life, not always for the better. I need to read about the struggles of the newly diagnosed, the stories of women going through treatment, and especially the stories of the women with Stage 4 cancer. I need the grit of painful reality so I don’t forget where I came from and what I went through. I need these stories so I don’t sugar coat my story for the next person struggling with some of breast cancer’s less positive realities, thinking to myself that cancer or treatment or facing multiple new primaries wasn’t all that bad. It was that bad and some days still is. What is your cancer story? Do you prefer only to read positive stories or can you make room for some less positive ones as well?

898,48,22,[Timestamp('2014-11-12 00:00:00')],"I have been reading about breast cancer prevention and cures since my mother was diagnosed with the disease in 1980. I picked up the pace with my own first diagnosis in 1988. Some “facts” and some trends have come and gone while others are repackaged with new names 20 years later. If you believed and tried to follow all the advice floating around the internet, you would soon drive yourself crazy. Even the experts get it wrong sometimes. In the 70’s to the mid 80’s, the alternative cure of the day was laetrile, a compound made from apricot pits. People travelled to Mexico for this wonder cure that wasn’t available in Canada or the US. It went out of fashion as it didn’t seem to actually cure anyone and led to their early death if they were not using traditional medicine alongside it. The next big wave of prevention and cure methods focused on the mind. Guided visualization was the rage in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Basically it was a type of meditation where you listened to a tape that encouraged you to picture your cancer as weak disorganized blobs while the strong army of chemotherapy warriors came down and slaughtered them all. The premise was that your mind could cure your cancer through these vivid images. Unfortunately for me, these images were anything but calming and empowering. I began having nightmares of raging armies chasing after me, trying to kill me. I stopped going to these “healing” sessions and felt much better for it. This was cancer failure number 1. I was a guided visualization student drop-out. The other component to preventing or curing cancer with your mind was developing a uniformly positive attitude towards life. There was some research being cited that said optimistic cancer patients lived longer and had less recurrences and metastisies than pessimistic patients. Further research has not been able to duplicate those results. It is now thought that a positive outlook may increase your quality of life but it won’t prevent further disease or lengthen your stay here on Earth. But at the time of my first cancer in 1988, the positive thinking rule was firmly in place. I wasn’t a uniformly positive person. I was sad, angry, scared, confused and frustrated with both the disease and the effects it had on my life. Hearing that I had to remain positive at all costs did nothing but add another layer of guilt to my emotions when I found I did not always feel happy. Now I was suddenly responsible for causing my cancer in the first place by thinking negative thoughts and would be responsible for any recurrences or metastasis that later arose. I did not find that knowledge particularly empowering or encouraging. That was cancer failure number 2, being more of an Anxious Annie than a Perky Penny. My mother battled 4 types of cancer in 12 years and managed to remain optimistic under the most dire of circumstances. She died after that 12 year battle, still visualizing until the end. I thought that if the most positive person I have ever known could get 4 different cancers and die from the disease, what hope is there for someone like me? But at the same time, I started to get the nagging feeling that maybe, just maybe, it was the theory that was wrong and that the experts didn’t always know as much as they thought they did. I tested this theory on my breast cancer surgeon. He had told me at age 29 (first cancer) and 34 (second cancer found at my 5 year “cure” appointment), that I would have to wait 5 years to get pregnant from the time of each new diagnosis. I asked him why this was given that my cancers were not affected by hormones. He did not give me a scientific answer but he did get me to stop asking him the question. His less than tactful answer was that if I got pregnant now, “Baby may not have a Mommy in 5 years time”. Somewhere in the back of my mind I realized that he didn’t really have an answer to the specific question I posed. His answer told me science knew very little about 29 year old or 34 year old women with hormone negative breast cancer. That made sense as most breast cancer patients are diagnosed with the disease at a much older age when pregnancy isn’t an issue and their cancers are more likely to be hormone positive. That realization was freeing as it taught me to at least question the expert advice I had been given, to do my own research, to ask tough questions, and to make my own decisions. Now that was empowering knowledge! My suspicions about my surgeon’s lack of answers to the pregnancy question were confirmed 2 years later with cancer number 3. I had a new surgeon and posed the pregnancy question to her. She said that doctors no longer applied the 5 year pregnancy rule. She said I was 36, had 9 months of chemotherapy, and would likely have early ovarian failure and early menopause. She said if I wanted to get pregnant, I had better do it now before it was too late. Shortly afterwards my then-husband and I found ourselves in a local fertility clinic that had never dealt with women with a past history of breast cancer before. They consulted with my Cancer Clinic about the advisability of my taking fertility hormones. The initial response from the Cancer Clinic was they had never dealt with this situation before and they would have to consult with other oncologists in other areas of the country. The end result was that I had 2 courses of IVF treatment but I didn’t get pregnant. At least I got to try and it all worked out in the end with the adoption of 2 children. Even more importantly, the mega doses of hormones I took during each IVF treatment did not kill me as my first surgeon seemed to think pregnancy hormones would do. Medical science does not know everything. You have to do your own research and make the decisions that are right for you, even if they are not popular at the time. I have had many more cancer fails over the years. I don’t identify much with what the media seems to portray as the ideal breast cancer survivor. You know the one dressed in pink who talks about how breast cancer changed her life for the better, how treatment was just a small dip in her otherwise perfect life, and how she is now happy, happy, happy that all that bad stuff is behind her because SHE BEAT CANCER. While this may accurately represent some survivors’ realities, it doesn’t represent mine. I was frightened at each diagnosis. I found surgery painful, radiation exhausting, and chemotherapy nauseating. I haven’t beaten cancer although I hit the 5 year “cure” mark with cancers 1 and 3 only to have it return again. I won’t have beaten breast cancer until I die from some other cause. I worry about leaving my children behind at too young of an age as my mother left me. Cancer failure number 3 – cancer was not the best thing that ever happened to me. And once again, I am not Happy, Happy, Happy all the time. It is the think positive movement all over again, except this time it is wearing a pink track suit and is “running for the cure”. Many of these examples I have given were from the pre-internet days where you were exposed to a limited number of medical opinions from the Drs. you dealt with and the books or magazine articles you read. Now with a few minutes of googling, you can find a mountain of research and websites giving information on everything from miracle cures by diet and supplements, to using the law of attraction to bring you good health, to the latest advances in medical technology, and to lists of all the clinical trials across the world. Trends in cancer prevention and cure come and go in the blink of an eye. One day we are supposed to take shark cartilage supplements because sharks don’t get cancer and the next day we are told that logic is just bad science. Last year seemed to be all about not letting your water bottles get warm in the sun and not wearing a cell phone in your bra. This year, it’s all about avoiding sugar, alcohol, and dairy products. When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, lumpectomy with radiation was the popular treatment of the day. Now the tide has turned and double mastectomy is all the rage. The guided visualization sessions of the 80’s and 90’s are now mindful meditation groups. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Are you doing breast cancer right? Is there even a right way to do breast cancer? With so much information available about advances in traditional medicine and on the other side, complementary or alternative treatments, how can a person know what is the right thing to do? I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but these are some suggestions for sorting the good ideas from the bad. First, get a copy of all the records and reports that relate to your cancer. The pathology reports will provide information about the kind of tumour you have, it’s hormone status, it’s size, it’s grade and it’s stage. As the treatment varies depending on the kind of breast cancer you have and the stage it was detected at, you need this information to do any meaningful research on your particular cancer. If there are terms in the pathology report you don’t understand, an online medical dictionary is only a click away. Secondly, ask your doctor lots of questions, even the ones you think are too dumb to say out loud. Write your questions out in advance so you don’t forget to ask something important. Bring a friend, a notebook and a pen, or a tape recorder as you may forget the information you receive, especially if it is in the early days of a cancer diagnosis when you are already feeling overwhelmed. If you are interested in complementary holistic treatments, ask your doctor if there are any that are available to you at your hospital or clinic. If you are taking holistic supplements, tell your oncologist as some types can interfere with traditional treatments, especially chemotherapy. Contrary to popular belief, there are many oncologists who will support the use of some forms of complementary treatments. On the other hand, you probably will not find a medical doctor who supports you taking a completely alternative approach instead of one of the traditional forms of medical treatment. Think of Steve Jobs and Farrah Fawcett, two celebrities who tried to cure their cancer in non-traditional ways. What else do they have in common besides their cancer and their celebrity status? They are both dead. Medical science may not have all the answers but it does have ways to prolong life and halt the progression of this deadly disease, at least for awhile. Third, when doing research, consider the source you are consulting to see if it is reliable and respected. Medical research should be based on controlled scientific studies that can be duplicated by others who will get the same results. “Research” that consists solely of testimonials and celebrity endorsements is not research at all but is usually a scam to get your money. Also be wary of bold statements made in the popular press saying that scientists found this substance causes cancer or that scientists have found using this substance will cure cancer. These headlines are often misleading as the actual studies may have been done on mice or rats and human trials, if they ever get that far, are a decade or more away. Finally, I would suggest you join a support group, especially a large online one, to pose questions and learn the different approaches being taken across the continent by others living with the same kind of cancer as you. A support group is a great place to find people who can answer your questions of what chemotherapy or radiation are really like from a patient’s perspective rather than from a doctor’s point of view. It is the kind of place where others understand your fears and concerns, having lived them too. It can be a great place for emotional support on the bad days and for congratulations on the good days when you have cleared a treatment hurdle or reached a milestone of any kind. I no longer think there is a right way or a wrong way to live with, prevent, or treat breast cancer. There are many decisions to be made at every step along the way. You sometimes choose treatments you don’t really want to do because they will prolong your life a little or a lot, but not every decision is of the life and death variety. As so much cancer advice has a very short shelf life, it is really not necessary to jump on every new band wagon that rolls into town. Until science has more definite answers as to why 40% of us die from breast cancer while the other 60% of us do not, follow the tips that make sense to you and leave the rest behind. They will all be forgotten anyway when the next hot tip of the day comes around.

900,48,24,[Timestamp('2014-11-03 00:00:00')],"Goodbye October with its pink ribbons, pink merchandise, and silly pink uniformed athletes. The color pink in October symbolizes breast cancer awareness month. Some people run races for “the cure” while others buy pink trinkets that promise to donate some (tiny) portion of the purchase price to an unspecified breast cancer charity. There is a lot of controversy about Pinktober in the breast cancer community. Many survivors hate it as all the money spent on “going pink” translates into very little money spent on actual breast cancer research for better lives, better treatment, or an actual cure for the disease. After the merchants and the big cancer charities take their cut of the profits and donations, the little money left goes to promoting breast cancer awareness and to organizing more pinktober races and events for the next year. I think it is safe to say that the majority of the nation is already very aware that breast cancer exists. They may not be aware that early detection and yearly mammograms do not always save lives. Some 30-40% of us continue to die of the disease. There is nothing pretty or pink about any kind of death from cancer. When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer at 29 in the Dark Ages of 1988, Pinktober didn’t exist. Neither did the internet with its information and support groups. It was still seen as an old ladies’ disease and at 29, I had no sense of community with others in my age group that were fighting this disease. I would have loved a pink ribbon and people running races on my behalf. Pinktober did what it set out to do and took breast cancer out of the closet and into the light. But with that goal accomplished, Pinktober has turned into a massively commercial operation, a lumbering elephant, that exists with no clear purpose anymore. Instead of going pink, try donating directly to Metavivor, one of the few breast cancer charities that actually spends all its donation money on research for a cure. Or better yet, if you know someone with breast cancer, offer to drive them for treatments, look after their kids for a few hours, or bring by some groceries or a few home cooked meals. This will do more to support those living with the disease than all the pink ribbons or Save the Tatas teeshirts you can buy. Happy November everyone! No more pink for another year. Thank God.

The title of the blog refers to my having breast cancer on 4 different occasions. That’s the bad news. The good news is I’m still alive 26 years later to blog about it, with no evidence of metastasis (yet). I also inherited a faulty BRCA1 gene from my mother which is something (probably the only thing) Angelina Jolie and I have in common. Given my first cancer was in the dark ages of 1988 (pre-internet and pre-pink ribbon hoopla) at age 29 and my fourth was in 2011 at the ripe age of 52, I have seen medical advice come and go but really not much has changed in terms of things like treatment and survival. I am hoping this course will show me how to set up a blog that others will choose to follow. Sh Tweet Like this: Like Loading...",1,-1,-0.024999999999999988
905,48,6,[Timestamp('2015-02-04 00:00:00')],"After 4 breast cancers since 1988, I’ve lost track of the usual markers of cancerversaries. I can remember month and year of diagnoses but can no longer keep specific dates in my head. Also, there is confusion about what date to use for 3 of my cancers where the words and behavior of mammogram technicians and doctors resulted in my”knowing” I had cancer before the official biopsy results were in. In any event, February 1988 marked my first breast cancer diagnosis at 29. That makes it 27 years of “living on borrowed time” as that first cancer was caught by me through a fluke of accidentally touching the right place at the right time and following up immediately with my doctor. Had it not been for the accidental touch, the tumor would have continued to grow and may well have spread into Stage 4 cancer. Last year, I was very excited about making it to 26 years since first diagnosis. Maybe part of what makes me uneasy about claiming 27 years of survival is that I had a total of 4 breast cancers during this period. Other people seem to count their survival status as cancer free time and start counting again from zero once they have had a recurrence. If that is the “right” way to do things, I guess I am only a 3.5 year survivor as my last breast cancer was in July, 2011. Do people think I am a fraud claiming 27 years of survivorship when many of those years were spent in treatment for new primary cancers and recurrences? I am always careful to say 27 years from first diagnosis so I don’t think I am misleading anyone. What really has me bothered this year is that for the last 6 weeks or so, my Facebook feed has been filled by the deaths of so many young breast cancer patients. It seems every 2 or 3 days, someone from one of my Facebook groups has passed on, leaving a young family behind. This year I felt uncomfortable announcing 27 years of survival from first diagnosis under the circumstances of all the surrounding death in the air. Some people say they draw hope from my longevity, particularly in light of the multiple bouts of triple negative cancer, my BRCA1 status, and my lack of what would now be considered optimal treatment for someone with my history. On the other hand, I don’t doubt that it strikes resentment in some people’s hearts that I continue to live despite all the odds stacked against me while others die shortly after diagnosis or after being told their prognosis was excellent as their cancer was detected early, they received aggressive treatment, and they were BRCA negative. Announcing 27 years of longevity in this atmosphere, seems a bit like bragging or gloating, which is the last thing I want to do. I have no idea why I am still alive considering all the cards stacked against me. All I can do is get philosophical and say this just isn’t my time to die. I have no secrets for longevity or avoiding Mets and we all know I have no secrets for avoiding recurrences! Along with the tragic death announcements, there has been an increase in the amount of posts from women speculating on what caused their cancer and what they can do to prevent a recurrence. I have no answers for either causation or prevention. I have said before that cancer seems pretty random to me striking both triathlete vegans and self-admitted couch potatoes and everyone in between. I have yet to see a strong pattern or have an aha moment where all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place for me. The same goes for recurrences and metastasis. Those who radically change their eating habits and make other lifestyle changes seem as likely to have their cancer come back as a recurrence or a metastasis as do those who change very little. After 27 years of watching cancer prevention tips come and go and sometimes be turned completely around (I just read that high doses of soy are good for preventing cancer after 20 years of it being cited as a cancer promotor), I personally have little faith in these promises of prevention or a cure. Along with the string of deaths, there seem to be an unusually high number of women experiencing either local recurrences or Mets. The combination of the deaths and the disease progression have created high levels of anxiety in the support groups. You start to wonder if you are next in line for some cancer catastrophe to strike your life. This probably explains all the comments about cancer causation and prevention. I want to feel good about my 27 years of post-diagnosis survival. The road has been hard and bumpy and like everyone else, I have no idea what is around the next corner. I have spun the cancer Wheel of Fortune 4 times now and have been lucky to have only local recurrences. But how many times can you spin that wheel and avoid the slots marked for metastasizes and death? I think I have used up all my get out of jail free cards and if forced to spin again, I don’t anticipate a 5th local recurrence. Intellectually, I know the deaths and disease progressions will level out in time. But in the meantime, these events are extremely stressful for everyone involved. It’s not a good time to be celebrating a long-term cancerversary in the midst of all this pain. So I will be privately pleased to still be alive and able to watch my children grow up. At the same time, I will continue to mourn for the lives lost or forever altered by new recurrences or metastic disease. This will be a very quiet celebration of life and one that I will not take for granted. Thinking of my fallen pink sisters, I think “there but for the grace of God go I”. Sharon Greene.

914,50,6,[Timestamp('2015-09-26 00:00:00')],"Sandra Lee--a celebrity chef on The Food Network--has been sharing her tumultuous breast cancer battle with the public for the past six months on social media and every time she posts an update it brings back memories of my own cancer journey. Sandra Lee at The Emmy Awards She opened up about her emotional roller coaster ride when she lost her double D breasts back in May. She had a setback in August due to an infection that landed her back in the hospital for an operation. In spite of that, she showed her strength and bounced back when she walked down the red carpet at the Emmy Awards in a plunging and stunning ballgown that was clearly designed for a woman with cleavage. Sandra was sending a clear message to Hollywood and the world that her breasts did not define her or take away from her beauty. The picture says it all. Sandra said the pastel-pink gown had been hanging in her closet for years but she could never fit into it because it was too tight across the chest--what with her being a double D cup size. As a breast cancer survivor who had six surgeries in order to complete breast reconstruction, Sandra is showing women like her the way back to health is not without a few bumps in the road. But whatever hurdles you must jump, maintaining a fighting spirits gets you to the finish line faster. Sandra has said: I just want to move on with my life. Oh, how I feel her pain on that point. I remember thinking: For the love of God, when will the chemo, the surgeries and the radiation finally be over? It ended for me and it will end for Sandra, too. Sandra Lee gets blessed by The Pope for the second time After normalcy kicks back into your life for five, six years,you will appreciate someone like Sandra Lee reminding you how very tough that journey was. It's worth taking a moment to feel gratitude. On that note, I found it interesting that The Pope talked about the importance of daily gratitude at the evening mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City last Thursday night. Sandra Lee was there and The Pope asked that she come forward out of the pews so he could bless her. The next day, at the 9/11 Memorial, The Pope blessed her yet again! Sandra still has reconstructive surgery ahead of her, which could throw yet more curve balls her way. Then she will probably have to go on medication for five years. But she's been deemed cancer free, she's been blessed by The Pope--twice, and she held her own on the red carpet alongside Hollywood's A-list actresses WITHOUT her Double-Ds.

925,55,5,[Timestamp('2016-02-21 00:00:00')],"It’s February in Sacramento. California snow has been falling – blossoms from neighborhood fruit trees dusting the ground with white, or pink, depending on the fruit. This is the reason so many of us put up with California’s high prices, unresponsive government, and unrelenting taxes – this glorious, glorious weather. While much of the country is still buried in snow, shivering, our Sacramento spring has arrived. Last week the weather was in the upper 70s. People are out gardening, pulling weeds away from the daffodils. The urge to plant new flowers overwhelms even me, a woman with the blackest of thumbs. The weather will chill again, temporarily, but springtime weather has undeniably begun. Last week, my sister was visiting. I’d pulled the ultimate bait and switch on her, a con worthy of Slippin’ Jimmy. She’d made plans to come see me months ago when I was struggling with severe abdominal pain, the knowledge of cancer spreading through my abdomen and the thought that this time, it might be unstoppable. This new growth had jumped out of my liver and was seeding everywhere, including spots in my lungs. It had the potential to be the beginning of the end, we all thought so. By the time her plane pulled into the airport, I’d had 4 infusions of my 9th treatment regimen, Kadcyla aka TDM1, and was in remission, my second. It happened with breathtaking speed, from remission to cancer explosion to remission again. This is the easiest chemo I’d ever done, the pain is much better, energy level higher, and I’m able to think about the near future without worry again. Even my chemo brain seems to be recovering; concentration improved. I can read again and do puzzles that I haven’t been able to focus on for years. I have some pain, always now, but it is being managed well. My only new side effect is neuropathy - numb fingers and toes. A very small price to pay. My sister and I had a nice, girlish visit. A visit to a salon, shopping and lunch at Nordstrom. For me, a very full day, lots of walking. We came home and were chatting in my living room, both of us idly looking out my picture window to the street. Part of my view is blocked by a neighbor’s fence which encloses his front yard, built after he moved in. I remember when I could look out the window and see the whole of my pretty, post-war curvy street with its small, neat little homes, wave to my neighbors from the porch, see the blooming trees and flowers beyond. With that fence, I’m now cut off from half the neighborhood, my street starting right in front of my house, the light diminished and the house darker. Because of the fence, I heard laughing before I saw them. A car’s hood silently appeared, then four young men and a girl pushing a vehicle of the kind I had driven for decades: nondescript, old. A beater, we called it, the color the same rusty red as the leftover blood on a cotton ball after a poke. My street is on a slight incline so they were pushing uphill, two boy’s backs on the car’s trunk, wiry leg muscles straining, another positioned on the right side of the car, pushing from the open door. Inside, predictably, a girl steering, and beside her, another male. The boys, as I call them, were really young men. All had long hair, short sleeves, and could have been anywhere from 17 to 27 for all I could tell. They were laughing despite the circumstances, weather making it impossible to be unhappy, even in the face of lost transportation. I watched a minute and paid silent homage to all of my old beaters who had to be pushed off the road after some mysterious piece inside stopped working. How many times had I been that girl, steering, as others pushed me out of danger? Thank goodness those days are over. I turned away. My sister spoke, in a slightly urgent voice. “They’re thirsty, Ann.” “What?” I said, confused. “How do you know?” “They just are.” “Did you hear them say something?” I looked at her. I was confused, both by the urgency and certainty in her voice. “It’s hot.” She repeated. “They’re thirsty.” “Okay.” I went to the kitchen. I had four bottles of water left, sitting on the floor near the fridge, still inside the protective wrapper that was slightly dusty from dog hair. (If you come to my house and do not see animal hair, you know I have reached the end. And, my husband as well.) I ripped off the plastic overlay, grabbed the (clean) bottles and walked outside. “Hey, are you guys thirsty?” They looked at me, this skinny, bare-footed, frizzy-haired, gray-haired old lady and determined I wasn’t coming out with a broom to scream, “You kids, get offa my lawn!” One smiled and answered, “Kinda, yeah.” So I handed a water bottle to each, and apologized for being one short. The boy and girl in the front thanked me, said they didn’t mind sharing. Young love. I wished them luck and went back inside. My sister and I were not the only people who’d seen these kids. Across the street another neighbor had been out washing his car, a weekly chore for him even in the drought. (In case the water cops are reading this, he uses a bucket and never allows water to run.) He’d seen these kids coming too and like me, ignored them as they struggled by. Finishing their swigs of water, these kids started pushing again, but this time the neighbor decided to help too. He centered himself on the back of the car and gave a mighty heave. His powerful muscles, along with the boys’ skinny ones, did the trick. The car began rolling easily up the hill. Cheers erupted. My sister, by sensing their needs, had started a tiny chain of kindness. Had she not told me that she felt they were thirsty, I definitely wouldn’t have considered it. My neighbor also would not have helped without seeing me come out and bring water; they had already passed him by the time I got outside. There is a saying, “When a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world it can cause a hurricane in another part of the world."" The same can be true for these random acts of kindness. Who knows when these kids themselves may do something kind for somebody they don’t know? In this instance, the butterfly is my sister. There are so many other butterflies out there, we should be beset by hurricanes. I’ve been the recipient of more kindnesses than I can count, and to this day, continue to be blessed by the generosity of others. From simple things, like starting an Amazon shopping trip from my blog, to cards, to gifts sent, it’s opened my eyes to the world of human generosity that somehow, I had totally missed until I got sick. I recently read Sue Klebold’s book, A Mother’s Reckoning. You will remember her as the mother of one of the Columbine shooters. Like most of the country, I was horrified by Columbine, and then fascinated to the point where I have read every document about it. Much of what you think you know about Columbine has turned out to be bad reporting that has become folklore. (For the definitive book on Columbine, read David Cullen’s work.) Early on, as this tragic story unfolded, I, as so many others, wondered how a mother could miss signs of her child intending mass murder – and surely there were signs, right? Age, maturity, and cancer taught me better. I know deeply now that some things are inexplicable and unknowable - like the reasons for cancer, like the hidden thoughts of a suicidal teenager. What strikes me in her book is how many others didn’t make those kinds of snap judgments that I did. Sue writes of receiving many thousands of letters with words of support. These were people who were able to give: give her the benefit of the doubt, give her support at the worst time of her life, maybe even our country’s life, even when the media was attacking her and we were all afraid for our children. People like my sister, people like all who have reached out to me in one way or another, to try to comfort and help, are links in this chain of kindness. You are the wings of the butterfly, spreading the breeze of love through the world. It is the obligation of the rest of us, whose first nature may not be to reach out, to learn pass along the gifts of understanding and kindness we’ve been given, and to let the chain become unbroken. It may start with a bottle of water and a nudge, but that’s a good enough start. I challenge those of you reading this – as I challenge myself – to do a kind thing for somebody else this week. And notice when somebody is kind to you - when somebody allows you to squeeze in on a busy street, when you drop something and somebody picks it up for you. All of these small random acts of kindness truly do have an impact on the experience and lives of others. Report back here what you did, what was done for you, if you like.",1,1,0.08659200043653822

Hit the ground running with a new social media campaign... October is now available. And if you act now, we will give you pink- for free! October can now be yours. For all the marketing, media and promotional campaigns who are seeking a disease to sell products, October is now open for a new, fresh approach. Pick a disease, any disease and support that instead. ALS is hot, hot, hot right now. Imagine an ice bucket challenge in chilly October? There are thousands of diseases to choose from. Everyone is aware of breast cancer. Everyone. These ""awareness"" campaigns actually take away from true research (and other diseases) because all the money is being spent being ""publicly aware."" Slap a pink ribbon on and you have done your part. Declare you are all for Saving the Tatas and with a wink and a smile you are not only aware, but you are a little naughty. It has finally culminated in the basest form of cause marketing. This very well could be the straw that broke the pink camel's back. The Facebook challenge cashing in on breast cancer is asking women to go bra-less on October 13 to ""Support Breast Cancer."" Healthy women of all ages displaying their bra-less images on their Facebook profiles will ""help"" women afflicted with breast cancer? That is why they will be doing it? Or is it yet another calculated target at the narcissistic mania of featuring yourself on your Facebook page doing something ""noble-looking"" that all your friends can ""like"" and comment on? ""You look gorgeous!"" and ""Great tits!"" will fill the comment section. The adoration will be lapped up and more and more images will appear. Ice buckets will be poured over bra-less women to turn it into a wet T-shirt contest. Wait for it, you will see it. Just how will that translate to ending breast cancer? It won't. If you want to show off your wet t-shirt selves, do it because you want to show off, don't pretend you are saving lives. And, for those of you object to this new campaign, be prepared for some rather nasty blow back. The KJR 95.7 Facebook page, one of many promoting it, had some women speaking out on the insensitivity and stupidity of this campaign, now in its second year. Sara K. objected to a bra-less day post by saying the following: ""This is disgusting. An illness that takes the lives of so many women shouldn't have to be noticed just because it was fit to please the male gaze. There is more to breast cancer than saving breasts, it's saving a HUMAN."" Here are a few of the thousands of replies, exactly as they appeared: From Denise R. ""Whatever, my grandmother has breast cancer, which means I am a slightly higher risk for cancer. I support this type of marketing because it gets us money. It gets the research done. Don't get your panties in a bunch. Stop feeling bad for people with cancer -- so because you have cancer, you shouldn't be around sex, or sex related material? My brother had brain cancer -- he loves to make jokes about it. STFU. Why are people so fucking serious??? So because you had cancer you stop being human? If you're so depressed to think about this as offensive, then get treatment. For depression. Fast."" From Anthony W. ""There is always one person like yourself that can always ruin fun for everyone else."" From Joseph D. ""Just zip it b!tch &; show me your tits!...your going 2 show them 2 somebody !...so ""why not "" me?"" From Brandie N. ""Bras are a MAJOR factor causing breast cancer you daft bimbo. No woman should ever wear a bra!"" From Eben L. ""Lol here comes the term referred to as calm down by saying ""calm your tits"" ...

These campaigns do nothing for breast cancer except bring out the worst in people. So if any other disease would like the spotlight this October, take it. It's yours.

But it broke through the duct and became invasive. Invasive triple negative breast cancer. Because of this I had to do chemotherapy and radiation. That was in 2001. Over the next few years I met some wonderful women through my foundation. One young woman became a dear friend. Her name was Ferne Dixon. Her picture is on the right of this blog and always will be in eternal memory. She had triple negative breast cancer, too. But she did not get screened early and because of this the tumor was found after it became quite invasive. Like Ferne, young, black women are at a higher risk of developing triple negative breast cancer while they are in their 30s. If they wait to be screened until they are 40 - or now as the new guidelines suggest 50 - it will be too late. I promised Ferne as she was dying of this horrible disease, that I would do everything in my power to spread the word about the importance of early screening so young women would have a chance to become old women and not die of a disease that could have been treated and possibly overcome. Now, after an exhaustive study, the experts are stating that early detection does, indeed, prolong life. They have proof. It can be found here. What the study shows is that the smaller the tumor, the longer the survival. The more lymph nodes involved and the larger the tumor the long term survival is not as favorable. With new targeted treatments and the effectiveness of hormonal medications, even women with a more advanced disease are living longer. This applies only to women who are responsive to endocrine therapy. My second cancer was estrogen receptor positive and it was large and involved the lymph nodes. Reading the graph is frightening knowing my pathology. But I am glad I did a year of strong chemo and had extensive radiation and am taking Femara. At least I am fighting it. What about the women who haven't been screened so they do not know they have to fight? As everyone knows, we are firmly anti-pink at No Surrender. Sometimes that message is misunderstood to mean that we are anti-early detection. That has never, ever been the case. Look at our program The Before Forty Initiative - here - and you will see how strongly we believe in screening. This screening is not just mammograms, which can miss some tumors. We encourage fighting for ultrasounds and breast MRI's - particularly for young women with dense breast tissue. If you do anything in this pink month, set the record straight. Opposing pink greed is not opposing being smart and taking care of yourself and the ones you love. If you would like to start a Before Forty Initiative Outreach in your area, please contact us. We travel everywhere we can find women who don't know of their risks. We have made a difference. Tumors have been found in young women. And every time I am thanked by them or their mom or grandmother, I think of Ferne. I know she is smiling and telling me, ""Keep it up, girl.""

1066,66,4,[Timestamp('2015-10-01 00:00:00')],"It's October. Oh holy hell. Not again. Everyone is asking me to either say something or participate in something pink. Why? When have I ever been pink? I was first diagnosed in September - so I had to go through the first horrifying month of chemo in a sea of pink ribbons and happy faces. In the real world, I slept on the bathroom floor because I was so sick from treatment I had to. Breast Cancer is a cancer just as real as any other. But for some reason, this particular cancer is downgraded and infantilized. The focus is on ""Saving the Boobies!"" not saving the lives of the 250,000 women who are diagnosed each year with over 40,000 dying of the disease annually. No. It is easier to make it pretty in pink. Easier for whom? In the past week I was asked if my foundation, ""Gets a lot of donations because it is October?"" Uh, no. People are too tapped out from buying pink toilet paper and pink fuel filters and pink shoelaces and pink ... everything. As I was checking out at a local store today the cashier asked if I would like to ""Give to breast cancer?"" Give what? What more can I possibly give? I asked her which breast cancer? She said, ""You know, the one that you give to."" I bit my tongue and said, no. Nevertheless, it is upon us. In its full pink glory. Everyone looks so happy. The idiotic glee celebrating rapidly duplicating cells that are attempting to claim your life. This misguided and dangerous joy is hurting the women who are afflicted with this cancer. It is devastating to the women who are dying from this cancer. How do you explain the giddy excitement of Pinktober to a child who lost their mom? I know a lot of kids who lost moms. Trust me. They aren't having as much fun as the pink zombies want you to believe they are. But no matter, as long as one percent of your purchase price goes to ""a breast cancer charity"" you should feel really great about doing your bit for breast cancer. I run a non-profit foundation for women trying to get through breast cancer and we have never exploited the month of October for fundraising purposes. Why? Because women have breast cancer twelve months a year. And we help women during every single one of them. Our care doesn't stop after Halloween. I do not use profanity in my writing, I keep things clean and professional. But, sometimes, only someone who really gets it, can put things into perspective. I wish everyone took breast cancer as seriously as other cancers. Other cancers like the one that took Warren Zevon. He wrote this in response to his diagnosis and treatment. It's not pink. Neither is breast cancer. Cancer is cancer. And the next time someone asks you to wear a pink boa and act like a child, please remember that THIS is what having cancer feels like...",1,1,0.015097402597402602
1129,69,9,[Timestamp('2009-10-30 00:00:00')],"I am always on the fence with breast cancer awareness month. I like that there is awareness brought to this awful disease so that women (and men!) can be proactive about their health. We all need reminders and if the sea of pink doesn't remind you, you have bigger issues than getting regular screenings. But then there are the pink haters who tell you about all the companies that make millions off the cause marketing. How many businesses would do anything that does not improve the bottom line? Hello? No company makes a donation without expecting something in return whether that is a tax break, good public perception, good employee morale, or (gasp!) profit. Many companies choose to go pink because it is good for them. Why is this shocking to some? Now, how I support it is different. I do not purchase everything featuring the pink ribbon. I buy a product if I like or need it. If that company also supports breast cancer, then I think that is a great bonus. Do I support my local neighbor kids when they put up a lemonaid stand? Absolutely. Do I buy soup featuring a pink label? Not likely. The sodium in that stuff will kill you! When my friendly grocery checker asks if I want to donate a dollar to cancer research, I often donate. When I see pink bags of pink candy coated chocolate candies that melt in your mouth not in your hand I run from those too. Sugar? Fat? Not friends if you are fighting cancer. I also simply write a check and make donations that I know go directly to research. Or I get involved in cancer walks and relays. Never once did I think pink marketing would end cancer, but I do believe it makes us aware and reminds to get regular screenings. This is very important. If you want to buy pink candy, socks, ties, soup, and ribbons, go for it. I won't judge you. I would suggest that if you are doing it to benefit cancer research, then be smart about it. Make sure the label states exactly how much is going to be donated. ""A portion of the proceeds..."" is not good enough. It should be specific, such as ""20% of the proceeds"" or ""$5 from the sale of this item."" And I will admit, I did my own fair share of shopping this month. I bought the Brighton Power of Pink bracelet (above). I have each of their annual bracelets since they started the collection. This one is my favorite. It is covered in hearts. It was meant for me, right? And I also ran across these. I have no idea how much Master Lock will make off these products, but they do state they will donate $15,000 to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I like them because they are cute and girlie and pink and they are great products. I would have bought a lock anyway, but since they were pink I bought two. Want one? Let me know. More importantly, do your monthly self check and schedule your mammogram already. You didn't forget, did you? Labels: awareness, Spreading the love",1,1,0.15615384615384617
1197,9,10,[Timestamp('2010-11-13 00:00:00')],"So the latest post-surgical update is that I STILL have not had my drain removed (sigh). I did go in last week to see Dr. Amos, and he injected an anti-biotic, doxycycline, up my drain, in the hopes that it would cause scarring in the area where my lymph nodes were removed on my right side, thus allowing the fluid in my body to by-pass the drain and be reabsorbed into my system. I can't have the drain removed until the fluid output is less than 30ml/day. Yesterday it was 45ml. Today seems to be hovering around 30-40. So unless tomorrow I drop below 30 ml, it looks like the damn drain stays in. I do have an appointment for this upcoming Nov 16 to see Dr. Amos again--at which point I will have had this drain in me for approximately 29 days or 4 weeks, since it will be 4 weeks come Monday that I'd had my bi-lateral mastectomy surgery. (big, big, sigh). I'm tired. Physically I'm tired from the surgery and lingering effects of the chemo (which can linger for up to 6 months). Psychologically and emotionally I'm tired of dealing with this drain. It is cumbersome. Imagine having a foot of tubing coming out of your body, about 4 inches below your right armpit. Imagine that it ended in a bulb slightly smaller than a deflated tennis ball and it was being held in place to your body by black surgical thread that tugged and hurt when you moved your right hand/arm in certain positions. And this is in addition to the aches and pains from the mastectomy surgery--my left side is still a bit sore and the sutures on my chest are starting to itch. Now, I want to say that all of this is very manageable--by which I mean, I'm not in so much pain that I require pills nor is this keeping me from fairly normal day to day activities. I can drive my car. I try to walk 1-2 miles a day. I keep up with my physical therapy exercises. I can cook and clean and when I wear the right combination of clothes, I can go out and about in the world without anyone knowing that there is anything different about me. But it is wearing on me--having this drain in me also requires daily attention and I am sometimes reminded that I am attached to it very acutely (like when it starts to really pain me at the end of the day). And I also have to think twice about doing some very basic things--like dressing myself or taking a shower or lifting something with my right hand. I'm *hoping* that tomorrow the scarring will really have worked and I can get this drain removed on Tuesday. Either that or I will need to have this procedure repeated, I imagine--I'll be writing to Dr. Amos to give him an update tonight. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will be closer to 35 if not 30. So beyond the lingering remnant of having this drain, emotionally I'm doing OK. I've had a few melt down/crying jags post-surgery, as one could imagine, all of which coincide with me taking a shower. I think it's just hard for me to deal with the pain of showering (and it's uncomfortable to shower and requires a lot more thought and time and care than I normally require without this drain) and because it is weird to confront my body without my breasts but perhaps more with the scars and other parts of my chest looking so foreign. It's just really weird to have part of my body missing. And I want to say more about that later. But what I wanted to acknowledge in this post are the ways that I'm already thinking ahead to marking and honoring this experience. Because I think it's important that I do something to acknowledge what I've gone through. Certainly this blog is one way that I've marked my experience--quite literally through the writing I've done around my diagnosis and treatment and surgery. And it has been enormously therapeutic for me to use language as a tool for my processing of this experience and for my healing. Yet I also want to mark and more importantly honor this experience in other ways. Because it has changed me. I mean, of course it would--but I suppose what I mean is that for all the ways in which I've resisted typical cancer and especially breast cancer narratives, I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel somehow different after what I've gone through. And I have been thinking about what I want to do to mark and honor that type of change or this process or this trial....I still am not sure what kind of language to use to talk about my cancer. And I still think of it in the present tense, even after the chemo and the surgery. Because I just don't know that I'll really ever feel that I am cancer-free. I know that in the here and now I am N.E.D.--no evidence of disease. I know that I will one day, hopefully sooner than later, start to feel like a healthy person. Like I'm back to being me--that my hair will grow back in (it already is) and that I will gain back my energy and I will be back in the classroom and back to writing my manuscript and it will almost be like nothing has changed. Almost. How to mark and honor that which cannot be fully rendered explicable and communicable? How to mark and honor an experience that has been so difficult and painful and yet, in some ways, ordinary. I say ordinary not because I think it's ""normal"" to have gone through chemo and surgery and a cancer diagnosis, but ordinary because I think so many people have gone through and go through periods in their lives when they are not healthy--when they are impaired and lack energy and where negotiating everyday aspects of their lives seems like a herculean feat. It's also hard to write about let alone think of marking and honoring an event that I'm still in the middle of--the surgery was only 4 weeks ago, I still have a drain in me, I will be on tomoxifen (a hormone treatment) for 5 years, and rates of remission are usually judged in 5 year increments. Yet another reason why I don't see myself as a cancer patient past tense. And honoring...I thought carefully before using that word in this post. But it is one I choose deliberately--that I do want to honor this experience. Not because I am ""glad"" I had cancer and that it has ""taught"" me certain lessons. It's more that I want to acknowledge that this happened to me--and that what happened to me cut to my ontological and existential core. It has marked me, and I want to mark and honor the experience--to acknowledge that I have changed and to give it the gravity of acknowledgement that it deserves. Anyway, I haven't quite decided what I will do--but I know it will not be a singular gesture. For example, I have decided to get a tattoo on my left inner ankle. I was going to do this in solidarity with my cousin Eileen when she and Jeanine (another favorite cousin) were visiting last weekend. [This is Eileen wearing my strawberry syrup wig--I think she wears it better than I do!] [Here's Jeanine at our dining room table--I swear I have a photo in almost the identical body language--we are startlingly similar to one another in that way] However, with the drain still in me, I decided (and was advised) that it was better to wait. And I realized that getting a tattoo could be one way that I would literally mark myself--so while waiting for Eileen to get her tattoo done, I decided that I would go back and get a tattoo of a lotus, because I like they symbolism (and the actual look) of the lotus--and especially with the Buddhist meditation I used to do (and hope to get back into), I thought it was fitting to have a symbol of life and mortality. [This is not the exact tattoo image I have in mind, but it gives you an idea of what I'm thinking of] I also plan to run a 4 mile race in April, in preparation for one day running a half-marathon. I've never run in a race before, yet always wanted to. So I figure training for the 4 mile run and the half-marathon would be ways I could heal (and get stronger) and be another way to mark this experience. And I imagine that there will be other ways that I will want to mark and honor what I've been through. A party might be nice (for those of you living in the Chapel Hill area, you will note that this is the first year in 6 years that I have not thrown an annual ""housewarming"" party--we're hoping to make it a belated ""housewarming"" and cancer anniversary party in April--so stay tuned!) and a trip somewhere might be nice. And maybe writing about this, as an essay or an academic article, a conference paper, or dare I say it: as a book, might be nice. I will have to think about what feels right to me as time passes. And I know I have to be open to changing my mind about all of this. Anyway, I'm open to suggestions from the blogosphere (and from friends near and far) and I will certainly keep you posted about the drain situation after Nov. 16. [UPDATE--MONDAY, NOV 15: Two friends, Jim & Ashley, just sent me a link to this NY Times Magazine essay questioning the pinkwashing of breast cancer activism--the ways in which a narrative and rhetoric of breast cancer as sexy and a disease that women will kick butt in has trumped other types of stories and experiences of the disease. When I read it, I felt like Peggy Ornstein had been in my head and reading this blog. I'm glad to know that mine is not the only dissenting voice about breast cancer out there]",1,1,0.06316607634789452
1198,9,11,[Timestamp('2011-10-22 00:00:00')],"A week ago a friend of mine, Greg, posted on my Facebook page that he half expected to hear me during an NPR piece lamenting breast cancer awareness month (click here for the link to the story, where you can also hear the piece). And, of course, I've never been the only person who has expressed a distaste for the pink ribbon (although I might be the only person to have a blog decrying them as ""fucking"" pink ribbons--those missing asterisks don't leave much for the imagination). Karuna Jaggar, executive director of Breast Cancer Action, recently discussed the insidious pink-washing being done every October on the WBUR NPR show, ""On the Point."" But I do find it heartening not to be the only one questioning pink ribbon culture. There is Samantha King's work, which I've written about previously (and the film version, I hope, will reach LOTS OF PEOPLE). And there's Gayle Sulik's book, Pink Ribbon Blues, which also questions the dark underbelly of pink ribbon culture. And of course there's Barbara Ehrenreich's essay, ""Welcome to Cancerland."" But it also seems like more and more people are really questioning what's going on with breast cancer philanthropy and whether we have ""pink fatigue"" and the efficacy of breast cancer research--the fact that only 3% of breast cancer funding goes to treating metastatic breast cancer--which is the stage IV kind that kills women--it's the kind emblemized in those stats that tell us that breast cancer is the 2nd leading cause of death for women. Women don't die of stage I, II, or III breast cancer, and usually they don't die due to complications in treatment (although it does occasionally happen). Women (and the few men who are diagnosed) die because their cancer has metastized to other parts of their body (and this blog that I recently discovered chronicles what it's like to live with metastatic cancer, as well as the frustration at the lack of funding for metastatic cancer treatment). And this should make us ANGRY. And we should turn our anger into ACTIVISM. Because really, the time for awareness is over. We all know about breast cancer. We all know someone who has had breast cancer. And we certainly all know someone who has had SOME type of cancer. So what we need, right now, is action. We need to get mad and we need to do something. Not to just detect it early. Not to just get appropriate treatment. But to try to prevent anyone from ever getting this disease and needing treatment. Just what type of action to take...I suppose this is part of the problem. I'm thinking on it. And if you have suggestions, please post them. I really do want to be part of the solution--to be an activist not just someone who raises awareness every October. And certainly not by wearing or buying anything associated with a pink ribbon.",1,1,0.027130832130832137
1201,9,14,[Timestamp('2011-09-18 00:00:00')],"So I'm sure we are all familiar with the very emotional and sentimental films featuring stoic women (and usually they are women although sometimes, as in Brian's Song, they are men). Love Story and Terms of Endearment top the list of these sorts of films. Well, Pink Ribbon Inc. and 50/50 do not seem to fit into that mold. Neither of these films is out, just yet. But my friend Anita sent me the trailer to Pink Ribbons Inc. and I am very excited to see this film when it comes out (hopefully in early 2012, although I may spring for the DVD which you can buy on their website). The Canadian filmmakers who produced this film were inspired by Samantha King's book of the same name--the film, like the book, seems to take a critical look at the pink ribbon industry that has been built up over the last decade--the many different consumer items that are branded with the pink ribbon and sold in the name of research and finding a cure. Which makes it feel like you are making a profit off of a disease--at least it makes me feel that way sometimes depending on my mood. I still see those pink ribbons everywhere--most recently on a box of Morton's Salt that I bought at my local grocery store. There were two boxes of salt sold for the same price, one had a pink ribbon and the other didn't. Not sure why--wouldn't it seem as if the box with the pink ribbon should be more expensive because if Morton's is giving money for breast cancer research it would want people buying the pink ribbon salt to pay a nickel more to help women with breast cancer? I know I've written about King's book and my own reaction to Pink Ribbon commercialization before (click here). I hope this film reaches a lot of people--certainly more people would watch this film than would pick up King's book, so I'm glad in that way that her message and the critique of the corporatization of the pink ribbon will get the audience it deserves--and hopefully will get people thinking about what they are buying when they make a conscious choice to purchase a pink ribbon item. As for the film 50/50, I saw the trailer in the movie theater recently and became VERY EXCITED because this seems to be a film geared towards the average person who either has had a cancer diagnosis and/or their friends and family--and we all just are overwhelmed and clueless about how to proceed. Today one of the stars and writer/producer's of the film, Seth Rogen, along with his friend and co-writer and inspiration for the film, Will Reiser, were on Weekend Edition Sunday talking about making the film and about Reiser's own cancer diagnosis (which the film is loosely based upon). Listening to them talk about making the film was refreshing. Because the truth is, when you have this diagnosis, when you are living with cancer and going through treatment, there are so MANY THINGS THAT SEEM ABSURD. And you or at least I couldn't dwell on the tragedy of it all and had to see the comedy or the absurdity in my situation. And being able to laugh is a great therapy in and of itself. As is anger, I think--which is why I titled the blog No Fucking Pink Ribbons. Anyway, I leave you with trailers for both films--50/50 will open on September 30 and I hope Pink Ribbons Inc. comes to my local independent theater--if not, I'm definitely springing for the film, because I know it is a must watch for me.

1203,9,16,[Timestamp('2013-02-28 00:00:00')],"I should really have posted this a week ago -- I sometimes forget that I have this blog (awful, I know) and then I remember and I think about all the things I want to be writing in this space, could be writing in this space and SHOULD be writing in this space. Like this upcoming symposium at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. Because this is such short notice, only folks who live in the greater NC area will probably be able to come (unless, of course, you were aware of this symposium much earlier). I'll be giving a full report because I'm going both Friday & Saturday. But for any of you who do live driving distance to Winston-Salem, please consider checking out at least Saturday's offerings--you can find the program of events on the Wake Forest Humanities Institute Page (click here). The conference is free and is devoted to examining breast cancer narratives and counter narratives--like critiquing pink ribbon culture. So OF COURSE I had to go--I mean, look at the keynote speaker and what she's going to talk about: KEYNOTE ADDRESS: “The Self-Telling Body—Who Tells Whom in Breast Cancer Narratives?” Rita Charon, Professor of Clinical Medicine and Executive Director of the Program in Narrative Medicine, Columbia University [That's for Friday night at 6pm] And then, of course, there's this description for the last panel on Saturday: 2:30 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. PANEL: THEORIZING BREAST CANCER NARRATIVES This panel will offer literary, philosophical, and cultural approaches to analyzing breast cancer narratives in the twenty-first century. Topics will include the expansion of visual representations, links between genetic narratives and feminist theories of the body, concepts of the posthuman, analysis of pink ribbon culture, and pragmatist and bioethical inquiry into the lived experience of this disease.

1204,9,17,[Timestamp('2013-03-14 00:00:00')],"So I meant to write about attending the Herstories: Breast Cancer Narratives and CounterNarratives symposium right after I got back on March 2 because it was such a wonderful event and it was eye opening for me in many ways. The first thing I have to say is that I didn't realize how much I wanted to be with other women who had experienced breast cancer. When I was first diagnosed and then going through chemotherapy, many people offered to put me in touch with women who had had breast cancer and friends and relatives (especially those who had gone through their own bouts of cancer) had talked about how important community is and the friends you develop in the chemo chair. But I didn't want that. Not then. When I was in the thick of things, when I was going through chemo and then preparing for surgery and then recovering from surgery, I didn't want to know other women who had gone through breast cancer or who were going through similar things. I know that might sound perverse--it felt perverse at the time. I tried going to yoga at Cornucopia Place and got totally freaked out the one time I went because it was filled with these women who had gone through cancer (mostly breast cancer) and they were laughing and joking and talking about their experiences (and most were post-chemo/surgery -- I think one woman was re-starting chemo but we seemed to be the only 2 women in active treatment) and it really freaked me out. I'm not exactly sure why--maybe because I didn't identify as someone who was NED (no evidence of disease) as many of these women did. Maybe because I was in the thick of things. Maybe because I was angry. So fast forward to March 1 & 2. I'm at Wake Forest University listening to some pretty incredible people talk about their experiences with breast cancer--either from the perspective of being doctors/caregivers or family members of someone with breast cancer or with being women who had the disease. And it was over lunch as I was sitting at a table with two women, both academics, both survivors, that I realized how glad I was to be sitting with them and talking with them about our shared experiences. We exchanged stories about the weird and stupid and odd things that got said to us when we were diagnosed with breast cancer (one woman shared that a friend told her that she didn't seem like the kind of person who got breast cancer, to which she said, ""What's the profile of a breast cancer patient?""--we both totally cracked up at her story--and maybe it's not THAT funny, but at the time it seemed hysterically funny. And it reminded me about the easy camaraderie of the women in the yoga group. I asked one of my tablemates about whether she ever stopped thinking about recurrence now that she was at the 5 year mark (she just had her 5 year check up last month) and she said that it does lessen--that especially that 5 year mark seems significant in terms of turning a mental corner. It was comforting talking with her and with my other tablemate who had finished treatment and was embarking on breast reconstruction. Our experiences were different yet similar--and perhaps one similarity was the desire that all 3 of us had to try to narrate our stories--to try to talk about and write about what we had gone through. That was a large point, perhaps the main point, about this conference--trying to listen to the stories of women going through a breast cancer diagnosis. Trying to hear what women with cancer have to say about the disease and their treatment and their relationships with family and friends, but also to hear about the ways that the disease isn't the only thing that is defining them. People talked about the importance of humor. About empowering women in their decisions and in telling their stories. People talked about resisting the corporatization of breast cancer in its pink ribbon incarnation. People reminded health care professionals (oncologists, surgeons, nurses, radiologists) about the importance of listening, really listening, to what women have to say. And one woman gave this amazing 20 minute power point presentation about the history of breast cancer from the time of the ancients to our present day culture. I am not doing justice to how much I learned and took away from this experience. I not only got to listen and learn, I got to meet and have 1:1 conversations with these panelists (because it was a fairly small conference, about 50-80 on average attended each session). You can click here to see the full conference schedule and I'd definitely recommend trying to google folks whose talks seem interesting. Just to highlight a few, Amy Boesky (Boston College) has a memoir about her family and being positive for the BRCA mutation (she was also recently on NPR where she outed herself as one of the writers of the Sweet Valley High series!). I met Ana Iltis who is editing a journal, Narrative Inquiry in Bioethics, that strives to tell the stories of people who are typically not enfranchised to have their voices heard, and she told this remarkable (and anger producing) story about her husband's aunt who was not treated with respect by the medical establishment. I talked with Kathryn Montgomery, a leading researcher in the field of medical humanities, who shared stories about her daughter's breast cancer (and its recurrence), and I was inspired by Hephzibah Roskelly, a fellow English professor down the road at UNC Greensboro who has talked theorized about her experiences with breast cancer in a way that is so smart and accessible and powerful. All of which left me, at the end of this 2 day event, feeling like I might be ready to try to construct my own narrative about breast cancer.",1,1,0.14676374961185087
1213,9,25,[Timestamp('2011-03-09 00:00:00')],"So here's a confession: I've been depressed. I'm not exactly sure how long I've been depressed, but I definitely think it coincided with being back in the classroom, which means mid-January. Which means probably I've been carrying around a low-level funk for the last three months. I've assumed that it would pass--this feeling of melancholy and sadness that seems to sit with me. I assumed that there is no rational reason for me to feel this way--that I am back in the classroom and resuming my life and so why would I feel depressed? Why should I feel sad? I'm alive. My hair grew back. I'm done with chemotherapy and surgery. The only current treatment I'm on is the tamoxifen. And then today a friend and colleague who has been through a similar experience wrote to me and shared that this period that I'm in--the transition from diagnosis & treatment to life AFTER and INTO, in her phrase, ""a new normal"" or ""new identity"" was very difficult for her. Reading that it hit me: it is difficult for me. I walked to the grocery store and thought about the nature of my depression--just WHY I felt so sad, and I realized that I'm in a state of mourning: I am grieving for my life pre-cancer diagnosis. There is so much grief and mourning that we associate with cancer--and usually we think of it specifically around someone's death--that cancer has claimed so many lives. And that certainly is true--that certainly is the existential heart of why cancer is so fearsome and difficult--because it does claim so many lives. But there's another aspect of mourning and grief related to a cancer diagnosis--and that is the certainty of living your life without the knowledge of cancer. I no longer have that certainty. Now, I just want to be clear. I am not fearful of a recurrence in the sense that I am hyper-anxious or that I'm doing or not doing things because I fear a cancer recurrence. I am also acutely aware that of the various kinds of cancer that one could be afflicted with, having stage 2 breast cancer that has not metastatized is not as traumatic a diagnosis as other kinds of cancer diagnoses. I say this not to rank cancers (because that's like ranking oppressions) but to acknowledge that in many ways I'm lucky. I have a type of cancer that has a lot of exposure/fund raising/research in which women, like myself, have benefitted materially. Once upon a time, breast cancer was a death sentence--and because of all those pink ribbons or more to the point, the money raised and used in research that the pink ribbons helped to bring about, I am the recipient of better treatment protocols and therapies. But even if I think of stage 2 breast cancer as a ""good"" cancer--as a ""curable"" cancer--the truth is, I don't feel cured. I don't feel like I'm cancer free. I don't feel like a survivor. I also don't feel jinxed or unlucky or fated to die an early death. What I do feel is uncertainty. I am just not sure. Not sure whether the cancer will come back. Not sure if it does come back whether it will lead to an earlier death than I would have had. Not sure whether any other aches or pains or bumps on my body are indicative of cancer in other parts of my body that are harder for me to see--my ovaries, my uterus, my liver, my pancreas. And I am in grief and mourning because I feel like however briefly I have thought about it--I am all too aware of my own mortality--of the fragility of my body--that at some point, whether because of cancer or some other force, I will one day die. And to think about your mortality, to feel it keenly, however briefly, is something that stays with you. It's like my mastectomy scars--it's not something I am conscious of 24/7, but it is a permanent reminder on my body, of my body, in my body. I am also in grief and mourning over things that will no longer come to pass--most specifically having a biological child with Matthew. Perhaps this wouldn't have happened regardless of cancer. But the fertility issue was really complicated by chemo and made more impossible by my tamoxifen treatment. And then there's my age--being 41 doesn't exactly spell the height of fertility. So like I said, it's not like this was ever a lock for us--but knowing that my cancer treatments have shut that door has been part of my grief and mourning--even while we both recognize and are excited by a adoption plans (which we aren't enacting just yet since I'd like to say I'm a year cancer-free or at least post-surgery before starting any adoption procedures). I wasn't going to write about any of this--it seemed all too personal and private. But then I thought it was important to put this out there. I'm not exactly sure who is reading this blog anymore, but I know that some people have found their way here because you may also be going through what I'm going through (or went through). And I thought that just as my friend reached out to me and shared part of her own difficulties during this moment of transition, it was important for me to also note that this period of transition is hard. I am sad. And I will be finding help--I've put a call out to a therapist and hopefully will be seeing her soon. Finally, the last thing I'll leave you with is that I think my other reluctance to share this phase that I'm in, is feeling like I have to be strong and to reassure everyone that I'm OK. And I am OK, in the sense that I'm not having any pain or awful side effects -- and that exhaustion/fatigue are really the last lingering vestiges of chemo and surgery that I'm carrying with me in terms of cancer treatment. But in other ways, I'm really not OK. I'm not OK with having this diagnosis. Or having surgery to remove both my breasts. Or living with the tightness around my scars--or sometimes seeing myself in the shower or in the mirror and feeling this tiny shock of seeing myself as if for the first time, breastless.",1,-1,-0.027138965903010848
